00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
welcome everybody
 

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,310
welcome everybody
to the second to last lecture of 6006.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
to the second to last lecture of 6006.
 

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,830
to the second to last lecture of 6006.
uh in this lecture we've mostly covered

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
uh in this lecture we've mostly covered
 

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,470
uh in this lecture we've mostly covered
all of the testable material that we're

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
all of the testable material that we're
 

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,269
all of the testable material that we're
going to

10
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
going to
 

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,550
going to
have on uh the final or

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
have on uh the final or
 

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,990
have on uh the final or
on quiz 3 right today really what we're

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
on quiz 3 right today really what we're
 

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,590
on quiz 3 right today really what we're
talking about is

16
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
talking about is
 

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,430
talking about is
putting into context all the material

18
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
putting into context all the material
 

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,790
putting into context all the material
that we've

20
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
that we've
 

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,830
that we've
learned over the course of the term

22
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
learned over the course of the term
 

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,069
learned over the course of the term
at a high level and talk about where we

24
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
at a high level and talk about where we
 

25
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,270
at a high level and talk about where we
can go from

26
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
can go from
 

27
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,229
can go from
here in terms of other theory classes

28
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
here in terms of other theory classes
 

29
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,750
here in terms of other theory classes
and other classes in the department

30
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
and other classes in the department
 

31
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,229
and other classes in the department
that are related to this material now

32
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
that are related to this material now
 

33
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,150
that are related to this material now
most things in the department are in

34
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
most things in the department are in
 

35
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,549
most things in the department are in
some way related to this material and so

36
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
some way related to this material and so
 

37
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,110
some way related to this material and so
that's why this is a foundational course

38
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
that's why this is a foundational course
 

39
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,470
that's why this is a foundational course
but we're going to try to talk about it

40
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
but we're going to try to talk about it
 

41
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,470
but we're going to try to talk about it
from a high level and

42
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
from a high level and
 

43
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,549
from a high level and
talk about how some future

44
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
talk about how some future
 

45
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,990
talk about how some future
things that you might be interested

46
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
things that you might be interested
 

47
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,789
things that you might be interested
relate okay so

48
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
relate okay so
 

49
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,270
relate okay so
we started out the term in lecture one

50
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
we started out the term in lecture one
 

51
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,670
we started out the term in lecture one
talking about 6006 and we had

52
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
talking about 6006 and we had
 

53
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,510
talking about 6006 and we had
four main goals that we had for our

54
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
four main goals that we had for our
 

55
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,350
four main goals that we had for our
course really three main goals uh

56
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
course really three main goals uh
 

57
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,830
course really three main goals uh
did anyone remember what those goals

58
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
did anyone remember what those goals
 

59
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,190
did anyone remember what those goals
were

60
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
were
 

61
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,469
were
there was uh so uh here was i you got to

62
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
there was uh so uh here was i you got to
 

63
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,510
there was uh so uh here was i you got to
the last one first

64
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
the last one first
 

65
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,469
the last one first
the first one was to solve hard

66
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
the first one was to solve hard
 

67
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,310
the first one was to solve hard
computational problems right to be able

68
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
computational problems right to be able
 

69
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,230
computational problems right to be able
to solve problems

70
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
to solve problems
 

71
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,429
to solve problems
okay so this is kind of like the the

72
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
okay so this is kind of like the the
 

73
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,710
okay so this is kind of like the the
let's uh make an algorithm part of

74
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
let's uh make an algorithm part of
 

75
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,870
let's uh make an algorithm part of
of the course right one solve

76
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
of the course right one solve
 

77
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,550
of the course right one solve
hard computational problems

78
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560

 

79
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,510

i guess hard here maybe should be in

80
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
i guess hard here maybe should be in
 

81
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,069
i guess hard here maybe should be in
quotes

82
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
quotes
 

83
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,550
quotes
because we saw in the last lecture what

84
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
because we saw in the last lecture what
 

85
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,870
because we saw in the last lecture what
hard means in a technical sense

86
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
hard means in a technical sense
 

87
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,150
hard means in a technical sense
right hard could mean that there's no

88
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
right hard could mean that there's no
 

89
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,589
right hard could mean that there's no
efficient algorithm that we know how to

90
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
efficient algorithm that we know how to
 

91
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,070
efficient algorithm that we know how to
solve

92
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
solve
 

93
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,910
solve
a problem on that's getting a little bit

94
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
a problem on that's getting a little bit
 

95
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,110
a problem on that's getting a little bit
of ahead of ourselves

96
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
of ahead of ourselves
 

97
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,510
of ahead of ourselves
computational problems with algorithms

98
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
computational problems with algorithms
 

99
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,390
computational problems with algorithms
is really the key

100
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
is really the key
 

101
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,710
is really the key
part about this goal it's kind of the

102
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
part about this goal it's kind of the
 

103
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,350
part about this goal it's kind of the
same goal that you have in a class like

104
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
same goal that you have in a class like
 

105
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,949
same goal that you have in a class like
601 or 609 right you're trying to

106
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
601 or 609 right you're trying to
 

107
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,510
601 or 609 right you're trying to
convince

108
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
convince
 

109
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,630
convince
a computer that you solved a problem

110
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
a computer that you solved a problem
 

111
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,790
a computer that you solved a problem
okay on a finite set of it inputs

112
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
okay on a finite set of it inputs
 

113
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,509
okay on a finite set of it inputs
but really what this class is about is

114
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
but really what this class is about is
 

115
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,509
but really what this class is about is
two other things

116
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
two other things
 

117
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,670
two other things
which is more about communication to

118
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
which is more about communication to
 

119
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,830
which is more about communication to
people rather than computers

120
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
people rather than computers
 

121
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,589
people rather than computers
right your your algorithm might be

122
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
right your your algorithm might be
 

123
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,990
right your your algorithm might be
correct or efficient

124
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
correct or efficient
 

125
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,350
correct or efficient
but you need to be able to communicate

126
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
but you need to be able to communicate
 

127
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,790
but you need to be able to communicate
that to humans and that's what the other

128
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
that to humans and that's what the other
 

129
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,630
that to humans and that's what the other
two goals are right

130
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
two goals are right
 

131
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,750
two goals are right
so second one is uh

132
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
so second one is uh
 

133
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,380
so second one is uh

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,190
applied 6042
right i've given you some

172
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
right i've given you some
 

173
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,949
right i've given you some
procedures and you have to prove things

174
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
procedures and you have to prove things
 

175
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,390
procedures and you have to prove things
about these procedures or

176
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
about these procedures or
 

177
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,030
about these procedures or
most of the time we proved it for you

178
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
most of the time we proved it for you
 

179
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,030
most of the time we proved it for you
and then you've used them as black boxes

180
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
and then you've used them as black boxes
 

181
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,910
and then you've used them as black boxes
right but that's

182
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
right but that's
 

183
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,910
right but that's
that's a lot of what this class is about

184
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920

 

185
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,229

and the third one is efficiency right

186
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
and the third one is efficiency right
 

187
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,550
and the third one is efficiency right
argue

188
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
argue
 

189
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,990
argue
argue that it's good for lack of a

190
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
argue that it's good for lack of a
 

191
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,309
argue that it's good for lack of a
better thing this is efficiency

192
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
better thing this is efficiency
 

193
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,990
better thing this is efficiency
what does good mean well that was hard

194
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
what does good mean well that was hard
 

195
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,309
what does good mean well that was hard
to know at the beginning of our class

196
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
to know at the beginning of our class
 

197
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,830
to know at the beginning of our class
and so we set up this model of

198
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
and so we set up this model of
 

199
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,990
and so we set up this model of
computation a framework

200
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
computation a framework
 

201
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,189
computation a framework
through which we could determine

202
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
through which we could determine
 

203
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,110
through which we could determine
how good or bad our algorithms were by

204
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
how good or bad our algorithms were by
 

205
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,030
how good or bad our algorithms were by
saying by defining a model of

206
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
saying by defining a model of
 

207
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,469
saying by defining a model of
computation

208
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
computation
 

209
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,390
computation
saying what things we can do in constant

210
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
saying what things we can do in constant
 

211
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,909
saying what things we can do in constant
time and then just

212
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
time and then just
 

213
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,110
time and then just
building off of that right so this is

214
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
building off of that right so this is
 

215
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,870
building off of that right so this is
basically our model

216
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
basically our model
 

217
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,430
basically our model
you know plus some you know asymptotics

218
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
you know plus some you know asymptotics
 

219
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,670
you know plus some you know asymptotics
or something like that

220
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680

 

221
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,270

ran out of space what it's about

222
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
ran out of space what it's about
 

223
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,070
ran out of space what it's about
yeah this is about scalability this is a

224
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
yeah this is about scalability this is a
 

225
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,830
yeah this is about scalability this is a
model of computation tells us how

226
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
model of computation tells us how
 

227
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,629
model of computation tells us how
how much time we can spend but it's

228
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
how much time we can spend but it's
 

229
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,950
how much time we can spend but it's
compared to our input size

230
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
compared to our input size
 

231
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,909
compared to our input size
right this is always about how does our

232
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
right this is always about how does our
 

233
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,790
right this is always about how does our
algorithm

234
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
algorithm
 

235
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,670
algorithm
perform relative to the rate that our

236
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
perform relative to the rate that our
 

237
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,430
perform relative to the rate that our
problem size grows

238
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
problem size grows
 

239
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,670
problem size grows
right and so that's what we mean by good

240
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
right and so that's what we mean by good
 

241
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,590
right and so that's what we mean by good
and in this class we don't

242
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
and in this class we don't
 

243
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,510
and in this class we don't
tend to talk about constant size

244
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
tend to talk about constant size
 

245
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,590
tend to talk about constant size
problems it's about

246
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
problems it's about
 

247
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,790
problems it's about
how algorithms can scale as you have

248
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
how algorithms can scale as you have
 

249
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,310
how algorithms can scale as you have
arbitrarily large inputs

250
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
arbitrarily large inputs
 

251
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,469
arbitrarily large inputs
that's why we need recursion and

252
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
that's why we need recursion and
 

253
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,230
that's why we need recursion and
induction to be able to prove things

254
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
induction to be able to prove things
 

255
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,310
induction to be able to prove things
about our algorithms because they're for

256
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
about our algorithms because they're for
 

257
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,430
about our algorithms because they're for
arbitrary end and that's why we need

258
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
arbitrary end and that's why we need
 

259
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,350
arbitrary end and that's why we need
uh you know this relative to input size

260
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
uh you know this relative to input size
 

261
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,469
uh you know this relative to input size
the growth factor of of our algorithm's

262
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
the growth factor of of our algorithm's
 

263
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,430
the growth factor of of our algorithm's
performance

264
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
performance
 

265
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,390
performance
relative to the input okay and then the

266
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
relative to the input okay and then the
 

267
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,029
relative to the input okay and then the
last thing

268
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
last thing
 

269
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,749
last thing
is kind of to me one of the most

270
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
is kind of to me one of the most
 

271
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,350
is kind of to me one of the most
important things

272
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
important things
 

273
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,830
important things
is communicating these things to another

274
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
is communicating these things to another
 

275
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,870
is communicating these things to another
human right

276
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
human right
 

277
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,590
human right
so communication

278
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600

 

279
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,469

is key here right if you can always

280
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
is key here right if you can always
 

281
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,189
is key here right if you can always
write good code that's always right

282
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
write good code that's always right
 

283
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,350
write good code that's always right
good for you i can't do that all the

284
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
good for you i can't do that all the
 

285
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,830
good for you i can't do that all the
time

286
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840

 

287
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,150

but that might mean that you can be very

288
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
but that might mean that you can be very
 

289
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,390
but that might mean that you can be very
a competent independent computer

290
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
a competent independent computer
 

291
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,590
a competent independent computer

293
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,710
programmer
right but you're going to be limited

294
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
right but you're going to be limited
 

295
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,990
right but you're going to be limited
in what you can do if you're uh

296
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
in what you can do if you're uh
 

297
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,110
in what you can do if you're uh
if you're only able to rely on yourself

298
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
if you're only able to rely on yourself
 

299
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,390
if you're only able to rely on yourself
right a lot about computer science

300
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
right a lot about computer science

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
you need to be able to communicate with
 

311
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,670
you need to be able to communicate with
them and you need to be able to

you're doing the correct thing and that
 

323
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,270
you're doing the correct thing and that
it's efficient right and so that's a big

but it's correct we're not going to give
you

340
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
you
 

341
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,909
you
full points on that because you're not

342
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
full points on that because you're not
 

343
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,029
full points on that because you're not
satisfying

344
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
satisfying
 

345
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,150
satisfying
the conditions of this class right it's

346
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
the conditions of this class right it's
 

347
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,469
the conditions of this class right it's
really about the communication here

348
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
really about the communication here
 

349
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,950
really about the communication here
okay so just to review since we've not

350
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
okay so just to review since we've not
 

351
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,990
okay so just to review since we've not
uh discussed uh how

352
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
uh discussed uh how
 

353
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,189
uh discussed uh how
the most recent lecture fits into

354
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
the most recent lecture fits into
 

355
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,350
the most recent lecture fits into
your problem sets we didn't have any

356
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
your problem sets we didn't have any
 

357
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,950
your problem sets we didn't have any
problem sets that covered

358
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
problem sets that covered
 

359
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,189
problem sets that covered
complexity so how does that fit in

360
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
complexity so how does that fit in
 

361
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,670
complexity so how does that fit in
well argue that this is that the ways

362
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
well argue that this is that the ways
 

363
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,749
well argue that this is that the ways
that we're solving our problems are good

364
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
that we're solving our problems are good
 

365
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,350
that we're solving our problems are good
what we proved in the last lecture was

366
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
what we proved in the last lecture was
 

367
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,350
what we proved in the last lecture was
that most problems cannot be solved good

368
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
that most problems cannot be solved good
 

369
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,909
that most problems cannot be solved good
right they can't be solved in polynomial

370
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
right they can't be solved in polynomial
 

371
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,550
right they can't be solved in polynomial
time

372
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560

373
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,110

377
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,909
however
most of the problems that we think about

378
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
most of the problems that we think about
 

379
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,749
most of the problems that we think about
in a sense i can i can prove to you that

i can prove to you that this is the
answer to this thing is correct

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
answer to this thing is correct
 

401
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,510
answer to this thing is correct
and that's what we talked about in the

402
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
and that's what we talked about in the
 

403
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,790
and that's what we talked about in the
last lecture what

last lecture what
 

405
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,150

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
so not always
 

407
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,430

fall into one of these two categories
 

455
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,310
fall into one of these two categories
right we can just brute force over the

456
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
right we can just brute force over the
 

457
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,470
right we can just brute force over the
combinatorial space of possible outputs

458
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
combinatorial space of possible outputs
 

459
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,870
combinatorial space of possible outputs
and check to see if they're correct

460
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
and check to see if they're correct
 

461
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,910
and check to see if they're correct
right or i can give you

462
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
right or i can give you
 

463
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,990
right or i can give you
a certificate basically saying uh

464
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
a certificate basically saying uh
 

465
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,990
a certificate basically saying uh
look i can solve actually anything

466
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
look i can solve actually anything
 

467
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,670
look i can solve actually anything
that's of this form can be checked in

468
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
that's of this form can be checked in
 

469
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,870
that's of this form can be checked in
this form because there's only a

470
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
this form because there's only a
 

471
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,949
this form because there's only a
polynomial number of things to check

472
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
polynomial number of things to check
 

473
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,110
polynomial number of things to check
or sorry an exponential possible number

474
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
or sorry an exponential possible number
 

475
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,190
or sorry an exponential possible number
of certificates of polynomial length to

476
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
of certificates of polynomial length to
 

477
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,069
of certificates of polynomial length to
check

478
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
check
 

479
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,630
check
um but basically this is saying that the

480
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
um but basically this is saying that the
 

481
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,389
um but basically this is saying that the
the problems that we think of

482
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
the problems that we think of
 

483
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,949
the problems that we think of
mostly fall into these two categories

484
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
mostly fall into these two categories
 

485
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,550
mostly fall into these two categories
and so there usually

486
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
and so there usually
 

487
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,630
and so there usually
are algorithms to solve the problems

488
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
are algorithms to solve the problems
 

489
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,230
are algorithms to solve the problems
that we care about

490
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240

 

491
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,670

even if most random problems

492
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
even if most random problems
 

493
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,230
even if most random problems
in terms of bit strings that we gave in

494
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
in terms of bit strings that we gave in
 

495
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,110
in terms of bit strings that we gave in
analysis

496
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
analysis
 

497
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,910
analysis
in the last lecture actually proved that

498
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
in the last lecture actually proved that
 

499
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,509
in the last lecture actually proved that
most random problems are not solvable

500
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
most random problems are not solvable
 

501
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,590
most random problems are not solvable
right though in a sense the problems we

502
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
right though in a sense the problems we
 

503
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,550
right though in a sense the problems we
think about

504
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
think about
 

505
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,710
think about
are not random they kind of have this

506
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
are not random they kind of have this
 

507
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,710
are not random they kind of have this
structure that they can be checked

508
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
structure that they can be checked
 

509
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,389
structure that they can be checked
pretty quickly okay so that's kind of

510
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
pretty quickly okay so that's kind of
 

511
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,269
pretty quickly okay so that's kind of
what we mean

512
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
what we mean
 

513
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,069
what we mean
when we're talking about complexity for

514
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
when we're talking about complexity for
 

515
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,670
when we're talking about complexity for
the purposes of the final

516
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
the purposes of the final
 

517
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,389
the purposes of the final
you'll be able to see on your final exam

518
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
you'll be able to see on your final exam
 

519
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,550
you'll be able to see on your final exam
uh practice

520
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
uh practice
 

521
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,310
uh practice
problems that we're going to give you

522
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
problems that we're going to give you
 

523
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,990
problems that we're going to give you
most of what we

524
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
most of what we
 

525
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,910
most of what we
uh cover uh in terms of

526
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
uh cover uh in terms of
 

527
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,150
uh cover uh in terms of
material on the final that will be cove

528
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
material on the final that will be cove
 

529
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,230
material on the final that will be cove
that will be testing the lecture 19

530
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
that will be testing the lecture 19
 

531
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,190
that will be testing the lecture 19
material

532
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
material
 

533
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,230
material
will be in terms of these definitions

534
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
will be in terms of these definitions
 

535
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,949
will be in terms of these definitions
do you understand what the the decision

536
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
do you understand what the the decision
 

537
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,910
do you understand what the the decision
problem class

538
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
problem class
 

539
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,269
problem class
np is x biz do you know

540
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
np is x biz do you know
 

541
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,670
np is x biz do you know
how these relate to each other x is

542
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
how these relate to each other x is
 

543
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,590
how these relate to each other x is
definitely a superset of

544
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
definitely a superset of
 

545
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,110
definitely a superset of
np here right np nestles inside here

546
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
np here right np nestles inside here
 

547
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,670
np here right np nestles inside here
they could be equal probably not right

548
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
they could be equal probably not right
 

549
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,750
they could be equal probably not right
those are the types of things that we

550
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
those are the types of things that we
 

551
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,389
those are the types of things that we
would address knowing kind of a

552
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
would address knowing kind of a
 

553
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,230
would address knowing kind of a
directionality of a reduction

554
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
directionality of a reduction
 

555
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,069
directionality of a reduction
right if you have a a problem

556
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
right if you have a a problem
 

557
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,590
right if you have a a problem
a and a problem b

558
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
a and a problem b
 

559
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,030
a and a problem b
right and i know that this one

560
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
right and i know that this one
 

561
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,550
right and i know that this one
is difficult by some measure

562
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
is difficult by some measure
 

563
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,590
is difficult by some measure
right i already happen to know that it's

564
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
right i already happen to know that it's
 

565
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,990
right i already happen to know that it's
you know very hard right like np hard or

566
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
you know very hard right like np hard or
 

567
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,430
you know very hard right like np hard or
something like that

568
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
something like that
 

569
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,509
something like that
if i can if if this is a problem that

570
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
if i can if if this is a problem that
 

571
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,350
if i can if if this is a problem that
i'm interested in knowing the complexity

572
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
i'm interested in knowing the complexity
 

573
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,470
i'm interested in knowing the complexity
about

574
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
about
 

575
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,509
about
and i can prove that i can solve it

576
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
and i can prove that i can solve it
 

577
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,590
and i can prove that i can solve it
if i had a black box to solve b

578
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
if i had a black box to solve b
 

579
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,750
if i had a black box to solve b
any black box to solve b and i could

580
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
any black box to solve b and i could
 

581
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,190
any black box to solve b and i could
make this reduction in polynomial time

582
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
make this reduction in polynomial time
 

583
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,310
make this reduction in polynomial time
and if this is hard that means this

584
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
and if this is hard that means this
 

585
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,590
and if this is hard that means this
can't be

586
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600

 

587
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,150

that means that if this is hard then i

588
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
that means that if this is hard then i
 

589
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,430
that means that if this is hard then i
better not be able to solve this in

590
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
better not be able to solve this in
 

591
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,269
better not be able to solve this in
polynomial time

592
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
polynomial time
 

593
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,790
polynomial time
right because then i would be able to

594
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
right because then i would be able to
 

595
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,710
right because then i would be able to
solve this in polynomial time so that's

596
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
solve this in polynomial time so that's
 

597
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,670
solve this in polynomial time so that's
basically

598
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
basically
 

599
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,710
basically
the type of argument usually in a true

600
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
the type of argument usually in a true
 

601
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,990
the type of argument usually in a true
false question we might have

602
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
false question we might have
 

603
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,949
false question we might have
on the final exam for you to kind of

604
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
on the final exam for you to kind of
 

605
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,790
on the final exam for you to kind of
understand the basic

606
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
understand the basic
 

607
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,350
understand the basic
high level definitions involved in what

608
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
high level definitions involved in what
 

609
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,829
high level definitions involved in what
was

610
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
was
 

611
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,110
was
talked about in lecture 19.

612
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
talked about in lecture 19.
 

613
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,069
talked about in lecture 19.
hardness right the very most difficult

614
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
hardness right the very most difficult
 

615
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,509
hardness right the very most difficult
problems of these classes

616
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
problems of these classes
 

617
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,310
problems of these classes
and completeness sorry uh anything

618
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
and completeness sorry uh anything
 

619
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,190
and completeness sorry uh anything
harder

620
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
harder
 

621
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,590
harder
than things in these classes where

622
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
than things in these classes where
 

623
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,030
than things in these classes where
completeness is the

624
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
completeness is the
 

625
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,269
completeness is the
ones that are in this set but at least

626
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
ones that are in this set but at least
 

627
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,030
ones that are in this set but at least
as hard as anything in those classes

628
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
as hard as anything in those classes
 

629
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,550
as hard as anything in those classes
okay so that's just to give you a brief

630
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
okay so that's just to give you a brief
 

631
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,269
okay so that's just to give you a brief
overview of the only material that

632
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
overview of the only material that
 

633
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,550
overview of the only material that
hasn't been tested

634
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
hasn't been tested
 

635
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,829
hasn't been tested
but might be tested on the final okay

636
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
but might be tested on the final okay
 

637
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,990
but might be tested on the final okay
so when we don't have a good algorithm

638
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
so when we don't have a good algorithm
 

639
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,670
so when we don't have a good algorithm
we can actually prove that it uh doesn't

640
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
we can actually prove that it uh doesn't
 

641
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,509
we can actually prove that it uh doesn't
might probably doesn't have a good

642
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
might probably doesn't have a good
 

643
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,190
might probably doesn't have a good
algorithm

644
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
algorithm
 

645
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,829
algorithm
and that's kind of a problem that you'll

646
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
and that's kind of a problem that you'll
 

647
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,110
and that's kind of a problem that you'll
be able to solve

648
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
be able to solve
 

649
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,190
be able to solve
in future classes if you continue along

650
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
in future classes if you continue along
 

651
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,230
in future classes if you continue along

this track
 

653
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,350
this track
okay so what's the actual content

okay so what's the actual content
 

655
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,189
okay so what's the actual content
that we talked about and this is a very

656
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
that we talked about and this is a very
 

657
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,110
that we talked about and this is a very
high level overview of why we're taking

658
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
high level overview of why we're taking
 

659
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,110
high level overview of why we're taking
this class why you're taking this class

660
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
this class why you're taking this class
 

661
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,629
this class why you're taking this class
right but what is the content we

662
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
right but what is the content we
 

663
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,470
right but what is the content we
actually covered it kind of

664
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
actually covered it kind of
 

665
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,910
actually covered it kind of
i like to break it up into three units

666
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
i like to break it up into three units
 

667
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,949
i like to break it up into three units
and kind of in a sense two

668
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
and kind of in a sense two
 

669
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,150
and kind of in a sense two
subunits okay so quiz one material

670
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
subunits okay so quiz one material
 

671
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,150
subunits okay so quiz one material
and quiz two material

672
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
and quiz two material
 

673
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,870
and quiz two material
was about showing you some nice black

674
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
was about showing you some nice black
 

675
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,829
was about showing you some nice black
boxes

676
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
boxes
 

677
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,990
boxes
right basically if i'm going to have

678
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
right basically if i'm going to have
 

679
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,150
right basically if i'm going to have
inputs of non-constant size

680
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
inputs of non-constant size
 

681
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,550
inputs of non-constant size
it's going to be useful for me to be

682
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
it's going to be useful for me to be
 

683
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,509
it's going to be useful for me to be
able to find

684
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
able to find
 

685
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,069
able to find
things among those elements right so

686
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
things among those elements right so
 

687
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,269
things among those elements right so
that's really what

688
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
that's really what
 

689
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,150
that's really what
quiz 1 is all about right data

690
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
quiz 1 is all about right data
 

691
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,269
quiz 1 is all about right data

692
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279

 

693
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,829

for finding

694
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

695
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,670

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
things in
 

697
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,670
things in
a non-constant

700
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720

701
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,550

uh database

702
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560

 

703
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,629

sure and when we were storing these

704
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
sure and when we were storing these
 

705
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,030
sure and when we were storing these
things we want to support maybe two

706
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
things we want to support maybe two
 

707
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,430
things we want to support maybe two
different types of queries

708
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
different types of queries
 

709
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,910
different types of queries
ones that were intrinsic to the items

710
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
ones that were intrinsic to the items
 

711
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,829
ones that were intrinsic to the items
what the items were

712
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
what the items were
 

713
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,710
what the items were
and ones based on what an extrinsic

714
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
and ones based on what an extrinsic
 

715
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,430
and ones based on what an extrinsic
order was placed on these items

716
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
order was placed on these items
 

717
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,069
order was placed on these items
right and that was a way in which we

718
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
right and that was a way in which we
 

719
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,269
right and that was a way in which we
broke down

720
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
broke down
 

721
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,629
broke down
how should i approach looking at this

722
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
how should i approach looking at this
 

723
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,310
how should i approach looking at this
problem i want to be able to support

724
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
problem i want to be able to support
 

725
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,110
problem i want to be able to support
queries

726
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
queries
 

727
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,509
queries
and maintain an extrinsic order on these

728
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
and maintain an extrinsic order on these
 

729
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,670
and maintain an extrinsic order on these
things i might want to sequence

730
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
things i might want to sequence
 

731
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,069
things i might want to sequence
right this is a sequence

732
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:27,079
right this is a sequence
 

733
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,949
right this is a sequence
extrinsic order

734
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959

 

735
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,870

or i want to be able to look up

736
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
or i want to be able to look up
 

737
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,670
or i want to be able to look up
is this thing in my set right by by a

738
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
is this thing in my set right by by a
 

739
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,150
is this thing in my set right by by a
key

740
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
key
 

741
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,710
key
that we identify it with a unique key

742
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
that we identify it with a unique key
 

743
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,509
that we identify it with a unique key
right

744
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
right
 

745
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,389
right
so this is some intrinsic

746
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399

 

747
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,870

queries and often order

748
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880

 

749
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,509

right not all like a hash table doesn't

750
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
right not all like a hash table doesn't
 

751
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,069
right not all like a hash table doesn't
maintain any order on my keys

752
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
maintain any order on my keys
 

753
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,310
maintain any order on my keys
right but it does support intrinsic

754
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
right but it does support intrinsic
 

755
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,710
right but it does support intrinsic
queries is this thing in my set or not

756
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
queries is this thing in my set or not
 

757
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,550
queries is this thing in my set or not
but we did show you other set data

758
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
but we did show you other set data
 

759
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,550
but we did show you other set data
structures that do support a

760
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
structures that do support a
 

761
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,870
structures that do support a
intrinsic order that allows me to see

762
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
intrinsic order that allows me to see
 

763
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,990
intrinsic order that allows me to see
what the next larger and next previous

764
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
what the next larger and next previous
 

765
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,590
what the next larger and next previous
uh the the the next larger the next

766
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
uh the the the next larger the next
 

767
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,150
uh the the the next larger the next
smaller

768
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
smaller
 

769
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,670
smaller
item is in my set

770
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
item is in my set
 

771
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,269
item is in my set
right so here's a summary of those

00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
right so here's a summary of those
 

773
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,269
right so here's a summary of those
data structures that we had i'm not

774
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
data structures that we had i'm not
 

775
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,710
data structures that we had i'm not

776
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
going to go into

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,550
going to go into
how to use these things or how to choose

here that's what your uh quiz 1 review

782
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
here that's what your uh quiz 1 review
 

783
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,550
here that's what your uh quiz 1 review
lecture was all about right

784
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
lecture was all about right
 

785
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,949
lecture was all about right
but basically the idea here is if we

786
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
but basically the idea here is if we
 

787
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,550
but basically the idea here is if we
have a sequence

788
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
have a sequence
 

789
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,990
have a sequence
most of the time when you're programming

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
most of the time when you're programming

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,150
most of the time when you're programming

807
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,350
things
have random access to uh

808
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
have random access to uh

the say 10th element to my thing

810
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
the say 10th element to my thing
 

811
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,230
the say 10th element to my thing
but i'm not necessarily having to

812
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
but i'm not necessarily having to
 

813
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,949
but i'm not necessarily having to
dynamically update

814
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
dynamically update
 

815
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,470
dynamically update
the order of these things in

816
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
the order of these things in
 

817
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,990
the order of these things in
dynamically i don't necessarily have to

818
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
dynamically i don't necessarily have to
 

819
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,990
dynamically i don't necessarily have to
insert something in the middle of the

820
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
insert something in the middle of the
 

821
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,710
insert something in the middle of the
list

822
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
list
 

823
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,429
list
most of the time what i can do is put it

824
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
most of the time what i can do is put it
 

825
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,470
most of the time what i can do is put it
at the end of the list

826
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
at the end of the list
 

827
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,549
at the end of the list
and maybe swap it down into place if i

828
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
and maybe swap it down into place if i
 

829
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,309
and maybe swap it down into place if i
need to right

830
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
need to right
 

831
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,870
need to right
so that's why a list is super useful a

832
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
so that's why a list is super useful a
 

833
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,029
so that's why a list is super useful a

i meant python list which is a dynamic

844
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
i meant python list which is a dynamic
 

845
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,150
i meant python list which is a dynamic

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
okay so the dynamic array tended to be

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,470
okay so the dynamic array tended to be

i kind of categorize these things into a
 

865
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,510
i kind of categorize these things into a
couple different categories here in

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
couple different categories here in
 

867
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,110

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
inserting deleting things i think of the
 

875
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,750
inserting deleting things i think of the
first three

876
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
first three
 

877
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,630
first three
as being dictionary operations right i

878
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
as being dictionary operations right i
 

879
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,150
as being dictionary operations right i
want to just look

880
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
want to just look
 

881
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,549

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
look up whether something's there
 

883
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,710
look up whether something's there
whereas the last two

884
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
whereas the last two
 

885
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,870
whereas the last two
are order preserving operations where

886
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
are order preserving operations where
 

887
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,870
are order preserving operations where
it matters what the order these things

888
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
it matters what the order these things
 

889
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,990
it matters what the order these things
are stored in

890
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
are stored in
 

891
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,350
are stored in
and so as you can see

892
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
and so as you can see
 

893
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,830
and so as you can see
from the uh you know asymptotic

894
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
from the uh you know asymptotic

but in the cases where you need to
 

909
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,310
but in the cases where you need to
maintain order dynamically

910
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
maintain order dynamically
 

911
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,430

a set avl is the way to go right

912
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
a set avl is the way to go right
 

913
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,110
a set avl is the way to go right
but if you don't need it dynamic but you

914
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
but if you don't need it dynamic but you
 

915
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,870
but if you don't need it dynamic but you
still need those order operations

916
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
still need those order operations
 

917
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,950
still need those order operations
a sorted array is just good enough if

1024
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
okay now you know how to find things
 

1025
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,310
okay now you know how to find things
within a

1026
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
within a
 

1027
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,390
within a
set of of just a flat list of things

1028
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
set of of just a flat list of things
 

1029
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,230
set of of just a flat list of things
right you can put it in a data structure

1030
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
right you can put it in a data structure
 

1031
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,710
right you can put it in a data structure
but in a sense a graph is a special kind

1032
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
but in a sense a graph is a special kind
 

1033
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,310
but in a sense a graph is a special kind
of data structure

1034
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
of data structure
 

1035
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,630
of data structure
right that relates the different things

1036
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
right that relates the different things
 

1037
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,990
right that relates the different things
in your input

1038
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
in your input
 

1039
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,510
in your input
right so uh if you've got

1040
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
right so uh if you've got
 

1041
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,230
right so uh if you've got
um a bunch of vertices right there's a

1042
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
um a bunch of vertices right there's a
 

1043
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,950
um a bunch of vertices right there's a
relation now between those vertices

1044
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:16,960
relation now between those vertices
 

1045
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,190
relation now between those vertices
that are your edges and this is a super

1046
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
that are your edges and this is a super
 

1047
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,549
that are your edges and this is a super
useful framework

1048
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
useful framework
 

1049
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,870
useful framework
in talking about discrete systems

1050
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
in talking about discrete systems
 

1051
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,190
in talking about discrete systems
because you can think of a vertex as a

1052
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
because you can think of a vertex as a
 

1053
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,110
because you can think of a vertex as a
state of your system

1054
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
state of your system
 

1055
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,270
state of your system
and then connect these transitions as a

1056
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
and then connect these transitions as a
 

1057
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,710
and then connect these transitions as a
graph right that's

1058
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
graph right that's
 

1059
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,230
graph right that's
that's the reason why i mean graphs are

1060
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
that's the reason why i mean graphs are
 

1061
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,230
that's the reason why i mean graphs are
awesome right but they're awesome

1062
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
awesome right but they're awesome
 

1063
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,149
awesome right but they're awesome
because they can be used to model so

1064
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
because they can be used to model so
 

1065
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,230
because they can be used to model so
many different things within our world

1066
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
many different things within our world
 

1067
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,029
many different things within our world
right it's not just about you know road

1068
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
right it's not just about you know road
 

1069
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,070
right it's not just about you know road
networks

1070
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
networks
 

1071
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,310
networks
right it can also be about playing your

1072
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
right it can also be about playing your
 

1073
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,750
right it can also be about playing your
favorite

1074
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
favorite
 

1075
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,590
favorite
uh turn-based game right like tilt right

1076
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
uh turn-based game right like tilt right
 

1077
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,310
uh turn-based game right like tilt right
okay so uh we we talked about a lot of

1078
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
okay so uh we we talked about a lot of
 

1079
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,510
okay so uh we we talked about a lot of
different types of problems that you

1080
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
different types of problems that you
 

1081
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,230
different types of problems that you
could solve

1082
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
could solve
 

1083
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,350
could solve
various algorithms with a focus on a

1084
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
various algorithms with a focus on a
 

1085
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,270
various algorithms with a focus on a
bunch of different ways of solving

1086
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
bunch of different ways of solving
 

1087
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,149
bunch of different ways of solving
single source shortest paths and again

1088
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
single source shortest paths and again
 

1089
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,750
single source shortest paths and again
just like the sorting algorithms and

1090
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
just like the sorting algorithms and
 

1091
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,029
just like the sorting algorithms and
just like the data structures we

1092
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
just like the data structures we
 

1093
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,990
just like the data structures we
presented

1094
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000
presented
 

1095
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,270
presented
multiple of them because we had this

1096
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
multiple of them because we had this
 

1097
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,149
multiple of them because we had this
trade-off of

1098
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
trade-off of
 

1099
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,870
trade-off of
generality of the graph that they apply

1100
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
generality of the graph that they apply
 

1101
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,870
generality of the graph that they apply
to

1102
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
to
 

1103
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,190
to
contrasted with their running time right

1104
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
contrasted with their running time right
 

1105
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,909
contrasted with their running time right
so

1106
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
so
 

1107
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,669
so
i guess in in particular the the the top

1108
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
i guess in in particular the the the top
 

1109
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,270
i guess in in particular the the the top
um uh line there is

1110
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,280
um uh line there is
 

1111
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,070
um uh line there is
in some sense the most restrictive we we

1112
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
in some sense the most restrictive we we
 

1113
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,430
in some sense the most restrictive we we
don't have any cycles in our graph

1114
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
don't have any cycles in our graph
 

1115
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,870
don't have any cycles in our graph
that's a very special type of graph and

1116
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
that's a very special type of graph and
 

1117
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,909
that's a very special type of graph and
we're able to get linear time

1118
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
we're able to get linear time
 

1119
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,590
we're able to get linear time
but then even if we do have cycles in

1120
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
but then even if we do have cycles in
 

1121
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,430
but then even if we do have cycles in
our graph we can do better

1122
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
our graph we can do better
 

1123
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,149
our graph we can do better
if we have a bound on the weights in our

1124
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:42,159
if we have a bound on the weights in our
 

1125
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,750
if we have a bound on the weights in our
in our thing whether they

1126
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
in our thing whether they
 

1127
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,630
in our thing whether they
be uh there's an easy conversion to a

1128
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
be uh there's an easy conversion to a
 

1129
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,310
be uh there's an easy conversion to a
linear time algorithm via

1130
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
linear time algorithm via
 

1131
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,630
linear time algorithm via
an unweighted process or whether these

1132
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
an unweighted process or whether these
 

1133
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,310
an unweighted process or whether these
things are non-negative so there can't

1134
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
things are non-negative so there can't
 

1135
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,669
things are non-negative so there can't
be negative weight cycles and we don't

1136
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
be negative weight cycles and we don't
 

1137
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,950
be negative weight cycles and we don't
have to deal with that

1138
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
have to deal with that
 

1139
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,870
have to deal with that
okay so that's quiz two material

1140
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
okay so that's quiz two material
 

1141
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,630
okay so that's quiz two material
and then quiz three material was kind of

1142
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
and then quiz three material was kind of
 

1143
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,230
and then quiz three material was kind of
applying this graph material

1144
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
applying this graph material
 

1145
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,149
applying this graph material
to a recursive framework what was our

1146
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
to a recursive framework what was our
 

1147
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,350
to a recursive framework what was our
recursive framework

1148
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
recursive framework
 

1149
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,990
recursive framework
everyone say it with me dynamic

1150
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
everyone say it with me dynamic
 

1151
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,510
everyone say it with me dynamic
programming and the framework was

1152
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
programming and the framework was
 

1153
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,110
programming and the framework was
sort bot right missing a letter but sort

1154
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
sort bot right missing a letter but sort
 

1155
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,510
sort bot right missing a letter but sort

1156
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
bot
 

1157
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,710
bot
right you can actually think of

1158
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
right you can actually think of
 

1159
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,990
right you can actually think of
the quiz 3 material as

1160
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
the quiz 3 material as
 

1161
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,549
the quiz 3 material as
uh as really an application of the graph

1162
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
uh as really an application of the graph
 

1163
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,510
uh as really an application of the graph

1164
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
material
 

1165
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,789
material
right what what are we doing in sort bot

1166
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
right what what are we doing in sort bot
 

1167
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,149
right what what are we doing in sort bot
we're defining a set of sub problems

1168
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
we're defining a set of sub problems
 

1169
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,190
we're defining a set of sub problems
this is a set of vertices in a graph

what is the relationship doing it's

1172
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
what is the relationship doing it's
 

1173
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,710
what is the relationship doing it's
saying

1174
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
saying
 

1175
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,669
saying
what are the relation between the

1176
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
what are the relation between the
 

1177
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,549
what are the relation between the
sub-problems

1178
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:44,559
sub-problems
 

1179
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,549
sub-problems
right essentially defining the edges of

1180
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
right essentially defining the edges of
 

1181
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,909
right essentially defining the edges of
a graph

a graph
right and then this topological order

1184
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
right and then this topological order
 

1185
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,470
right and then this topological order
and the base cases

1186
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
and the base cases
 

1187
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,630
and the base cases
all of these things are just saying what

1188
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
all of these things are just saying what
 

1189
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,149
all of these things are just saying what
is the problem that i want to solve on

1190
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
is the problem that i want to solve on
 

1191
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,110
is the problem that i want to solve on
this graph

1192
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
this graph
 

1193
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,390
this graph
and how do i uh compute that

1194
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
and how do i uh compute that
 

1195
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,470
and how do i uh compute that
for things that don't have any outgoing

1196
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
for things that don't have any outgoing
 

1197
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,549
for things that don't have any outgoing
edges right

1198
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
edges right
 

1199
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,789
edges right
i need to start writing the board again

1200
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
i need to start writing the board again
 

1201
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,430
i need to start writing the board again
this is graphs

1202
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
this is graphs
 

1203
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,789
this is graphs
there was a sorting in here too

1204
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
there was a sorting in here too
 

1205
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,950
there was a sorting in here too
this is basically an application

1206
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960

 

1207
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,230

okay graphs was basically a relationship

1208
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
okay graphs was basically a relationship
 

1209
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,269
okay graphs was basically a relationship
on these

1210
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
on these
 

1211
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,990
on these
non-constant things

1212
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,000

 

1213
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,750

so this was kind of like useful black

1214
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
so this was kind of like useful black
 

1215
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,269
so this was kind of like useful black
boxes

1216
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
boxes
 

1217
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,549

1225
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,590

things i think
 

1263
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,269
things i think
because there's a lot more creativity in

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
especially when
 

1359
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,990
especially when
instead of looking at all possible

1360
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
instead of looking at all possible
 

1361
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,669
instead of looking at all possible
choices

choices
 

1363
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,590
choices
for example in a greedy algorithm where

1364
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
for example in a greedy algorithm where
 

1365
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,190
for example in a greedy algorithm where
you're just looking at one of the

1366
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
you're just looking at one of the
 

1367
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,750
you're just looking at one of the
choices

1368
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
choices
 

1369
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,310

you're not doing all the work right

1374
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
you're not doing all the work right
 

1375
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,029
you're not doing all the work right
you're not locally brute forcing you're

1376
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
you're not locally brute forcing you're
 

1377
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,710
you're not locally brute forcing you're
locally picking

1378
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:34,720
locally picking
 

1379
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,870
locally picking
an optimal thing locally and hoping that

1380
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:36,880
an optimal thing locally and hoping that
 

1381
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,389
an optimal thing locally and hoping that
it'll lead you to good thing

1382
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:38,399
it'll lead you to good thing
 

1383
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,630
it'll lead you to good thing
that's a much harder algorithmic

1384
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
that's a much harder algorithmic
 

1385
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,669
that's a much harder algorithmic
paradigm

1386
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
paradigm
 

1387
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,590
paradigm
to uh to operate under and so that's

1388
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
to uh to operate under and so that's
 

1389
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,350
to uh to operate under and so that's
more like the material that you'll be

1390
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
more like the material that you'll be
 

1391
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,350
more like the material that you'll be
talking about in 6046

1392
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
talking about in 6046
 

1393
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,269
talking about in 6046
okay so uh that's

1394
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
okay so uh that's
 

1395
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,549
okay so uh that's

and efficient right that's

1418
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
and efficient right that's
 

1419
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,549

really what this problems this this this
 

1421
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,510
really what this problems this this this
course is about

1423
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,870

and if you feel like you

1424
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
and if you feel like you
 

1425
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,870
and if you feel like you
enjoy this kind of stuff that's where

1426
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
enjoy this kind of stuff that's where
 

1427
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,070
enjoy this kind of stuff that's where
you go to take

1428
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
you go to take
 

1429
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,190
you go to take
6046 right and 6046 was actually

1430
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
6046 right and 6046 was actually
 

1431
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,149
6046 right and 6046 was actually
the first algorithms class i ever took

1432
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
the first algorithms class i ever took
 

1433
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,750
the first algorithms class i ever took
here at mit

1434
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:41,760
here at mit
 

1435
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,750
here at mit
uh as a grad student actually i uh

1436
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
uh as a grad student actually i uh
 

1437
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,310
uh as a grad student actually i uh
i didn't this is this is hard for me

1438
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
i didn't this is this is hard for me
 

1439
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,789
i didn't this is this is hard for me
right

1440
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799
right
 

1441
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,269
right
it was it's actually hard to look at

1442
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
it was it's actually hard to look at
 

1443
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,549
it was it's actually hard to look at
these problems

1444
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:52,559
these problems
 

1445
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,710
these problems
these types and think in a computational

1446
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
these types and think in a computational
 

1447
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,230
these types and think in a computational
way especially

1448
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,240
way especially
 

1449
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,269
way especially
having not taken this class 6006.

1450
00:28:59,269 --> 00:28:59,279
having not taken this class 6006.
 

1451
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,710
having not taken this class 6006.
so hopefully you guys are all in a

1452
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
so hopefully you guys are all in a
 

1453
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,110
so hopefully you guys are all in a
better position uh than i was when i

1454
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120
better position uh than i was when i
 

1455
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,310
better position uh than i was when i
took it

1456
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,320
took it
 

1457
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,310
took it
there's there's two ways i like to think

1458
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,320
there's there's two ways i like to think
 

1459
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,190
there's there's two ways i like to think
of the content in 6046

1460
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
of the content in 6046
 

1461
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,350
of the content in 6046
one is kind of just as an extension of

1462
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
one is kind of just as an extension of
 

1463
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,710
one is kind of just as an extension of
double06 right

1464
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
double06 right
 

1465
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,630
double06 right
it's the natural follow-on to the things

1466
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
it's the natural follow-on to the things
 

1467
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,990
it's the natural follow-on to the things
that we do in this class

1468
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,000
that we do in this class
 

1469
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,990
that we do in this class
right they still talk about data

1470
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
right they still talk about data
 

1471
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,870
right they still talk about data
structures

1472
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880

 

1473
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,389

this isn't the core part of 046 but they

1474
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
this isn't the core part of 046 but they
 

1475
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:26,950
this isn't the core part of 046 but they
do touch

1476
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
do touch
 

1477
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,909
do touch
on data structures for more complicated

1478
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:29,919
on data structures for more complicated
 

1479
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,029
on data structures for more complicated
uh

1480
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039
uh
 

1481
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,950
uh
that have more complicated analysis

1482
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
that have more complicated analysis
 

1483
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,430
that have more complicated analysis
involved in them it's really about

1484
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,440
involved in them it's really about
 

1485
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,710
involved in them it's really about
you know usually in o46 stating what the

you know usually in o46 stating what the
 

1487

you know usually in o46 stating what the
algorithm is doing is not

1488

algorithm is doing is not
 

1489
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,750
algorithm is doing is not
so hard right basically

1490
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
so hard right basically
 

1491
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,990
so hard right basically
giving you the algorithm number one here

1492
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
giving you the algorithm number one here
 

1493
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,909
giving you the algorithm number one here
is not so difficult to state what's

1494
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:49,919
is not so difficult to state what's
 

1495
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,310
is not so difficult to state what's
happening in the algorithm

1496
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320
happening in the algorithm
 

1497
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,669
happening in the algorithm
but the number two and number three here

1498
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679
but the number two and number three here
 

1499
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,070
but the number two and number three here
arguing that that thing is correct and

that's where the complexity comes in in

1504
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
that's where the complexity comes in in
 

1505
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,430
that's where the complexity comes in in
o46

1506

1507
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,909
o46
the design the the analysis part is

1508
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:05,919
the design the the analysis part is
 

1509
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,990
the design the the analysis part is
quite a bit more complicated in o46

1510
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
quite a bit more complicated in o46
 

1511
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,830
quite a bit more complicated in o46
than in 006 right so they

1512
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:11,840
than in 006 right so they
 

1513
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,750
than in 006 right so they
they solve a problem called union find

1514
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
they solve a problem called union find
 

1515
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,310
they solve a problem called union find
and give a much we talked a little bit

1516
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
and give a much we talked a little bit
 

1517
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,630
and give a much we talked a little bit
about amortization this goes into a much

1518
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
about amortization this goes into a much
 

1519
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,029
about amortization this goes into a much
better

1520
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
better
 

1521
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,230
better
a much more formal way of proving

1522
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
a much more formal way of proving
 

1523
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,590
a much more formal way of proving
things uh uh run in

1524
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
things uh uh run in
 

1525
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,830
things uh uh run in
amortized time okay so this is basically

1526
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:34,840

 

1527
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,110

amortization

1528
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,120
amortization
 

1529
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:45,909
amortization
the uh what we call a potential analysis

1530
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:45,919

 

1531
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,830

it's basically making that algo that

1532
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
it's basically making that algo that
 

1533
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,710
it's basically making that algo that
that that that uh

1534
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:50,720
that that that uh
 

1535
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,310
that that that uh
that notion that we talked about when we

1536
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
that notion that we talked about when we
 

1537
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,230
that notion that we talked about when we
were talking about dynamic arrays of

1538
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
were talking about dynamic arrays of
 

1539
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,789
were talking about dynamic arrays of
you know we're not doing this expensive

1540
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:56,799
you know we're not doing this expensive
 

1541
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,230
you know we're not doing this expensive
thing too often

1542
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
thing too often
 

1543
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,149
thing too often
basically what we do is we keep track of

1544
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
basically what we do is we keep track of
 

1545
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,070
basically what we do is we keep track of
the cost of all of uh sequence of

1546
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
the cost of all of uh sequence of
 

1547
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,029
the cost of all of uh sequence of
operations

1548
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,039
operations
 

1549
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,389
operations
and prove that the average cost is small

1550
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:06,399
and prove that the average cost is small
 

1551
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,389
and prove that the average cost is small
right that's that's kind of what this

1552
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
right that's that's kind of what this
 

1553
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,310
right that's that's kind of what this
potential analysis is doing it's a

1554
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
potential analysis is doing it's a
 

1555
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,750
potential analysis is doing it's a
little bit more formal process for

1556
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
little bit more formal process for
 

1557
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,190
little bit more formal process for
making that argument

1558
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
making that argument
 

1559
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,630
making that argument
uh a little uh more formal right okay

1560
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
uh a little uh more formal right okay
 

1561
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,110
uh a little uh more formal right okay
so then on on the graph side right this

1562
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,120
so then on on the graph side right this
 

1563
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,990
so then on on the graph side right this
is kind of

1564
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000
is kind of
 

1565
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,310
is kind of
an extension of quiz one type material

1566
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
an extension of quiz one type material
 

1567
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,029
an extension of quiz one type material
this is

1568
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,039
this is
 

1569
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,710
this is
what what is this union find data

1570
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:24,720
what what is this union find data
 

1571
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,149
what what is this union find data
structure it's basically

1572
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
structure it's basically
 

1573
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,750
structure it's basically
it's a set type thing right

1574
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
it's a set type thing right
 

1575
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,630
it's a set type thing right
where i i can make a set

1576
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
where i i can make a set
 

1577
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,149
where i i can make a set
of just a single element i can

1578
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
of just a single element i can
 

1579
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,350
of just a single element i can
take two sets merge them together

1580
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
take two sets merge them together
 

1581
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,269
take two sets merge them together
make them their union right and then

1582
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
make them their union right and then
 

1583
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,470
make them their union right and then
given an object i i say which set am i

1584
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
given an object i i say which set am i
 

1585
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,909
given an object i i say which set am i
part of

1586
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:49,919
part of
 

1587
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,230
part of
right essentially by electing a leader

1588
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,240
right essentially by electing a leader
 

1589
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,190
right essentially by electing a leader
within a set

1590
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,200
within a set
 

1591
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,430
within a set
and saying return me uh you know a

1592
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
and saying return me uh you know a
 

1593
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,710
and saying return me uh you know a
pointer to that one

1594
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
pointer to that one
 

1595
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,830
pointer to that one
right and so this can be useful in

1596
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:58,840
right and so this can be useful in
 

1597
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,950
right and so this can be useful in
dynamically maintaining say the

1598
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
dynamically maintaining say the
 

1599
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,630
dynamically maintaining say the
connected components in a

1600
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:02,640
connected components in a
 

1601
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,669
connected components in a
dynamically changing graph

1602
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
dynamically changing graph
 

1603
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,630
dynamically changing graph
supporting the query of am i in the same

1604
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,640
supporting the query of am i in the same
 

1605
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,710
supporting the query of am i in the same
component and as this other guy

1606
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720
component and as this other guy
 

1607
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,549
component and as this other guy
right that could be a very useful thing

1608
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
right that could be a very useful thing
 

1609
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,630
right that could be a very useful thing
to know about a graph as it's changing

1610
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:14,640
to know about a graph as it's changing
 

1611
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,190
to know about a graph as it's changing
so that's

1612
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
so that's
 

1613
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,029
so that's
that's an application of this problem

1614
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
that's an application of this problem
 

1615
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,310
that's an application of this problem
and they get

1616
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,320
and they get
 

1617
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,710
and they get
near constant performance for a lot of

1618
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
near constant performance for a lot of
 

1619
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,830
near constant performance for a lot of
these these queries

1620
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:21,840
these these queries
 

1621
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,190
these these queries
it's not quite but you know pretty close

1622
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,200
it's not quite but you know pretty close
 

1623
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,269
it's not quite but you know pretty close
okay on the graph side they solve a

1624
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:27,279
okay on the graph side they solve a
 

1625
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,470
okay on the graph side they solve a
number of uh

1626
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
number of uh
 

1627
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,230
number of uh
very useful problems on graphs uh

1628
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,240
very useful problems on graphs uh
 

1629
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,590
very useful problems on graphs uh
minimum spanning tree so i'm i'm trying

a tree connecting all of the vertices in
a connected component of my graph

1636
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,080
a connected component of my graph
 

1637
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,669
a connected component of my graph
and i'm trying to find in a weighted

1638
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:43,679
and i'm trying to find in a weighted
 

1639
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,350
and i'm trying to find in a weighted

1657
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,110

uh and i guess cuts right so this is

1658
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
uh and i guess cuts right so this is
 

1659
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,269
uh and i guess cuts right so this is
what is this this is i'm given a

1660
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
what is this this is i'm given a
 

1661

uh basically each of the um
 

1665
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,029
uh basically each of the um
the weights correspond to a capacity i

1666
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:21,039
the weights correspond to a capacity i
 

1667

right and i want to say i want to shove

1674
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
right and i want to say i want to shove
 

1675
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,230
right and i want to say i want to shove
water through the source vertex

1676

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,669
water through the source vertex
along the edges with their various

1678
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:36,679
along the edges with their various
 

1679
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:38,389
along the edges with their various
capacities and

1680
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
capacities and
 

1681
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,230
capacities and
i'll get some amount of water on the

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,240
i'll get some amount of water on the
 

1683
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,830
i'll get some amount of water on the
other end in the source

other end in the source
 

1685
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,750
other end in the source
right so the question is what's the most

1686
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:45,760
right so the question is what's the most
 

1687
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,190
right so the question is what's the most
amount of water that i can push through

amount of water that i can push through
 

1689
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,269
amount of water that i can push through
this well i could build

1690
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:49,279
this well i could build
 

1691
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,950
this well i could build
build that pipe network with the

1692
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
build that pipe network with the
 

1693
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,230
build that pipe network with the
different things and just do this

1694
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
different things and just do this
 

1695
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,269
different things and just do this
experimentally i just

1696
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:53,279
experimentally i just
 

1697
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,750
experimentally i just
stick a bunch of maybe i i'm a

1698
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:55,760
stick a bunch of maybe i i'm a
 

1699
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,509
stick a bunch of maybe i i'm a
mechanical engineer so that that maybe

1700
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:57,519
mechanical engineer so that that maybe
 

1701
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,110
mechanical engineer so that that maybe
makes sense to me but

1702
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
makes sense to me but
 

1703
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,389
makes sense to me but
you want to be able to just look at

1704
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:00,399
you want to be able to just look at
 

1705
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,230
you want to be able to just look at
those numbers and be able to tell me

1706
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
those numbers and be able to tell me
 

1707
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,310
those numbers and be able to tell me
how much water can i push through that's

1708
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,320
how much water can i push through that's
 

1709
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,590
how much water can i push through that's
what the kind of

1710
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,600
what the kind of
 

1711
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,629
what the kind of
max flow in the network is talking about

1712
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
max flow in the network is talking about
 

1713
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,149
max flow in the network is talking about
and we give you some polynomial time

1714
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
and we give you some polynomial time
 

1715
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,909
and we give you some polynomial time
algorithms in this class

1716
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:11,919
algorithms in this class
 

1717
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,230
algorithms in this class
basically incremental algorithms that

1718
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,240
basically incremental algorithms that
 

1719
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,950
basically incremental algorithms that
kind of like

1720
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
kind of like
 

1721
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,629
kind of like
dijkstra or kind of like bellman ford

1722
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
dijkstra or kind of like bellman ford
 

1723
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,069
dijkstra or kind of like bellman ford
will incrementally update uh

1724
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,079
will incrementally update uh
 

1725
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,190
will incrementally update uh
estimates to uh

1726
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,200
estimates to uh
 

1727
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,230
estimates to uh
of of a max flow and and improve them

1728
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,240
of of a max flow and and improve them
 

1729
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,109
of of a max flow and and improve them
over time

1730
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:29,119
over time
 

1731
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,710
over time
okay uh then

1732
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
okay uh then
 

1733
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:42,310
okay uh then
on the basically design paradigms

1734
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,320

 

1735
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,510

you've got more involved making your own

1736
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
you've got more involved making your own
 

1737
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,750
you've got more involved making your own
divide and conquer algorithms

1738
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:47,760
divide and conquer algorithms
 

1739
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,829
divide and conquer algorithms
you know dynamic programming algorithms

1740
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839

 

1741
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,349

greedy algorithms basically

1742
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
greedy algorithms basically
 

1743
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,430
greedy algorithms basically
they go a lot more in depth in terms of

1744
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,440
they go a lot more in depth in terms of
 

1745
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,349
they go a lot more in depth in terms of
how to design these algorithms in these

1746
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
how to design these algorithms in these
 

1747
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,150
how to design these algorithms in these
paradigms

1748
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,160
paradigms
 

1749
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,270
paradigms
than we do in this class okay and then

1750
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280
than we do in this class okay and then
 

1751
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,630
than we do in this class okay and then
the last thing

1752
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:08,640
the last thing
 

1753
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,990
the last thing
is we only touched on complexity

1754
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
is we only touched on complexity
 

1755
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,190
is we only touched on complexity
and in a sense 046 is only going to

1756
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,200
and in a sense 046 is only going to
 

1757
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,950
and in a sense 046 is only going to
touch on complexity it's a very big

1758
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:18,960
touch on complexity it's a very big
 

1759
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,990
touch on complexity it's a very big
field

1760
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
field
 

1761
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,670
field
right but it will give you the tools

1762
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
right but it will give you the tools
 

1763
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,750
right but it will give you the tools
to be able to prove that something is np

1764
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:25,760
to be able to prove that something is np
 

1765
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,950
to be able to prove that something is np
hard

1766
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
hard
 

1767
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,349
hard
whereas we just kind of say that oh

1768
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359
whereas we just kind of say that oh
 

1769
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,910
whereas we just kind of say that oh
there's this thing called reduction

1770
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
there's this thing called reduction
 

1771
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,349
there's this thing called reduction
we didn't give you any uh problems in

1772
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
we didn't give you any uh problems in
 

1773
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,109
we didn't give you any uh problems in
which you actually had to reduce one

1774
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
which you actually had to reduce one
 

1775
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,390
which you actually had to reduce one
problem to another

1776
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
problem to another
 

1777
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,829
problem to another
and you'll do a lot more of that here so

1778
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:42,839

 

1779
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,710

reductions so

1780
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:44,720
reductions so
 

1781
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,990
reductions so
in a in a big sense

1782
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,000
in a in a big sense
 

1783
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,470
in a in a big sense
oh four six is really just a natural

1784
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,480
oh four six is really just a natural
 

1785
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,310
oh four six is really just a natural
extension

1786
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
extension
 

1787
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,109
extension
to the double o six material plus some

1788
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:55,119
to the double o six material plus some
 

1789
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,710
to the double o six material plus some
additional stuff which i'm gonna get to

1790
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
additional stuff which i'm gonna get to
 

1791
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,470
additional stuff which i'm gonna get to
in a second yeah question

1792
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:58,480
in a second yeah question
 

1793
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,390
in a second yeah question
randomization uh i'm going to

1794
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
randomization uh i'm going to
 

1795
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,870
randomization uh i'm going to
talk about that slightly in a in a

1796
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
talk about that slightly in a in a
 

1797
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,589
talk about that slightly in a in a
separate uh

1798
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:05,599
separate uh
 

1799
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,030
separate uh
i'll get to your question in just a

1800
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,040
i'll get to your question in just a
 

1801
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,790
i'll get to your question in just a
second i like to think of it

1802
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:08,800
second i like to think of it
 

1803
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,990
second i like to think of it
as a separate topic which i'll we'll go

1804
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
as a separate topic which i'll we'll go
 

1805
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,550
as a separate topic which i'll we'll go
into right now the separate topic i like

1806
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:14,560
into right now the separate topic i like
 

1807
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,230
into right now the separate topic i like
to think of it as

1808
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
to think of it as
 

1809
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,310
to think of it as
instead of being the natural extension

1810
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
instead of being the natural extension
 

1811
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,910
instead of being the natural extension
to the things in

1812
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
to the things in
 

1813
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,950
to the things in
in the double 06 units

1814
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
in the double 06 units
 

1815
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,150
in the double 06 units
what i'm going to do is kind of

1816
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
what i'm going to do is kind of
 

1817
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,109
what i'm going to do is kind of
relax either what it means to have a

1818
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
relax either what it means to have a
 

1819
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,349
relax either what it means to have a
correct algorithm

1820
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:31,359
correct algorithm
 

1821
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,910
correct algorithm
or relax what it means to uh

1822
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:35,920
or relax what it means to uh
 

1823
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,109
or relax what it means to uh
what my model of computation is okay

1824
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
what my model of computation is okay
 

1825
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,829
what my model of computation is okay
so double o six this is kind of

1826
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
so double o six this is kind of
 

1827
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,510
so double o six this is kind of
as an extension

1828
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,520

 

1829
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,270

of double o six

1830
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,280
of double o six
 

1831
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,030
of double o six
and this is kind of like 6046

1832
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
and this is kind of like 6046
 

1833
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,430
and this is kind of like 6046
as you know

1834
00:36:59,430 --> 00:36:59,440

 

1835
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,870

change

1836
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880

 

1837
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,190

my definition of what it means to be

1838
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,200
my definition of what it means to be
 

1839
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,550
my definition of what it means to be
correct or efficient

1840
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560

 

1841
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,750

so

1842
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760

 

1843
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,589

we've already kind of done this a little

1844
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:15,599
we've already kind of done this a little
 

1845
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,510
we've already kind of done this a little
bit in double o six

1846
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:17,520
bit in double o six
 

1847
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,430
bit in double o six
um i'm gonna

1848
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:21,440

 

1849
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,109

basically one of the things that we can

1850
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:23,119
basically one of the things that we can
 

1851
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,790
basically one of the things that we can
do which is what the question that

1852
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:24,800
do which is what the question that
 

1853
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,589
do which is what the question that
uh student asked a question about was

1854
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:27,599
uh student asked a question about was
 

1855
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,510
uh student asked a question about was
about randomized algorithms which is a

1856
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520

the definition what we did was
 

1897
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,589

then then on in expectation right that's

1905
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,710

we meant there right we're relaxing the

1907
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,710

but we're still saying it's good because

but we're still saying it's good because
 

1911
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,310
but we're still saying it's good because
most of the time it is good

for some definition of efficient but

for some definition of efficient but
only probably correct

1961
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,190

and i mean i could define you a hash

1962
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
and i mean i could define you a hash
 

1963
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,310

monte carlo semantics instead right say

1966
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
monte carlo semantics instead right say
 

1967
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,109

00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:07,119
for example

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,270
for example
i i say that i'm gonna it's to be

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,829
exactly the same as a hash table
except instead of storing all the things

i just store the first two say

1978
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
i just store the first two say
 

1979
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,710
i just store the first two say
right well actually

1980
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
right well actually
 

1981
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,710
right well actually
that's actually going to be always

1982
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:24,720
that's actually going to be always
 

1983
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,910
that's actually going to be always
efficient i'm going to look through the

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:25,920
efficient i'm going to look through the
 

1985
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,030
efficient i'm going to look through the
things and see if it's in there

1986
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
things and see if it's in there
 

1987
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,790
things and see if it's in there
and the chan the chains that i'm storing

and the chan the chains that i'm storing
 

1989
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,550
and the chan the chains that i'm storing
there only have two things

1990
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,560
there only have two things
 

1991
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,910
there only have two things
it's going to be always efficient it's

1992
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:33,920
it's going to be always efficient it's
 

1993
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,829
it's going to be always efficient it's
always going to give me constant time

1994
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
always going to give me constant time
 

1995
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,829
always going to give me constant time
but some of the time it's going to be

1996
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
but some of the time it's going to be
 

1997
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,430
but some of the time it's going to be
the wrong thing because i'm not storing

1998
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,440
the wrong thing because i'm not storing
 

1999
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,030
the wrong thing because i'm not storing
everything in that chain

2000
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040
everything in that chain
 

2001
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,870
everything in that chain
right so there's some probability that

2002
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:42,880
right so there's some probability that
 

2003
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,630
right so there's some probability that
that's not going to be correct

2004
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
that's not going to be correct
 

2005
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,470
that's not going to be correct
right and so that's that's a different

2006
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
right and so that's that's a different
 

2007
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,190
right and so that's that's a different
kind of if maybe i want my hash tables

2008
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
kind of if maybe i want my hash tables
 

2009
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,150
kind of if maybe i want my hash tables
to always be fast

2010
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,160
to always be fast
 

2011
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,349
to always be fast
but i can afford to be wrong some of the

2012
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:53,359
but i can afford to be wrong some of the
 

2013
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,309
but i can afford to be wrong some of the

2014
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:54,319

2015
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,670

i don't know in practice this is

i don't know in practice this is
 

2017
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,829
i don't know in practice this is
actually sometimes a good trade-off

2018
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:57,839
actually sometimes a good trade-off
 

2019
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,870
actually sometimes a good trade-off
in real systems sometimes it's okay to

2020
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
in real systems sometimes it's okay to
 

2021
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,309
in real systems sometimes it's okay to
be wrong some of the times

2022
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
be wrong some of the times
 

2023
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,630
be wrong some of the times
if we get good performance okay

2024
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
if we get good performance okay
 

2025
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,910
if we get good performance okay
so but generally

2026
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920

 

2027
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,190

can do better

2028
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,200

 

2029
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,710

uh if you allow

2030
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
uh if you allow
 

2031
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,829
uh if you allow
randomization and by better i mean

2032
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:25,839
randomization and by better i mean
 

2033
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,670
randomization and by better i mean
you know usually we can get faster

2034
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
you know usually we can get faster
 

2035
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,430
you know usually we can get faster
bounds on a lot of problems

2036
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,440
bounds on a lot of problems
 

2037
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,390
bounds on a lot of problems
if we allow randomization and things

2038
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,400
if we allow randomization and things
 

2039
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,990
if we allow randomization and things
aren't necessarily always correct

2040
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,000
aren't necessarily always correct
 

2041
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,109
aren't necessarily always correct
or always efficient okay so

2042
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:37,119
or always efficient okay so
 

2043
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,030
or always efficient okay so
this is a big area in 0 4 6

2044
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,040
this is a big area in 0 4 6
 

2045
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,910
this is a big area in 0 4 6
that requires a lot more analysis using

2046
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
that requires a lot more analysis using
 

2047
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,630
that requires a lot more analysis using
randomness and probability so if you're

2048
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
randomness and probability so if you're
 

2049
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,630
randomness and probability so if you're
uh

2050
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
uh
 

2051
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,190
uh
needs some uh primers on that we didn't

2052
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,200
needs some uh primers on that we didn't
 

2053
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,069
needs some uh primers on that we didn't
have

2054
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,079
have
 

2055
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,790
have
a lot of this in in double o6 but if you

2056
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:56,800
a lot of this in in double o6 but if you
 

2057
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,990
a lot of this in in double o6 but if you
go on to o46

2058
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,000
go on to o46
 

2059
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,190
go on to o46
that's going to be a really important

2060
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,200
that's going to be a really important
 

2061
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,109
that's going to be a really important
thing for you to brush up on

00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:01,119
thing for you to brush up on
 

2063
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,550

00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560
okay the next part on
 

2065
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,430

what are you talking about right i can't

2094
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
what are you talking about right i can't
 

2095
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,190
what are you talking about right i can't
do that on a computer

do that on a computer
 

2097
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,390
do that on a computer
but what i can do is basically

2098
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
but what i can do is basically
 

2099
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,870
but what i can do is basically
compute things in a numerical sense

2100
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:42,880
compute things in a numerical sense

and in o46 a lot of times we put this in

2106
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:51,920
and in o46 a lot of times we put this in
 

2107

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,400
you can maybe
 

2135
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,870
you can maybe
have a model of computation that allows

00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
have a model of computation that allows
 

2137

00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
but really what these these algorithms
 

2147
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,710
but really what these these algorithms
are usually about is

2148
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:44,720
are usually about is
 

2149
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,550
are usually about is
computing real numbers not completely

2150
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:48,560
computing real numbers not completely
 

2151
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,150

but to some bounded precision and i pay

2152
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,160
but to some bounded precision and i pay
 

2153
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,230
but to some bounded precision and i pay
for that precision right

00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,240
i have to pay for them right so this is
 

2161
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,870
i have to pay for them right so this is
basically

00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:00,880
basically
 

2163
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,069
basically
i think of these as an approximation

00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
i think of these as an approximation
 

2165
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,510
i think of these as an approximation
a approximation

00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
precision and
 

2173
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,430
precision and
i pay

2174
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
i pay
 

2175
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,829
i pay
for precision

2176
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:29,839
for precision
 

2177
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,270
for precision
with time

2178
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,280
with time
 

2179
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,109
with time
so let's say you know i want to compute

2180
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:35,119
so let's say you know i want to compute
 

2181
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,190
so let's say you know i want to compute
the square root of a number

2182
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,200
the square root of a number
 

2183
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,430
the square root of a number
i could have an algorithm just like the

2184
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:39,440
i could have an algorithm just like the
 

2185
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,550
i could have an algorithm just like the
algorithms

2186
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:40,560
algorithms
 

2187
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,790
algorithms
or i guess division right long division

2188
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:44,800
or i guess division right long division
 

2189
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,630
or i guess division right long division
you all know the algorithm of long

2190
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:46,640
you all know the algorithm of long
 

2191
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,030
you all know the algorithm of long
division you you know you put

2192
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,040
division you you know you put
 

2193
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,030
division you you know you put
a quotient under here with these you

2194
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
a quotient under here with these you
 

2195
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,630
a quotient under here with these you
know an a b and you get the

2196
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,640
know an a b and you get the
 

2197
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,349
know an a b and you get the
c on top or whatever right that's an

2198
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:55,359
c on top or whatever right that's an
 

2199
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,430
c on top or whatever right that's an
algorithm that's a procedure

2200
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
algorithm that's a procedure
 

2201
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,069
algorithm that's a procedure
using essentially small numbers i'm only

2202
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:00,079
using essentially small numbers i'm only
 

2203
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,069
using essentially small numbers i'm only
talking about the digits 0 to

2204
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
talking about the digits 0 to
 

2205
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,470
talking about the digits 0 to
9 here when i'm doing that algorithm so

2206
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,480
9 here when i'm doing that algorithm so
 

2207
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,069
9 here when i'm doing that algorithm so
it's a procedure

2208
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:06,079
it's a procedure
 

2209
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,349
it's a procedure
that only uses small integers to compute

2210
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
that only uses small integers to compute
 

2211
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,390
that only uses small integers to compute
arbitrary precision of a division

2212
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
arbitrary precision of a division
 

2213
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,870
arbitrary precision of a division
right so that's an algorithm and i have

2214
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:14,880
right so that's an algorithm and i have
 

2215
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,309
right so that's an algorithm and i have
to pay time

2216
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:16,319
to pay time
 

2217
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,950
to pay time
to get more digits right so that's

2218
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
to get more digits right so that's
 

2219
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,510
to get more digits right so that's
that's an

2220
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,520
that's an
 

2221
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,630
that's an
uh uh an example of this kind of how

2222
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,640
uh uh an example of this kind of how
 

2223
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,670
uh uh an example of this kind of how
how we live in the world of real numbers

2224
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
how we live in the world of real numbers
 

2225
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,150
how we live in the world of real numbers
when all we have is a discrete system

2226
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,160
when all we have is a discrete system
 

2227
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,910
when all we have is a discrete system
okay and then the last kind of

2228
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
okay and then the last kind of
 

2229
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,309
okay and then the last kind of
category i'd like to talk about here is

2230
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
category i'd like to talk about here is
 

2231
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,270
category i'd like to talk about here is
is really

2232
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
is really
 

2233
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,870
is really
approximation algorithms

2234
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880

 

2235
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,950

whereas this is kind of an approximation

2236
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960
whereas this is kind of an approximation
 

2237
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,430
whereas this is kind of an approximation
algorithm i'm approximating my outputs

2239
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,390
algorithm i'm approximating my outputs
this is an approximation algorithm from

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:48,400
this is an approximation algorithm from
 

2241
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,550
this is an approximation algorithm from
the standpoint of

2242
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,560
the standpoint of
 

2243
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,630
the standpoint of
well there's a lot of problems that i

2244
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:52,640
well there's a lot of problems that i
 

2245
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,150
well there's a lot of problems that i
can't solve efficiently they're np

2246
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,160
can't solve efficiently they're np
 

2247
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,190
can't solve efficiently they're np
hard they're they're in x or

2248
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:57,200
hard they're they're in x or
 

2249
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,470
hard they're they're in x or
you know even harder problems

2250
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:00,480
you know even harder problems
 

2251
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,550
you know even harder problems
but uh maybe i'm okay with not getting

2252
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
but uh maybe i'm okay with not getting
 

2253
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,550
but uh maybe i'm okay with not getting
the optimal solution so this is in the

2254
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:06,560
the optimal solution so this is in the
 

2255
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,589
the optimal solution so this is in the
domain of

2256
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:07,599
domain of
 

2257
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,870

2259
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,230
optimization problems
so most of the dynamic programming

2260
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
so most of the dynamic programming
 

2261
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,430
so most of the dynamic programming
problems that we gave you are

2262
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:19,440
problems that we gave you are
 

2263
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,870
problems that we gave you are
optimization problems or the shortest

well in an approximation algorithm what
 

2287
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,470
well in an approximation algorithm what
i do is okay i get

2288
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:44,480
i do is okay i get
 

2289
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,470
i do is okay i get
that it's computationally difficult for

00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,480
that it's computationally difficult for
 

2291
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,550
that it's computationally difficult for

2299
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,710

but maybe

2300
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:56,720
but maybe
 

2301
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,230
but maybe
that's okay i mean my engineering

2302
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
that's okay i mean my engineering
 

2303
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,550
that's okay i mean my engineering
spidey sense tells me that within 10 is

2304
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:02,560
spidey sense tells me that within 10 is
 

2305
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,829
spidey sense tells me that within 10 is
fine

2319
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,630
thing
right usually we're looking for constant

2320
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:16,640
right usually we're looking for constant
 

2321
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,390
right usually we're looking for constant
factor approximations which are

00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:18,400
factor approximations which are
 

2323
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,750
factor approximations which are
have low constant or you know

2324
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:21,760
have low constant or you know
 

2325
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,470
have low constant or you know
maybe even have to do for worse if such

2326
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480
maybe even have to do for worse if such
 

2327
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,829
maybe even have to do for worse if such
things don't exist

2328
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
things don't exist
 

2329
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,470
things don't exist
okay so that's approximation algorithms

2330
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:28,480
okay so that's approximation algorithms
 

2331
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,430
okay so that's approximation algorithms
you know

2332
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:29,440
you know
 

2333
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,829
you know
can we get close to an optim optimal

2334
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:31,839
can we get close to an optim optimal
 

2335
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,430
can we get close to an optim optimal

okay and then the last

2338
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:36,960
okay and then the last
 

2339
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,270
okay and then the last
way we could change things in especially

2340
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,280
way we could change things in especially
 

2341
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,790
way we could change things in especially
future classes though sometimes they

2342
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
future classes though sometimes they
 

2343
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,910
future classes though sometimes they
talk about this

2344
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:41,920
talk about this
 

2345
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,470
talk about this
in o46 as well is we could change the

2346
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:44,480
in o46 as well is we could change the
 

2347
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,390
in o46 as well is we could change the
model of computation

2348
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,400
model of computation
 

2349
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,910
model of computation
right we could basically change

2350
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920
right we could basically change
 

2351
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,990
right we could basically change
something about our computer

2352
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,000
something about our computer
 

2353
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,549
something about our computer

of of
of solving problems with more power

2358
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,160
of solving problems with more power
 

2359
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,030
of solving problems with more power
essentially or

2360
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
essentially or
 

2361
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,470
essentially or
or you're in a situation where there's

2362
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:58,480
or you're in a situation where there's
 

2363
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,870
or you're in a situation where there's
less power okay so change in the model

2364
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:00,880
less power okay so change in the model
 

2365
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:09,190
less power okay so change in the model
of computation

2366
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,200

 

2367
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,470

okay

2368
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:12,480

 

2369
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,670

so what we've been talking to you in

2370
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:15,680
so what we've been talking to you in
 

2371
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,190
so what we've been talking to you in
terms of model of computation is our

2372
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:17,200
terms of model of computation is our
 

2373
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:17,990
terms of model of computation is our
word ramp

2374
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,000
word ramp
 

2375
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,150
word ramp
right word ram

2376
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
right word ram
 

2377
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,309
right word ram
that essentially says i can do it

2378
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:24,319
that essentially says i can do it
 

2379
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,990
that essentially says i can do it
arithmetic operations and i can look up

2380
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
arithmetic operations and i can look up
 

2381
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,309
arithmetic operations and i can look up
stuff in my memory in constant time

2382
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
stuff in my memory in constant time
 

2383
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,109
stuff in my memory in constant time
and but if i allocate a certain amount i

2384
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:31,119
and but if i allocate a certain amount i
 

2385
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,549
and but if i allocate a certain amount i
have to pay that amount and that kind of

2386
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:32,559
have to pay that amount and that kind of
 

2387
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:33,670
have to pay that amount and that kind of
thing so that's this

2388
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,680
thing so that's this
 

2389
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,829
thing so that's this
word ram model but in actuality

2390
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:37,839
word ram model but in actuality
 

2391
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,030
word ram model but in actuality
all of your computers you know it's a

00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,440
it's a lot easier for me to figure uh to
 

2395
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,710
it's a lot easier for me to figure uh to
find and read

2396
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:44,720
find and read
 

2397
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,630

00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,640
well in my day it used to be this this
 

2405
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,710

00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:51,280
those things and instead of having to
 

2453
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,510
those things and instead of having to
having all of our operations be you know

00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,750
are actually different
and i have to pay for that difference

2460
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:01,760
and i have to pay for that difference
 

2461
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,870
and i have to pay for that difference
okay and so that's

2462
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
okay and so that's

2524
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
i'm not going to go into that but you
 

2525
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,270
i'm not going to go into that but you
know

2526
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:11,280
know
 

2527
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,349
know
i mean some people like you look at

2528
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
i mean some people like you look at
 

2529
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,109
i mean some people like you look at
artificial intelligence and things like

2530
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:15,119
artificial intelligence and things like
 

2531
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:15,990
artificial intelligence and things like
discussions around

2532
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,000
discussions around
 

2533
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,670
discussions around
artificial intelligence my brain

2534
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:19,680
artificial intelligence my brain
 

2535
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,630
artificial intelligence my brain
you know might be doing things that a

2536
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:22,640
you know might be doing things that a
 

2537
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,829
you know might be doing things that a
classical

2538
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:23,839
classical
 

2539
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,270
classical
computer cannot right it could be

2540
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
computer cannot right it could be
 

2541
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,829
computer cannot right it could be
using quantum superposition in some way

2542
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
using quantum superposition in some way
 

2543
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,670
using quantum superposition in some way
and our computers

2544
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:31,680
and our computers
 

2545
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,230
and our computers
that are in your phone and your laptop

2546
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
that are in your phone and your laptop
 

2547
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,510
that are in your phone and your laptop
and things like that aren't exploiting

2548
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:35,520
and things like that aren't exploiting
 

2549
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,950
and things like that aren't exploiting
those operations so how could we ever

2550
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:36,960
those operations so how could we ever
 

2551
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,470
those operations so how could we ever
get intelligence because

2552
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:38,480
get intelligence because
 

2553
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,990
get intelligence because
you know in some sense our brains are

2554
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:40,000
you know in some sense our brains are
 

2555
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,510
you know in some sense our brains are
more powerful right

2556
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
more powerful right
 

2557
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,910
more powerful right
and so a lot of what ai should be

2558
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:43,920
and so a lot of what ai should be
 

2559
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,030
and so a lot of what ai should be
looking into

2560
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
looking into
 

2561
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,589
looking into
is what is the actual model of

2562
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:47,599
is what is the actual model of
 

2563
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,549
is what is the actual model of
computation of our brains that can give

2564
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:50,559
computation of our brains that can give
 

2565
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,190
computation of our brains that can give
us the power to have sentience

2566
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,200
us the power to have sentience
 

2567
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,510
us the power to have sentience
right okay so that's that's kind of

2568
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
right okay so that's that's kind of
 

2569
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,790
right okay so that's that's kind of
quantum computing i don't know much

2570
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:56,800
quantum computing i don't know much
 

2571
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,309
quantum computing i don't know much
about it actually

2572
00:51:58,309 --> 00:51:58,319
about it actually
 

2573
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,870
about it actually
uh and then there's things like maybe i

2574
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:00,880
uh and then there's things like maybe i
 

2575
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,349
uh and then there's things like maybe i
have

2576
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:01,359
have
 

2577
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,790
have
more than one cpu right

2578
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
more than one cpu right
 

2579
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,190
more than one cpu right
i i mean most computer all the computers

2580
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:07,200
i i mean most computer all the computers
 

2581
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,549
i i mean most computer all the computers
you have even the ones in your phone

2582
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
you have even the ones in your phone
 

2583
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,630
you have even the ones in your phone
probably have multiple cores

2584
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:10,640
probably have multiple cores
 

2585
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,950
probably have multiple cores
right in a sense you have lots of cpos

2586
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
right in a sense you have lots of cpos
 

2587
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,309
right in a sense you have lots of cpos
running in parallel

2588
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:14,319
running in parallel
 

2589
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,349
running in parallel
right so this is like pair uh there's

2590
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
right so this is like pair uh there's
 

2591
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:17,670
right so this is like pair uh there's
one

2592
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:17,680
one
 

2593
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:27,030
one
r in parallel

2594
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:27,040

 

2595
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,910

okay parallel computing basically says

2596
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
okay parallel computing basically says
 

2597
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,390
okay parallel computing basically says
you know

2598
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:30,400
you know
 

2599
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,230
you know
it's cheap for me to make another

2600
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,240
it's cheap for me to make another
 

2601
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,069
it's cheap for me to make another
computer potentially

2602
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:34,079
computer potentially
 

2603
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,790
computer potentially
right if i have two computers running on

2604
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:36,800
right if i have two computers running on
 

2605
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,990
right if i have two computers running on
the same problem

2606
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,000
the same problem
 

2607
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,030
the same problem
maybe i can get a two-fold speed up

2608
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,040
maybe i can get a two-fold speed up
 

2609
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,430
maybe i can get a two-fold speed up
on my on the this the time in which it

2610
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:43,440
on my on the this the time in which it
 

2611
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,309
on my on the this the time in which it
takes to

2612
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:44,319
takes to
 

2613
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,829
takes to
solve my problem now that's not

2614
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:47,839
solve my problem now that's not
 

2615
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,870
solve my problem now that's not
i mean suppose i had then 100 cpus

2616
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:50,880
i mean suppose i had then 100 cpus
 

2617
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,829
i mean suppose i had then 100 cpus
running on a machine

2618
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
running on a machine
 

2619
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,829
running on a machine
maybe i can get 100 fold speed up and

2620
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:53,839
maybe i can get 100 fold speed up and
 

2621
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,910
maybe i can get 100 fold speed up and
and actually in in real life

2622
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:55,920
and actually in in real life
 

2623
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,390
and actually in in real life
a hundred fold speed up makes a

2624
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:58,400
a hundred fold speed up makes a
 

2625
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,190
a hundred fold speed up makes a
difference

2626
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
difference
 

2627
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,990
difference
right it's am i waiting for this for 10

2628
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,000
right it's am i waiting for this for 10
 

2629
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,870
right it's am i waiting for this for 10
minutes

2630
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
minutes
 

2631
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,030
minutes
or am i waiting for this for a thousand

2632
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,040
or am i waiting for this for a thousand
 

2633
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,950
or am i waiting for this for a thousand
minutes right that's

2634
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
minutes right that's
 

2635
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,430
minutes right that's
that's like all day i don't want to do

2636
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,440
that's like all day i don't want to do
 

2637
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,349
that's like all day i don't want to do
that that's maybe it's on weeks i don't

2638
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:11,359
that that's maybe it's on weeks i don't
 

2639
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:11,670
that that's maybe it's on weeks i don't
even

2640
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
even
 

2641
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,670
even
remember right okay but parallel

2642
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
remember right okay but parallel
 

2643
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,270
remember right okay but parallel
computing right

2644
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:15,280
computing right
 

2645
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,030
computing right
if i can get a 100 fold speed up that

2646
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
if i can get a 100 fold speed up that
 

2647
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,790
if i can get a 100 fold speed up that
might be a huge win

2648
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:18,800
might be a huge win
 

2649
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,230
might be a huge win
but for some problems it's not possible

2650
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:22,240
but for some problems it's not possible
 

2651
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,069
but for some problems it's not possible
you know if i have k cpus

2652
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:26,079
you know if i have k cpus
 

2653
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,430
you know if i have k cpus
can i get a k factor speed up it's not

2654
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:29,440
can i get a k factor speed up it's not
 

2655
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,589
can i get a k factor speed up it's not
always possible to do

2656
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:31,599
always possible to do
 

2657
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,069
always possible to do
okay and so parallel computing is

2658
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:34,079
okay and so parallel computing is
 

2659
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,270
okay and so parallel computing is
another paradigm

2660
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:35,280
another paradigm
 

2661
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,990
another paradigm
in which uh there's a lot of interesting

2662
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,000
in which uh there's a lot of interesting
 

2663
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,829
in which uh there's a lot of interesting
theory going on

2664
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:39,839
theory going on
 

2665
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,549
theory going on
uh there's a lot of complications there

2666
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
uh there's a lot of complications there
 

2667
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,270
uh there's a lot of complications there
because

2668
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:43,280
because
 

2669
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,470
because
you know there are a couple different

2670
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,480
you know there are a couple different
 

2671
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,150
you know there are a couple different
models you could have a multi-core setup

2672
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,160
models you could have a multi-core setup
 

2673
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:46,630
models you could have a multi-core setup
where

2674
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:46,640
where
 

2675
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,230
where
you have a lot of computers that are

2676
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
you have a lot of computers that are
 

2677
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,790
you have a lot of computers that are
accessing the same bank of memory

2678
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
accessing the same bank of memory
 

2679
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,309
accessing the same bank of memory
and then you don't want them all to be

2680
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
and then you don't want them all to be
 

2681
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,230
and then you don't want them all to be
reading and writing from them

2682
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
reading and writing from them
 

2683
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,069
reading and writing from them
at different times because you don't

2684
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:56,079
at different times because you don't
 

2685
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,750
at different times because you don't
necessarily know what their state is and

2686
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:57,760
necessarily know what their state is and
 

2687
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,390
necessarily know what their state is and
you get

2688
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:58,400
you get
 

2689
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,150
you get
these collisions which are something

2690
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:00,160
these collisions which are something
 

2691
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,990
these collisions which are something
that you really have to think about in

2692
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:02,000
that you really have to think about in
 

2693
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,190
that you really have to think about in

this world
 

2695
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,829
this world
or you have situations where maybe i

2696
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:05,839
or you have situations where maybe i
 

2697
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:06,870
or you have situations where maybe i
have a bunch of

2698
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:06,880
have a bunch of
 

2699
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,670

nano flies or something that are going
 

2701
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,069
nano flies or something that are going
around

2702
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
around
 

2703
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,390
around
and they have very small computer brains

2704
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:12,400
and they have very small computer brains

00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:16,720
right but they can talk to each other
 

2709
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,309
right but they can talk to each other
and pass information to each other

2710
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
and pass information to each other
 

2711
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,589
and pass information to each other
but they don't have access to one

2712
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:19,599
but they don't have access to one
 

2713

where all of the you know cpus that you

2722
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:28,559
where all of the you know cpus that you
 

2723
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:29,109
where all of the you know cpus that you
have can

2724
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119
have can
 

2725
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,589
have can
interact with each other maybe locally

2726
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:31,599
interact with each other maybe locally
 

2727
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,829
interact with each other maybe locally
but don't have access to the same

00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
but don't have access to the same
 

2729
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,789
but don't have access to the same
uh memory system so they have to work

2730
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:36,799
uh memory system so they have to work
 

2731
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,510
uh memory system so they have to work
together

2732
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:37,520
together

to gain to to learn information about
 

2735
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:41,750
to gain to to learn information about
the system

2736
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:41,760
the system
 

2737
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,710
the system
okay so this is that's a a brief

2738
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
okay so this is that's a a brief
 

2739
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,150
okay so this is that's a a brief
overview of the different directions

2740
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:48,160
overview of the different directions
 

2741
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,349
overview of the different directions
this class 6006 and theory in general

2742
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359
this class 6006 and theory in general
 

2743
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,150
this class 6006 and theory in general
could lead you

2744
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,160
could lead you
 

2745
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,870
could lead you
into a huge array of different uh

2746
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:54,880
into a huge array of different uh
 

2747
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,710
into a huge array of different uh
branches of theory

2748
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
branches of theory
 

2749
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,309
branches of theory
and different problems that you could

2750
00:54:58,309 --> 00:54:58,319
and different problems that you could
 

2751
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,910
and different problems that you could
address with different types of

2752
00:54:59,910 --> 00:54:59,920
address with different types of
 

2753
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,109
address with different types of
computers

2754
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:01,119
computers
 

2755
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,670
computers
okay so uh i know this is a very high

2756
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:03,680
okay so uh i know this is a very high
 

2757
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,870
okay so uh i know this is a very high
level lecture

2758
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880
level lecture
 

2759
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,950
level lecture
and uh and maybe less applied than

2760
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:08,960
and uh and maybe less applied than
 

2761
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,190
and uh and maybe less applied than
some of you might like but i hope this

2762
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,200
some of you might like but i hope this
 

2763
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,270
some of you might like but i hope this
gives you a good understanding of

2764
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:13,280
gives you a good understanding of
 

2765
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,829
gives you a good understanding of
kind of the way the directions you can

2766
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
kind of the way the directions you can
 

2767
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:16,549
kind of the way the directions you can
go

2768
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
go
 

2769
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,349
go
after this class uh that i think are

2770
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:19,359
after this class uh that i think are
 

2771
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,470
after this class uh that i think are
really excited

2772
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:20,480
really excited
 

2773
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,950
really excited
in terms of uh how to solve problems

2774
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,960
in terms of uh how to solve problems
 

2775
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,230
in terms of uh how to solve problems
computationally

2776
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
computationally
 

2777
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:32,829
computationally
okay so with that uh i'd like to end

2778
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:32,839

 

2779
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,839

there
