177
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,830
different kinds right
there's a there's a exponential number

178
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
there's a there's a exponential number
 

179
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,509
there's a there's a exponential number
of different programs that we can write

180
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
of different programs that we can write
 

181
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,750
of different programs that we can write
and that's part of why you're here is to

182
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
and that's part of why you're here is to
 

183
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,190
and that's part of why you're here is to
write the next best one

184
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
write the next best one
 

185
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,710
write the next best one
right so that's how to how to make uh

186
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
right so that's how to how to make uh
 

187
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,910
right so that's how to how to make uh
kind of a universal a device uh

188
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
kind of a universal a device uh
 

189
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,149
kind of a universal a device uh
at the electronic level what if we could

190
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
at the electronic level what if we could
 

191
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,430
at the electronic level what if we could
do that

192
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
do that
 

193
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,750
do that
in a material from a material standpoint

194
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
in a material from a material standpoint

in a material from a material standpoint
what if i could

196
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
what if i could
 

197
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,509
what if i could
reprogram the matter in my phone so that

198
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
reprogram the matter in my phone so that
 

199
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,470
reprogram the matter in my phone so that
not only

200
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
not only
 

201
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,190
not only
uh could i reprogram the app that's on

202
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
uh could i reprogram the app that's on
 

203
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,910

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
i started moving into computer science
 

235
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,710
i started moving into computer science
because i found that it was

236
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
because i found that it was
 

237
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,830
because i found that it was
a really good way to model the world and

238
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
a really good way to model the world and
 

239
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,990
a really good way to model the world and
solve some really interesting problems

240
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
solve some really interesting problems
 

241
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,790
solve some really interesting problems
uh about folding that i i really enjoyed

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,550
kinds of problems one
the big one is origami design or general

284
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
the big one is origami design or general
 

285
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,150
the big one is origami design or general
folding design where you have some

286
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
folding design where you have some
 

287
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,590
folding design where you have some
specifications of what you'd like to

288
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600

in this case i wanted to make a logo for

292
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
in this case i wanted to make a logo for
 

293
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,469
in this case i wanted to make a logo for
6849

294
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
6849
 

295
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,749
6849
and i imagined extruding that text

296
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
and i imagined extruding that text
 

297
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,629
and i imagined extruding that text
into third third dimension and then i

298
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
into third third dimension and then i
 

299
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,990
into third third dimension and then i
wanted an algorithm

300
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
wanted an algorithm
 

301
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,150
wanted an algorithm
to figure tell me how to fold that

302
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
to figure tell me how to fold that
 

303
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,749
to figure tell me how to fold that
structure and so there is an algorithm

304
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
structure and so there is an algorithm
 

305
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,950
structure and so there is an algorithm
which i'll talk about in a moment that

306
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
which i'll talk about in a moment that
 

307
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,309
which i'll talk about in a moment that
gives you a crease pattern and then

308
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
gives you a crease pattern and then
 

309
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,550
gives you a crease pattern and then
currently you fold it by hand the dream

310
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
currently you fold it by hand the dream
 

311
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,830
currently you fold it by hand the dream
is we'll eventually have folding

312
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
is we'll eventually have folding
 

313
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,990
is we'll eventually have folding
machines that do it all for us

314
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
machines that do it all for us
 

315
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,550
machines that do it all for us
um and so that's the origami design

316
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
um and so that's the origami design
 

317
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,909
um and so that's the origami design
where you go from the

318
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
where you go from the
 

319
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,510
where you go from the
the target shape back to the

320
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
the target shape back to the
 

321
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,309
the target shape back to the
um to the crease pattern the reverse

322
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
um to the crease pattern the reverse
 

323
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,990
um to the crease pattern the reverse
direction is sort of foldability if i

324
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
direction is sort of foldability if i
 

325
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,189
direction is sort of foldability if i
gave you a structure

326
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
gave you a structure
 

327
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,350
gave you a structure
like this and i wanted to know does it

328
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
like this and i wanted to know does it
 

329
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,710
like this and i wanted to know does it
fold

330
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720

that's a problem we call foldability in

332
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
that's a problem we call foldability in
 

333
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,469
that's a problem we call foldability in

jason and i proved that foldability is

340
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
jason and i proved that foldability is
 

341
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,950
jason and i proved that foldability is
hard for a general given a crease

thing you do
 

401
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,990
thing you do
is fold it down into a very long narrow

402
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
is fold it down into a very long narrow
 

403
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,629

wasting most of the material
 

409
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,390
wasting most of the material
and then you take your strip and you

410
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
and then you take your strip and you
 

411
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,430
and then you take your strip and you
just figure out how to

412
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
just figure out how to
 

413
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,070
just figure out how to
turn it in some general way and then you

414
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
turn it in some general way and then you
 

415
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,909
turn it in some general way and then you
just sort of zigzag back and forth along

416
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
just sort of zigzag back and forth along
 

417
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,870

start with something smaller
but that's the general idea and it's

564
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
but that's the general idea and it's
 

565
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,949
but that's the general idea and it's
actually quite easy to prove this

so there are you know some constant

580
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
so there are you know some constant
 

581
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,389
so there are you know some constant
number of different ways that each

582

number of different ways that each
 

583
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,829
number of different ways that each
vertex could look it could be degree

584
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
vertex could look it could be degree
 

585
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,430
vertex could look it could be degree
four it could be degree three

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
four it could be degree three
 

587
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,069
four it could be degree three
uh in as a t it could be degree two

588
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
uh in as a t it could be degree two
 

589

and you design little gadgets little

592
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
and you design little gadgets little
 

593
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,670
and you design little gadgets little
crease patterns that fold into each of

594
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
crease patterns that fold into each of
 

595
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,870
crease patterns that fold into each of
those little structures

596
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
those little structures
 

597
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,470
those little structures
and if you can do it in a way that these

598
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
and if you can do it in a way that these
 

599
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,990
and if you can do it in a way that these
boundaries are compatible

600
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
boundaries are compatible
 

601
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,590
boundaries are compatible
then to fold the whole thing you just

602
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
then to fold the whole thing you just
 

603
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,870
then to fold the whole thing you just
sort of glue together those crease

604
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
sort of glue together those crease
 

605
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,389
sort of glue together those crease
patterns and that's how that software

606
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
patterns and that's how that software
 

607
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,310
patterns and that's how that software
works

608
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
works
 

609
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,230
works
and so that was this is particularly

610
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
and so that was this is particularly
 

611
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,670
and so that was this is particularly
interesting because you can fold an

612
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
interesting because you can fold an
 

613
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,829
interesting because you can fold an

uh and so we use sculpture to try to

688
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
uh and so we use sculpture to try to
 

689
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,230
uh and so we use sculpture to try to
explore and understand intuitively how

and each of those dangling ends can have
 

817
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,430
and each of those dangling ends can have
a particular pattern and only

818
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
a particular pattern and only
 

819
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,750
a particular pattern and only
identical or complementary patterns will

820
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
identical or complementary patterns will

with four different glues and you can

852
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
with four different glues and you can
 

853
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,990
with four different glues and you can
build any square you want

854
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
build any square you want
 

855
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,430
build any square you want
but you don't have very many of these

856
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
but you don't have very many of these
 

857
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,590
but you don't have very many of these
different glues ideally

858
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
different glues ideally
 

859
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,790
different glues ideally
and then if you have two tiles with

860
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
and then if you have two tiles with
 

861
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,389
and then if you have two tiles with
complementary glues they'll want to

862
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
complementary glues they'll want to
 

863
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,509
complementary glues they'll want to
match together but it depends how strong

864
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
match together but it depends how strong
 

865
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:39,990
match together but it depends how strong
this glue

866
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
this glue
 

867
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,910
this glue
is how much affinity there is for how

868
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
is how much affinity there is for how
 

869
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,389
is how much affinity there is for how
long those dna dangling ends are

870
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
long those dna dangling ends are
 

871
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,990
long those dna dangling ends are
and also the temperature of your system

872
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
and also the temperature of your system
 

873
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,030
and also the temperature of your system
if you have really high temperature

874
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
if you have really high temperature
 

875
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,310
if you have really high temperature
nothing will stick together

876
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
nothing will stick together
 

877
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,590
nothing will stick together
low temperature things will stick

878
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
low temperature things will stick
 

879
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,150
low temperature things will stick
together even if they're not supposed to

880
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
together even if they're not supposed to
 

881
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,310
together even if they're not supposed to
and so you can if you tune your system

882
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
and so you can if you tune your system
 

883
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,670
and so you can if you tune your system
really well

884
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
really well
 

885
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,870
really well
you can design uh a system so that maybe

886
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
you can design uh a system so that maybe
 

887
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,509
you can design uh a system so that maybe
these guys

888
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
these guys
 

889
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,310
these guys
these glues are really strong and so

890
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
these glues are really strong and so
 

891
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,710
these glues are really strong and so
let's

892
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
let's
 

893
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,150
let's
i don't know right e here eric

894
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
i don't know right e here eric
 

895
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,150
i don't know right e here eric
and so these tiles will always glue

896
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
and so these tiles will always glue
 

897
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,310
and so these tiles will always glue
together but only when all three of

898
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
together but only when all three of
 

899
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,790
together but only when all three of
these

900
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
these
 

901
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,030
these
are glued together can this tile which

902
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
are glued together can this tile which
 

903
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,829
are glued together can this tile which
has c

904
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
has c
 

905
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,590
has c
complement and f complement

906
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
complement and f complement
 

907
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,670
complement and f complement
then it will if you set the temperatures

908
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
then it will if you set the temperatures
 

909
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,269
then it will if you set the temperatures
just right only because both of these

910
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
just right only because both of these
 

911
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,230
just right only because both of these
edges match

912
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
edges match
 

913
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,990
edges match
will this style be able to come in and

914
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
will this style be able to come in and
 

915
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,269
will this style be able to come in and
that's the basis for that

916
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
that's the basis for that
 

917
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,350
that's the basis for that
building that binary counter and so this

918
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
building that binary counter and so this
 

919
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,590
building that binary counter and so this
is a very different model of computation

920
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
is a very different model of computation
 

921
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,350
is a very different model of computation
from what we're used to in this class

922
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
from what we're used to in this class
 

923
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,030
from what we're used to in this class
where you think of instructions and they

924
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
where you think of instructions and they
 

925
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,710
where you think of instructions and they
run one at a time here the

926
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
run one at a time here the
 

927
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,509
run one at a time here the
model of computation is geometric it's

928
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
model of computation is geometric it's
 

929
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,949

930
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
these squares that are just floating
 

931
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,430
these squares that are just floating

and gluing together and so your program

934
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
and gluing together and so your program
 

935
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,910
and gluing together and so your program
at any moment is some

936
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
at any moment is some
 

937
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,790
at any moment is some
conglomerate of squares and so i just

938
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
conglomerate of squares and so i just
 

939
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,829
conglomerate of squares and so i just
wanted to mention it because it's a

940
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
wanted to mention it because it's a
 

941
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,790
wanted to mention it because it's a
really fun model

1075
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,630

so this is the set interface dynamic in

1076
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
so this is the set interface dynamic in
 

1077
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,750
so this is the set interface dynamic in
the sense that i have

1085
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,430

okay so exactly which subset of the set

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
okay so exactly which subset of the set
 

1087
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,789

stronger model
 

1137
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,590

um and we can do better than log n

1138
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
um and we can do better than log n
 

1139
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,950
um and we can do better than log n
in the following it'll take me a while

remember w is our word size so this is a
 

1157
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,029
remember w is our word size so this is a
bit of a weird running time it's great

bit of a weird running time it's great
 

1159
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,470
bit of a weird running time it's great
if w is like log n

if w is like log n
 

1161
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,029
if w is like log n
then this is log log n and we know w is

1162
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
then this is log log n and we know w is
 

1163
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,590
then this is log log n and we know w is
at least log n but it could be bigger

1164
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
at least log n but it could be bigger
 

1165
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,350
at least log n but it could be bigger
we don't really have a sense of how big

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
we don't really have a sense of how big

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,630
we don't really have a sense of how big
w can get maybe it's even

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
w can get maybe it's even
 

1169
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,549
w can get maybe it's even
n maybe it's big and then these are the

1170
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
n maybe it's big and then these are the
 

1171
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,549
n maybe it's big and then these are the
same maybe it's bigger than n

1172
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
same maybe it's bigger than n
 

1173

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
there's another data structure which
 

1185
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,669
there's another data structure which
runs in log n divided by log w

1186
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
runs in log n divided by log w
 

1187
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,789
runs in log n divided by log w
this is called fusion trees this was

1188
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
this is called fusion trees this was
 

1189
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,070
this is called fusion trees this was
invented around the time that cold

1190
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
invented around the time that cold
 

1191
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,149
invented around the time that cold
fusion was in the news and so

1192
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
fusion was in the news and so
 

1193
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,549
fusion was in the news and so
they wanted data structures to represent

1194
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
they wanted data structures to represent
 

1195
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,750
they wanted data structures to represent
and so we can achieve this bound or we

1196
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
and so we can achieve this bound or we
 

1197
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,870
and so we can achieve this bound or we
can achieve this bound

1198
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
can achieve this bound
 

1199
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,230
can achieve this bound
and this bound as good is if w is large

1200
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
and this bound as good is if w is large
 

1201
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,110
and this bound as good is if w is large
this bound is good if w is small and so

1202
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
this bound is good if w is small and so
 

1203
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,390
this bound is good if w is small and so
you can always take the min

1204
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
you can always take the min
 

1205
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,750
you can always take the min
of the two whatever's better and in

1206
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
of the two whatever's better and in
 

1207
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,950
of the two whatever's better and in
particular

1208
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
particular
 

1209
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,789
particular
the min

1210
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
the min
 

1211
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,270
the min
uh the min of those two things

1212
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280
uh the min of those two things
 

1213
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,950
uh the min of those two things
is at most i think it's square root log

1214
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
is at most i think it's square root log
 

1215
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,909
is at most i think it's square root log
n over log log n

1216
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
n over log log n
 

1217
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,750
n over log log n
if you want to bound just in terms of n

1218
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
if you want to bound just in terms of n
 

1219
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,590
if you want to bound just in terms of n
then the crossover point between these

1220
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
then the crossover point between these
 

1221
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,669
then the crossover point between these
two is this place and so you're always

1222
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
two is this place and so you're always
 

1223
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,950
two is this place and so you're always
at most this which is

1224
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
at most this which is
 

1225
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,190
at most this which is
quite a bit better than the log n of avl

1226
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
quite a bit better than the log n of avl
 

1227
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,230
quite a bit better than the log n of avl
we've got a square root

1228
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
we've got a square root
 

1229
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,710
we've got a square root
and we've got a slight thing in the

1230
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
and we've got a slight thing in the
 

1231
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,470
and we've got a slight thing in the
denominator pretty tiny

1232
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
denominator pretty tiny
 

1233
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,909
denominator pretty tiny
but the big thing is the square root and

1234
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
but the big thing is the square root and
 

1235
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,510
but the big thing is the square root and
that's kind of cool and it turns out

1236
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
that's kind of cool and it turns out
 

1237
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:29,909
that's kind of cool and it turns out
that's

1238
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
that's
 

1239
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,750
that's
pretty much optimal in terms of an n

the min of these two in general is
 

1245
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,470

problem
uh a is the log of the space you're

1280
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
uh a is the log of the space you're
 

1281
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,390
uh a is the log of the space you're
using

1282
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,400
using
 

1283
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,029
using
so it's the address size uh good

1284
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
so it's the address size uh good
 

1285
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,230
so it's the address size uh good

um if you throw so it depends if you

1288
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:18,880
um if you throw so it depends if you
 

1289
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,630
um if you throw so it depends if you
have a polynomial space data structure

1290
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
have a polynomial space data structure
 

1291
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,590
have a polynomial space data structure
then basically

1292
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
then basically
 

1293
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,830
then basically
these are optimal and this is

1294
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
these are optimal and this is
 

1295
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,470
these are optimal and this is
generalizing to beyond that

1296
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
generalizing to beyond that

for arbitrary graphs but if your graph
 

1349
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,950
for arbitrary graphs but if your graph
has some structure like

1350
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
has some structure like
 

1351
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,390
has some structure like
it's a road network and there aren't too

it's a road network and there aren't too
many overpasses you can usually

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
many overpasses you can usually
 

1355
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,470
many overpasses you can usually
draw these graphs in the plane without

1356
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
draw these graphs in the plane without
 

1357
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,390
draw these graphs in the plane without
crossings that's the meaning of planar

1358
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
crossings that's the meaning of planar
 

1359
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,230
crossings that's the meaning of planar
maybe not exactly maybe just a few

this which i won't get into

1364
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
this which i won't get into
 

1365
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,029
this which i won't get into
but let's just think about planar graphs

1366
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
but let's just think about planar graphs
 

1367
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,549
but let's just think about planar graphs
planar graphs have some nice features

1368
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
planar graphs have some nice features
 

1369
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,510
planar graphs have some nice features
like

1370
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
like
 

1371
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,430
like
they always have a linear number of

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
they always have a linear number of
 

1373
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,269
they always have a linear number of
edges they're always sparse

1374
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279

 

1375
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,029

so you can immediately plug that into

1376
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,039
so you can immediately plug that into
 

1377
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,269
so you can immediately plug that into
our existing bounds but even so you know

three these are the levels
 

1473
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,230
three these are the levels
and let's just like delete some of those

1474
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,240
and let's just like delete some of those
 

1475
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,149
and let's just like delete some of those
layers let's say let's delete every

1477
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,430

fourth layer
 

1479
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,350
fourth layer
so maybe i delete this one i delete all

1480
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
so maybe i delete this one i delete all
 

1481
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,710
so maybe i delete this one i delete all
the vertices in that layer

1482
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
the vertices in that layer
 

1483
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,990
the vertices in that layer
and then i delete all the things in

1484
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,000
and then i delete all the things in
 

1485
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,310

and so on guessing

1488
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
and so on guessing
 

1489
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,350

i don't know which one to start with but

1490
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
i don't know which one to start with but
 

1491
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,190
i don't know which one to start with but
from i'll just try them all

1492
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,200
from i'll just try them all
 

1493
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,789
from i'll just try them all
and then i delete every fourth layer

1494
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
and then i delete every fourth layer
 

1495
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,310
and then i delete every fourth layer
after that

1496
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
after that
 

1497
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,470
after that
so i've deleted on average about a

1498
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
so i've deleted on average about a
 

1499
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,390
so i've deleted on average about a
quarter of the graph

1500
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
quarter of the graph
 

1501
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,149
quarter of the graph
and it turns out for a lot of problems

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
this happens you know fires and graphs
 

1515
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,149
this happens you know fires and graphs
then

1516
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
then
 

1517
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,710
then
this will only hurt your solution by

1518
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
this will only hurt your solution by
 

1519
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,149
this will only hurt your solution by
like a factor

1520
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:22,159
like a factor
 

1521
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,149
like a factor
of uh one plus a quarter

1522
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
of uh one plus a quarter
 

1523
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,110
of uh one plus a quarter
uh so you'll get a solution that's uh

1524
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,120
uh so you'll get a solution that's uh
 

1525
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,750
uh so you'll get a solution that's uh
within

1527
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,430

um and uh

1530
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
um and uh
 

1531
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,630

that works for any value of four so i

1532
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
that works for any value of four so i
 

1533
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,909
that works for any value of four so i
could do it for ten

1534
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
could do it for ten
 

1535
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,750
could do it for ten
and then i'd get within ten percent of

1536
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
and then i'd get within ten percent of
 

1537
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,269
and then i'd get within ten percent of
the optimal solution

1538

called the picture hanging problem so

1712
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
called the picture hanging problem so
 

1713
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,590
called the picture hanging problem so
imagine you have a picture

1714
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:37,600
imagine you have a picture
 

1715
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,350
imagine you have a picture
you want to hang it on a wall so you

1716
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
you want to hang it on a wall so you
 

1717
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,870
you want to hang it on a wall so you
invested in some nice rope

1718
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:40,880
invested in some nice rope
 

1719
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,510
invested in some nice rope
and you hang it and then if the on a

1720
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,520
and you hang it and then if the on a
 

1721
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,070
and you hang it and then if the on a
nail

1722
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,080
nail
 

1723
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,389
nail
if the nail falls out the picture falls

1724
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
if the nail falls out the picture falls
 

1725
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,269
if the nail falls out the picture falls
and you're set

1726
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
and you're set
 

1727
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,990
and you're set
so you invest in two nails like i have

1728
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
so you invest in two nails like i have
 

1729
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,470
so you invest in two nails like i have
here

1730
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
here
 

1731
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,470
here
and maybe you hang your picture on both

1732
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
and maybe you hang your picture on both
 

1733
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,710
and maybe you hang your picture on both
those nails now if one of the nails

1734
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:54,720
those nails now if one of the nails
 

1735
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,509
those nails now if one of the nails
falls out you still have a crookedly

1736
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:57,519
falls out you still have a crookedly
 

1737
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,389
falls out you still have a crookedly
hung picture

1738
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:58,399
hung picture
 

1739
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,430
hung picture
the other nail falls out okay it's gone

1740
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
the other nail falls out okay it's gone
 

1741
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,470
the other nail falls out okay it's gone
i want to hang a picture on two nails

1742
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
i want to hang a picture on two nails
 

1743
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,350
i want to hang a picture on two nails
such that if i remove either nail the

1744
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,360
such that if i remove either nail the
 

1745
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,509
such that if i remove either nail the
picture falls so jason pick a nail left

1746
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:09,519
picture falls so jason pick a nail left
 

1747
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,950
picture falls so jason pick a nail left
or right

1748
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
or right
 

1749
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,830
or right
left we remove make sure this doesn't

1750
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
left we remove make sure this doesn't
 

1751
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,630
left we remove make sure this doesn't
fall off

1752
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
fall off
 

1753
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,269
fall off
and boom the picture falls same wrapping

1754
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
and boom the picture falls same wrapping
 

1755
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,950
and boom the picture falls same wrapping
you can check you can rewind the video

1756
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:18,960
you can check you can rewind the video
 

1757
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,590
you can check you can rewind the video
make sure i did the same wrapping

1758
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600
make sure i did the same wrapping
 

1759
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,830
make sure i did the same wrapping
okay take out the right one good choice

1760
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:23,840
okay take out the right one good choice
 

1761
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,630
okay take out the right one good choice
uh

1762
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
uh
 

1763
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,669
uh
then also the picture false

1764
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
then also the picture false
 

1765
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,230
then also the picture false
uh and so this is a classic puzzle but

1766
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
uh and so this is a classic puzzle but
 

1767
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,870
uh and so this is a classic puzzle but
you can generalize it so let me do it to

1768
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:32,880
you can generalize it so let me do it to
 

1769
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,470
you can generalize it so let me do it to
for three nails which is all i have here

1770
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
for three nails which is all i have here
 

1771
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,590
for three nails which is all i have here
this nail sagging a little bit uh y

1772
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:39,600
this nail sagging a little bit uh y
 

1773
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,549
this nail sagging a little bit uh y
x and y inverse x inverse okay i think

1774
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:42,559
x and y inverse x inverse okay i think
 

1775
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,590
x and y inverse x inverse okay i think
that's right

1776
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
that's right
 

1777
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,669
that's right
uh so this is one way to hang a picture

1778
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
uh so this is one way to hang a picture
 

1779
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,269
uh so this is one way to hang a picture
on three nails such as if i remove any

1780
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
on three nails such as if i remove any
 

1781
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,070
on three nails such as if i remove any
of the nails

1782
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
of the nails
 

1783
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,430
of the nails
picture falls uh just justin uh one two

1784
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
picture falls uh just justin uh one two
 

1785
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,710
picture falls uh just justin uh one two
or three

1786
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:52,720
or three
 

1787
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,830
or three
two two okay

1788
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:55,840
two two okay
 

1789
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,509
two two okay
yeah i wanna get out of the way make

1790
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:57,519
yeah i wanna get out of the way make
 

1791
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,950
yeah i wanna get out of the way make
sure make sure i don't go

1792
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
sure make sure i don't go
 

1793
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,310
sure make sure i don't go
over the edge here

1794
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320

 

1795
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,710

yeah it's a lot easier to make this one

1796
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720
yeah it's a lot easier to make this one
 

1797
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,590
yeah it's a lot easier to make this one
work

1798
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:07,600
work
 

1799
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,029
work
but you can see boom picture falls there

1800
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
but you can see boom picture falls there
 

1801
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:11,669
but you can see boom picture falls there
and of course

1802
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
and of course
 

1803
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,389
and of course
imagine infinite gravity and the picture

1804
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
imagine infinite gravity and the picture
 

1805
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,230
imagine infinite gravity and the picture
falls tada

1806
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
falls tada
 

1807
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,230
falls tada
and so you can generalize this to do

1808
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
and so you can generalize this to do
 

1809
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,750
and so you can generalize this to do
essentially any

1810
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:19,760
essentially any
 

1811
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,509
essentially any
it's called a monotone boolean function

1812
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:21,519
it's called a monotone boolean function
 

1813
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,029
it's called a monotone boolean function
on any set of nails

1814
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:23,039
on any set of nails
 

1815
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,950
on any set of nails
i mean you can make any subset of the

1816
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:24,960
i mean you can make any subset of the
 

1817
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,549
i mean you can make any subset of the
nails cause the picture to fall

1818
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
nails cause the picture to fall
 

1819
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,149
nails cause the picture to fall
and any collection of subsets of nails

1820
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:28,159
and any collection of subsets of nails
 

1821
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,269
and any collection of subsets of nails
to make it fall of course if you remove

1822
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
to make it fall of course if you remove
 

1823
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,029
to make it fall of course if you remove
more nails it's still going to fall

1824
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:31,039
more nails it's still going to fall
 

1825
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,750
more nails it's still going to fall
that's the monotone sense but otherwise

1826
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
that's the monotone sense but otherwise
 

1827
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,509
that's the monotone sense but otherwise
you can do an arbitrary

1828
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
you can do an arbitrary
 

1829
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,350
you can do an arbitrary
pattern which is fun that's actually

1830
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
pattern which is fun that's actually
 

1831
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,590
pattern which is fun that's actually
result with ron rivest and a bunch of

other people um i think

1836
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:44,399
other people um i think
 

1837
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,430
other people um i think
i'm approximately on time so that was a

1838
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,440
i'm approximately on time so that was a
 

1839
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,389
i'm approximately on time so that was a
quick tour

1840
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:48,399
quick tour
 

1841
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,230
quick tour
and there are obviously various classes

1842
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,240
and there are obviously various classes
 

1843
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,990
and there are obviously various classes
here you can take

1844
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,000
here you can take
 

1845
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,789
here you can take
6892 the hardness class was just offered

6892 the hardness class was just offered
 

1847
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,389
6892 the hardness class was just offered
last semester so probably won't be for a

1848
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
last semester so probably won't be for a

00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,080
instructor chat eric was texting that he
 

1877
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,029
instructor chat eric was texting that he
was going to be

1878
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
was going to be
 

1879
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,630
was going to be
he was somehow nervous that the applied

1880
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
he was somehow nervous that the applied
 

1881
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,830
he was somehow nervous that the applied
guy would have all the like the cool

1882
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
guy would have all the like the cool
 

1883
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,870
guy would have all the like the cool
stuff to show off

stuff to show off
 

1885
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,870
stuff to show off
and now i feel totally boring uh

1886
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,880
and now i feel totally boring uh
 

1887
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,470
and now i feel totally boring uh
right yeah so yeah we have three

1888
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:44,480
right yeah so yeah we have three
 

1889
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,870
right yeah so yeah we have three
different geometry instructors uh

1890
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:46,880
different geometry instructors uh
 

1891
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,549
different geometry instructors uh
in in this class we have many different

1892
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
in in this class we have many different
 

1893
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,149
in in this class we have many different
flavors of geometry that are kind of

1894
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:52,159
flavors of geometry that are kind of
 

1895
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,830
flavors of geometry that are kind of
represented in this this room here from

slightly more applied geometry problems
 

1911
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,829
slightly more applied geometry problems
in some sense

in some sense
 

1913
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,510
in some sense
in seasonal we kind of cross a lot of

1914
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
in seasonal we kind of cross a lot of
 

1915
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,470
in seasonal we kind of cross a lot of
boundaries actually closer to the math

1916
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,480
boundaries actually closer to the math

uh i have some more fun things to to add
to the list and we'll introduce some of

1936
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,320
to the list and we'll introduce some of
 

1937
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,550
to the list and we'll introduce some of
the ideas in the next couple slides here

graphics course in fact my

1946
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:44,879
graphics course in fact my
 

1947
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,310
graphics course in fact my
background was was working in an

1948
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,320
background was was working in an
 

1949
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,430
background was was working in an
animation studio for a little bit of

1950
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:47,440
animation studio for a little bit of
 

1951
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,310
animation studio for a little bit of
time and and

1952
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,320
time and and
 

1953
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,109
time and and
uh got one movie credit out of it until

1954
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
uh got one movie credit out of it until
 

1955
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,550
uh got one movie credit out of it until
they changed the standards for movie

1956
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:52,560
they changed the standards for movie
 

1957
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,629
they changed the standards for movie
credits and then that stopped happening

1958
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:54,639
credits and then that stopped happening
 

1959
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,950
credits and then that stopped happening
uh but but in any event uh if you watch

1960
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:56,960
uh but but in any event uh if you watch
 

1961
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,030
uh but but in any event uh if you watch
what's that movie up with the old man

1962
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
what's that movie up with the old man
 

1963
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,230
what's that movie up with the old man
if you hit pause at just the right

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,670
if you hit pause at just the right
moment you can find me right above the

moment you can find me right above the
 

1967
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,910
moment you can find me right above the
list of babies that were born during

although computer graphics might not
 

1973
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,910
although computer graphics might not
sound like an algorithmic discipline

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,069
sound like an algorithmic discipline
i'll try to convince you guys that

1976
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,079
i'll try to convince you guys that
 

1977
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,670
i'll try to convince you guys that
in some sense you can take just about

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,270
in some sense you can take just about
anybody in our department have them

1980
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,280
anybody in our department have them
 

1981
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,589
anybody in our department have them
teach 606 and give a similar talk that

1982
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:17,599
teach 606 and give a similar talk that
 

1983
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,150
teach 606 and give a similar talk that
like

1984
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,160
like
 

1985
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,589
like
the material that you've encountered in

1986
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
the material that you've encountered in
 

1987
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,950
the material that you've encountered in
this course is going to be relevant to

1988
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
this course is going to be relevant to
 

1989
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,550
this course is going to be relevant to
your life

uh the other course that i teach that

1992
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
uh the other course that i teach that
 

1993
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,750
uh the other course that i teach that
might be of interest uh

1994
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:25,760
might be of interest uh
 

1995
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,790
might be of interest uh
and actually is a little more

1996
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800
and actually is a little more
 

1997
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,190
and actually is a little more
theoretically flavored uh that i teach

1998
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
theoretically flavored uh that i teach
 

1999
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,950
theoretically flavored uh that i teach
is a six eight three eight

2000
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
is a six eight three eight
 

2001
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,270
is a six eight three eight
so since eric so kindly put my board my

2002
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,280
so since eric so kindly put my board my
 

2003
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,390
so since eric so kindly put my board my
name on the board here i guess i can

2004
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,400
name on the board here i guess i can
 

2005
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,270
name on the board here i guess i can
draw a picture

2006
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
draw a picture
 

2007
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,750
draw a picture
so the main object of interest in six

2008
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:37,760
so the main object of interest in six
 

2009
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,550
so the main object of interest in six
eight three eight

00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:38,560
eight three eight
 

2011
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,990
eight three eight
is a particular thing called a

2012
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,000
is a particular thing called a
 

2013
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,990
is a particular thing called a
simplicial complex

2014
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,000

 

2015
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,150

so um usually uh in 606 we spend a lot

2016
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,160
so um usually uh in 606 we spend a lot
 

2017
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,750
so um usually uh in 606 we spend a lot
of time thinking about graphs

2018
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:51,760
of time thinking about graphs
 

2019
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,150
of time thinking about graphs
so let me draw you a graph so i'm going

2020
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,160
so let me draw you a graph so i'm going
 

2021
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,829
so let me draw you a graph so i'm going
to take a square

2022
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:55,839
to take a square
 

2023
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,349
to take a square
and subdivide it and now let's say i put

2024
00:35:59,349 --> 00:35:59,359
and subdivide it and now let's say i put
 

2025
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,310
and subdivide it and now let's say i put
edges diagonally

2026
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,320
edges diagonally
 

2027
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,349
edges diagonally
like that now

2028
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
like that now
 

2029
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,950
like that now
and pick from the most important thing

2030
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
and pick from the most important thing
 

2031
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,109
and pick from the most important thing
is a bunch of notes can

2032
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:09,119
is a bunch of notes can
 

2033
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,790
is a bunch of notes can
connect my edges in fact if i took this

2034
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
connect my edges in fact if i took this
 

2035
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,150
connect my edges in fact if i took this
edge and i like moved it down or

2036
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,160
edge and i like moved it down or
 

2037
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,829
edge and i like moved it down or
something it would be the same graph

2038
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
something it would be the same graph
 

2039
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,150
something it would be the same graph
uh but of course in a lot of uh computer

2040
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
uh but of course in a lot of uh computer
 

2041
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,230
uh but of course in a lot of uh computer
graphics applications this thing also

2042
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,240
graphics applications this thing also
 

2043
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,710
graphics applications this thing also
looks an awful lot like a square uh and

2044
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,720
looks an awful lot like a square uh and
 

2045
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,430
looks an awful lot like a square uh and
the reason

2046
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,440
the reason
 

2047
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,349
the reason
is that of course the graph here

2048
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:23,359
is that of course the graph here
 

2049
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,270
is that of course the graph here
contains triangles inside of it

2050
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,280
contains triangles inside of it
 

2051
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,710
contains triangles inside of it
uh and so for instance um maybe

2052
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:28,720
uh and so for instance um maybe
 

2053
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,069
uh and so for instance um maybe
i think of my graph as a collection of

2054
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:30,079
i think of my graph as a collection of
 

2055
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,069
i think of my graph as a collection of
vertices clutching edges this is the

2056
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:32,079
vertices clutching edges this is the
 

2057
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,750
vertices clutching edges this is the
sort of notation we've seen before

2058
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:33,760
sort of notation we've seen before
 

2059
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,670
sort of notation we've seen before
and then i add a third thing to my trip

2060
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:35,680
and then i add a third thing to my trip
 

2061
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,349
and then i add a third thing to my trip
uh to my

2062
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:37,359
uh to my
 

2063
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,030
uh to my
description which is a set of triplets

2064
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,040
description which is a set of triplets
 

2065
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,109
description which is a set of triplets
uh that's a set of triangles here

2066
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119
uh that's a set of triangles here
 

2067
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,470
uh that's a set of triangles here
right and we can take a lot of the

2068
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:42,480
right and we can take a lot of the
 

2069
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,829
right and we can take a lot of the
algorithms that we've talked about in

2070
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
algorithms that we've talked about in
 

2071
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,589
algorithms that we've talked about in
this class and extend it to this case so

2072
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:45,599
this class and extend it to this case so
 

2073
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,950
this class and extend it to this case so
for example

2074
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:46,960
for example
 

2075
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,310
for example
um here's a deceptively annoying one uh

2076
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,320
um here's a deceptively annoying one uh
 

2077
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,670
um here's a deceptively annoying one uh
let's say that i want the shortest path

2078
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
let's say that i want the shortest path
 

2079
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,150
let's say that i want the shortest path
between two vertices on my graph

2080
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
between two vertices on my graph
 

2081
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,870
between two vertices on my graph
yeah so we certainly have learned

2082
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:56,880
yeah so we certainly have learned
 

2083
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,550
yeah so we certainly have learned
dijkstra's algorithm as one technique to

2084
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:58,560
dijkstra's algorithm as one technique to
 

2085
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,270
dijkstra's algorithm as one technique to
do that

2086
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
do that
 

2087
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,510
do that
and indeed common practice in computer

2088
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:01,520
and indeed common practice in computer
 

2089
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,790
and indeed common practice in computer
graphics which is shameful

2090
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:02,800
graphics which is shameful

uh is on your triangle mesh if you want

2092
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,040
uh is on your triangle mesh if you want
 

2093
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,670
uh is on your triangle mesh if you want
the shortest path between two vertices

2094
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,680
the shortest path between two vertices
 

2095

run dijkstra's algorithm on the edges

2096
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:10,960
run dijkstra's algorithm on the edges
 

2097
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,150
run dijkstra's algorithm on the edges
and let's see if that works really quick

2098
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160
and let's see if that works really quick
 

2099
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,430
and let's see if that works really quick
so let's say that i want the shortest

2100
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:13,440
so let's say that i want the shortest
 

2101
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,870
so let's say that i want the shortest
path between

00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880
path between
 

2103
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,910
path between
and by the way i'm going to assume the

2104
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
and by the way i'm going to assume the
 

2105
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,750
and by the way i'm going to assume the
lengths of my edges are like the lengths

2106
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:17,760
lengths of my edges are like the lengths
 

2107
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,190
lengths of my edges are like the lengths
as i've drawn them on the board here so

2108
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,200
as i've drawn them on the board here so
 

2109
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,069
as i've drawn them on the board here so
it's like 1

2110
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:20,079
it's like 1
 

2111
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,510
it's like 1
1 square root of 2. okay so let's say i

2112
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
1 square root of 2. okay so let's say i
 

2113
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,630
1 square root of 2. okay so let's say i
want the shortest path between the

you'll get the path
 

2125
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,150
you'll get the path
that is these two edges but here's a

one of them might go all the way down
 

2145
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,190
one of them might go all the way down
and then all the way to the right

there's another mindset which is smooth
right so we think about

00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,160
right so we think about
 

2289
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,510
right so we think about

and then we might want to do stuff like
 

2297
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,990
and then we might want to do stuff like

2334
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:46,960
some constructions of topology like the
 

2335
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,870
some constructions of topology like the
durant complex and so on

2336
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:48,880
durant complex and so on
 

2337
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,870

00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
i would argue actually if you take our
 

2339
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,390
i would argue actually if you take our
course and then the differential

00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:52,400
course and then the differential
 

2341
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,470

something called ray casting

2580
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
something called ray casting
 

2581
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,390
something called ray casting
um or it's better known cousin ray

2582
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
um or it's better known cousin ray

00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
typically the difference is whether your
 

2587
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,710
typically the difference is whether your
rays can bounce off of the surface and

2588
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
rays can bounce off of the surface and
 

2589
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,150
rays can bounce off of the surface and
have a secondary thing

2590
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
have a secondary thing
 

2591
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,470
have a secondary thing
uh right so here's the raycasting

2592
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:40,480
uh right so here's the raycasting
 

2593
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,150
uh right so here's the raycasting
algorithm let's say i have a scene

2606
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:53,119
so i shoot a ray from my eyeball through
 

2607
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,069
so i shoot a ray from my eyeball through
that pixel

2608
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:54,079
that pixel
 

2609
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,550
that pixel
and find the first object that it runs

2610
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:56,560
and find the first object that it runs

it's not so hard to intersect a line

2614
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,640
it's not so hard to intersect a line
 

2615
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,950
it's not so hard to intersect a line
with a sphere or a line in the cube

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,550
with a sphere or a line in the cube
so what is that algorithm well i've

2618
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
so what is that algorithm well i've
 

2619
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,990
so what is that algorithm well i've
given it to you on the screen here

2620
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,000
given it to you on the screen here
 

2621
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,950
given it to you on the screen here
not too bad to think about and i think

2622
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
not too bad to think about and i think
 

2623
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,470
not too bad to think about and i think
you guys are all extremely well equipped

2624
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
you guys are all extremely well equipped
 

2625
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,630
you guys are all extremely well equipped
to analyze the runtime of this

2626
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
to analyze the runtime of this
 

2627
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,030
to analyze the runtime of this
which is roughly the uh number of pixels

2628
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,040
which is roughly the uh number of pixels
 

2629
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,230
which is roughly the uh number of pixels
times the number of objects right

2630
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
times the number of objects right
 

2631
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,430
times the number of objects right
because for every pixel

2632
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,440
because for every pixel
 

2633
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,750
because for every pixel
i gotta decide what object the ray out

2634
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:17,760
i gotta decide what object the ray out
 

2635
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,109
i gotta decide what object the ray out
of my eyeball hits first

2636
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:19,119
of my eyeball hits first
 

2637
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,589
of my eyeball hits first
so i need a for loop over every object

2638
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
so i need a for loop over every object
 

2639
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,349
so i need a for loop over every object
make sense

2640
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
make sense
 

2641
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,670
make sense
cool so let's uh look at sort of a basic

2642
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
cool so let's uh look at sort of a basic
 

2643
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,710
cool so let's uh look at sort of a basic
uh rendering

2644
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:26,720

in here so there's a very famous 3d

2650
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,240
in here so there's a very famous 3d
 

2651

extremely famous 3d model uh is actually

2672
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:50,960
extremely famous 3d model uh is actually
 

2673
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,470
extremely famous 3d model uh is actually
quite uh pernicious

2674
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,480
quite uh pernicious
 

2675
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,589
quite uh pernicious
it's composed of 69 000

it's composed of 69 000
 

2677
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,790
it's composed of 69 000
triangles and if i wanted 1080p like you

2678
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:58,800

00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,000
uh rendering of my triangle then of
 

2683
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,190
uh rendering of my triangle then of
course there's there's two million

2684
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,200
course there's there's two million
 

2685
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,630
course there's there's two million
pixels on the screen

2686
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:04,640
pixels on the screen
 

2687
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,710
pixels on the screen
so if we look at our big o expression

2688
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:06,720
so if we look at our big o expression
 

2689
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,309
so if we look at our big o expression
roughly our computation time scales like

2690
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
roughly our computation time scales like
 

2691
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,910
roughly our computation time scales like
the product of those two big numbers

2692
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:09,920
the product of those two big numbers
 

2693
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,230
the product of those two big numbers
uh so just to render this ugly gray

2694
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
uh so just to render this ugly gray
 

2695
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,990
uh so just to render this ugly gray
bunny it takes me

2696
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,000
bunny it takes me
 

2697
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,750
bunny it takes me
a pretty large amount of time yeah and

2698
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:15,760
a pretty large amount of time yeah and
 

2699
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,030
a pretty large amount of time yeah and
in fact uh the real

by the way the bunny is like this famous
 

2703
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,829
by the way the bunny is like this famous
test case in computer graphics so if you

2704
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:19,839
test case in computer graphics so if you
 

2705
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,030
test case in computer graphics so if you
take my class you'll be rendering

2706
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:21,040
take my class you'll be rendering
 

2707
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,230
take my class you'll be rendering
bunnies all day

bunnies all day
 

2709
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,309
bunnies all day
um you know the reality is we don't want

2710
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
um you know the reality is we don't want
 

2711
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,069
um you know the reality is we don't want
just like gray flat shaded bunnies we

2712
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,079
just like gray flat shaded bunnies we
 

2713
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:26,550
just like gray flat shaded bunnies we
want

2714
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:26,560
want
 

2715
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,710
want
bunnies that are transparent and

2716
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:28,720
bunnies that are transparent and
 

2717
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,910
bunnies that are transparent and
reflecting stuff

2718
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920
reflecting stuff
 

2719
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,510
reflecting stuff
and you know i shoot my bunny with a

2720
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,520
and you know i shoot my bunny with a
 

2721
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,870
and you know i shoot my bunny with a
bullet and it shatters into a million

2722
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
bullet and it shatters into a million
 

2723
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,109
bullet and it shatters into a million
pieces and all these cool things

2724
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:35,119
pieces and all these cool things
 

2725
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,349
pieces and all these cool things
so of course that raycasting algorithm

2726
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:37,359
so of course that raycasting algorithm
 

2727
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,710
so of course that raycasting algorithm
and each one of these new graphics

2728
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720
and each one of these new graphics
 

2729
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,150
and each one of these new graphics
features i add

2730
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:40,160
features i add
 

2731
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,870
features i add
only adds the time complexity of of the

2732
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
only adds the time complexity of of the
 

2733
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,790
only adds the time complexity of of the
technique uh that i implemented

2734
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:44,800
technique uh that i implemented
 

2735
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,390
technique uh that i implemented
so pretty quickly and indeed if you

2736
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:46,400
so pretty quickly and indeed if you
 

2737
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,910
so pretty quickly and indeed if you
write your own ray tracer at home which

2738
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:47,920
write your own ray tracer at home which
 

2739
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,829
write your own ray tracer at home which
i strongly encourage you to do

2740
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:49,839
i strongly encourage you to do
 

2741
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,910
i strongly encourage you to do
what you'll discover uh is that a

2742
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:51,920
what you'll discover uh is that a
 

2743
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,190
what you'll discover uh is that a
teleslope would be the

2744
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,200
teleslope would be the
 

2745
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,510
teleslope would be the
technical phrase uh so what is our way

2746
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,520
technical phrase uh so what is our way
 

2747
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,950
technical phrase uh so what is our way
out of this well

2748
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
out of this well
 

2749
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,510
out of this well
if you take uh a37 you'll see that our

2750
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,520
if you take uh a37 you'll see that our
 

2751
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,270
if you take uh a37 you'll see that our
way out of these problems and graphics

2752
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
way out of these problems and graphics
 

2753
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,950
way out of these problems and graphics
is data structures and algorithms

2754
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
is data structures and algorithms
 

2755
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,349
is data structures and algorithms
it's completely unavoidable so for

2756
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:05,359
it's completely unavoidable so for
 

2757
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,710
it's completely unavoidable so for
instance obviously we spent

2758
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
instance obviously we spent
 

2759
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,390
instance obviously we spent
quite a bit of time in this course uh

2760
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:08,400
quite a bit of time in this course uh
 

2761
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,150
quite a bit of time in this course uh
talking about avl trees

2762
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,160
talking about avl trees
 

2763
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,870
talking about avl trees
uh in age seven we'll spend a big chunk

2764
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:12,880
uh in age seven we'll spend a big chunk
 

2765
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,550
uh in age seven we'll spend a big chunk
of our tours talking about space

2766
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:14,560
of our tours talking about space
 

2767
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,069

partitioning trees
 

2769
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,470
partitioning trees
uh so here i've actually forgot what

2770
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:18,480
uh so here i've actually forgot what
 

2771
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,270
uh so here i've actually forgot what
kind of tree this

2772
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
kind of tree this
 

2773
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,950
kind of tree this
is i think it's a kg tree

2774
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:22,960
is i think it's a kg tree
 

2775
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,670
is i think it's a kg tree
doesn't matter um in any event uh one

2776
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:25,680
doesn't matter um in any event uh one
 

2777
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,670
doesn't matter um in any event uh one
thing i could do is take all the

2778
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:27,680
thing i could do is take all the
 

2779
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,309
thing i could do is take all the
uh triangles in my bunny and i could put

2780
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:30,319
uh triangles in my bunny and i could put
 

2781
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,630
uh triangles in my bunny and i could put
the entire bunny in a giant cube

2782
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:32,640
the entire bunny in a giant cube
 

2783
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,990
the entire bunny in a giant cube
right then with the property that the

2784
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,000
right then with the property that the
 

2785
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,390
right then with the property that the
cube is outside of my let's say i

2786
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
cube is outside of my let's say i
 

2787
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,390

can the ray touch the bunny no right

2792
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:42,319
can the ray touch the bunny no right
 

2793
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,510
can the ray touch the bunny no right
zing's right pass it

2794
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:43,520
zing's right pass it
 

2795
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,430
zing's right pass it
right so suddenly i just saved myself a

2796
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:45,440
right so suddenly i just saved myself a
 

2797
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,950
right so suddenly i just saved myself a
lot of computation time right i don't

2798
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:46,960
lot of computation time right i don't
 

2799
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,190
lot of computation time right i don't
have to iterate over all the triangles

2800
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,200
have to iterate over all the triangles
 

2801
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,630
have to iterate over all the triangles
inside of the bunny to see whether they

2802
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
inside of the bunny to see whether they
 

2803
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,470
inside of the bunny to see whether they
hit the ray or not because i already

2804
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:52,480
hit the ray or not because i already
 

2805
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,069
hit the ray or not because i already

yeah well that's sort of a nice order

2814
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,040
yeah well that's sort of a nice order
 

2815

probably not right so instead what do i

probably not right so instead what do i
do i have

do i have
 

2961
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,390
do i have
i store one instance of a chair and then

2962
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,400
i store one instance of a chair and then
 

2963
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,990
i store one instance of a chair and then
some instructions on how to tile it

2964
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,000
some instructions on how to tile it
 

2965
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,270
some instructions on how to tile it
into my entire scene so one way that i

2966
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:19,280
into my entire scene so one way that i
 

2967
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,069

can do that

2968
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
can do that
 

2969
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,990
can do that
is to think of there being a node which

2970
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
is to think of there being a node which
 

2971
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,829
is to think of there being a node which
in a graph which knows how to draw one

00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:23,839
in a graph which knows how to draw one
 

2973
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,549
in a graph which knows how to draw one
chair and now i can have a bunch of

2974
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:26,559
chair and now i can have a bunch of
 

2975
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:27,910
chair and now i can have a bunch of
different nodes in my scene for all the

2976
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
different nodes in my scene for all the
 

2977
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,510
different nodes in my scene for all the
instances of the chair that store like a

2978
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
instances of the chair that store like a
 

2979
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,910
instances of the chair that store like a
different transformation for each one

2980
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:31,920
different transformation for each one
 

2981
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,270
different transformation for each one
so what if you think about the graph

2982
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:33,280
so what if you think about the graph
 

2983
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,710
so what if you think about the graph
structure here each of those is going to

00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
really well rendering one object but
 

3055
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,270
really well rendering one object but
then you take out of the time rendering

3056
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:41,280
then you take out of the time rendering
 

3057
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,549
then you take out of the time rendering
something else

3058

something else
 

3059
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,069
something else
so there's kind of an interesting

3060
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:44,079
so there's kind of an interesting
 

3061
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,349
so there's kind of an interesting
conservation law that you have to

3062
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:45,359
conservation law that you have to
 

3063
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,790
conservation law that you have to
balance when you solve these kinds of

3064
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:46,800
balance when you solve these kinds of
 

3065
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,510

which is an interesting balance now
 

3069
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,829

proposals about other countries which is
 

3117
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,510

really interesting how they do this

3118
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,520
really interesting how they do this
 

3119
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,030
really interesting how they do this

who's likely to get elected
 

3167
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,390
who's likely to get elected
so for instance maybe there's some

00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:18,400
so for instance maybe there's some
 

3169
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,230
so for instance maybe there's some
minority i can cluster them all together

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,870
then they'll only get the opportunity to
elect one person but

elect one person but
 

3177
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,510

maybe if i divide the space where they
 

3179
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,750
maybe if i divide the space where they
live into two i could manage to engineer

3180
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
live into two i could manage to engineer
 

3181
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,549
live into two i could manage to engineer
two districts

3182

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,710
fun problems here
um so for example the state of iowa we

3202
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,720
um so for example the state of iowa we
 

3203
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,630
um so for example the state of iowa we
all pick on iowa because

3204
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
all pick on iowa because
 

3205

3213
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,470

is easier

3214
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:56,480
is easier
 

3215
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,109
is easier
but even in iowa um which is a giant

3317
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,230
the best district right so
even if p equals np you really could

3318
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240
even if p equals np you really could
 

3319
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,069
even if p equals np you really could
extract the best possible districting

3320
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:30,079
extract the best possible districting
 

3321
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,670
extract the best possible districting

3323
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,069

um it doesn't mean you have to use it at

3324
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:34,079
um it doesn't mean you have to use it at
 

3325
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,230
um it doesn't mean you have to use it at
least the way the law is written now

interestingly this is not true in

3328
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:37,599
interestingly this is not true in
 

3329
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,950
interestingly this is not true in
certain parts of mexico where they

3330
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960
certain parts of mexico where they
 

3331
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,750
certain parts of mexico where they
actually make you

3332
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:39,760
actually make you
 

3333
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,270
actually make you
compare your districting plan against

3334
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
compare your districting plan against
 

3335
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,030
compare your districting plan against
the computer-generated one which is

3336
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
the computer-generated one which is
 

3337
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,309
the computer-generated one which is
philosophically really interesting

3338
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
philosophically really interesting
 

3339
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:45,430
philosophically really interesting
although practice it doesn't work

3340
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:45,440
although practice it doesn't work
 

3341
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,829
although practice it doesn't work
terribly

3342
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:46,839
terribly
 

3343
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,390
terribly
um right so uh our research has studied

3344
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:50,400
um right so uh our research has studied
 

3345
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,309
um right so uh our research has studied
analysis of distributing plans instead

3346
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
analysis of distributing plans instead
 

3347
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,510
analysis of distributing plans instead
so instead of writing a piece of

3348
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:53,520
so instead of writing a piece of
 

3349
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,270
so instead of writing a piece of
software that takes in your state

3350
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:55,280
software that takes in your state
 

3351
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,470
software that takes in your state
draws your districts and then you're

3352
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,480
draws your districts and then you're
 

3353
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,950
draws your districts and then you're
done uh instead we ask statistical

3354
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
done uh instead we ask statistical
 

3355
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,069
done uh instead we ask statistical
questions about

3356
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
questions about
 

3357
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,750
questions about
i propose a districting plan and what

3358
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:01,760
i propose a districting plan and what
 

3359
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,750
i propose a districting plan and what
does it look like relative to the space

3360
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:03,760
does it look like relative to the space
 

3361
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,950
does it look like relative to the space
of the uh

3362
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:04,960
of the uh
 

3363
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,309
of the uh
possibilities um so that of course begs

3364
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319
possibilities um so that of course begs
 

3365
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,270
possibilities um so that of course begs
the question of what are the

3366
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:09,280
the question of what are the
 

3367
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,230
the question of what are the
possibilities

3368
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,240
possibilities
 

3369
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,750
possibilities
so these are like connected graph

3370
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
so these are like connected graph
 

3371
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,990
so these are like connected graph
partitions meaning you have a graph

3372
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,000
partitions meaning you have a graph
 

3373
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,069
partitions meaning you have a graph
and now you take the vertices and you

3374
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
and now you take the vertices and you
 

3375
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,270
and now you take the vertices and you
cluster them together

3376
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:17,280
cluster them together
 

3377
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,710
cluster them together
in a way where they're connected to one

3378
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:18,720
in a way where they're connected to one
 

3379
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,309
in a way where they're connected to one
another the one thing that we all agree

3380
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:20,319
another the one thing that we all agree
 

3381
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:20,630
another the one thing that we all agree
on

3382
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
on
 

3383
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,390
on
actually philosophically it's

3384
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:22,400
actually philosophically it's
 

3385
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,990
actually philosophically it's
questionable why um

3386
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
questionable why um
 

3387
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,349
questionable why um
is that you should be able to start at

3388
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
is that you should be able to start at
 

3389
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,030
is that you should be able to start at
any point in your district and walk to

3390
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,040
any point in your district and walk to
 

3391
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,430
any point in your district and walk to
any other one without leaving

3392
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
any other one without leaving
 

3393
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,710
any other one without leaving
these days with the internet it's not

3394
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
these days with the internet it's not
 

3395
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,549
these days with the internet it's not
clear that that's actually the best

3396
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
clear that that's actually the best
 

3397
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,470
clear that that's actually the best
criteria but that's a lot that i think

3398
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,480
criteria but that's a lot that i think
 

3399
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,870
criteria but that's a lot that i think
is never going to get passed in

3400
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:36,880
is never going to get passed in
 

3401
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,630
is never going to get passed in
in your future so anyway i think i'm out

3402
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
in your future so anyway i think i'm out
 

3403
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,750
in your future so anyway i think i'm out
of time so i don't think i'll walk you

3404
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:41,760
of time so i don't think i'll walk you
 

3405
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,630
of time so i don't think i'll walk you
guys through the

3406
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,640
guys through the
 

3407
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,950
guys through the
the theory here um if maybe i'll leave

3408
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:44,960
the theory here um if maybe i'll leave
 

3409
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,950
the theory here um if maybe i'll leave
it in the slides uh there's a

3410
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:46,960
it in the slides uh there's a
 

3411
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,030
it in the slides uh there's a
very simple proof that can show that at

3412
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,040
very simple proof that can show that at
 

3413
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,870
very simple proof that can show that at
least the very simplest thing you might

3414
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,880
least the very simplest thing you might
 

3415
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,390
least the very simplest thing you might
think of for analyzing your districting

3416
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
think of for analyzing your districting
 

3417
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,069
think of for analyzing your districting
plan which is to say

3418
00:56:54,069 --> 00:56:54,079
plan which is to say
 

3419
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,230
plan which is to say
you propose a plan and now i want your

3420
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:56,240
you propose a plan and now i want your
 

3421
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,349
you propose a plan and now i want your
plan to be at least

3422
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
plan to be at least
 

3423
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,309
plan to be at least
as good under some axis that's just a

3424
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:00,319
as good under some axis that's just a
 

3425
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,150
as good under some axis that's just a
randomly drawn one from the space of all

3426
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
randomly drawn one from the space of all
 

3427
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,750
randomly drawn one from the space of all
possible connected partitions

3428
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:03,760
possible connected partitions
 

3429
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,470
possible connected partitions
all possible ways i could draw the lines

3430
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:06,480
all possible ways i could draw the lines
 

3431
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,829
all possible ways i could draw the lines
well then it might be useful to have a

3432
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:07,839
well then it might be useful to have a
 

3433
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,670
well then it might be useful to have a
piece of software that could just

3434
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:09,680
piece of software that could just
 

3435
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,230
piece of software that could just
randomly draw such a thing so in other

3436
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
randomly draw such a thing so in other
 

3437
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,430
randomly draw such a thing so in other
words to draw something where the

3438
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
words to draw something where the
 

3439
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,109
words to draw something where the
probability of any one partition

3440
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
probability of any one partition
 

3441
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,549
probability of any one partition
is one over the number of partitions um

3442
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:18,559
is one over the number of partitions um
 

3443
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,990
is one over the number of partitions um
this seems innocent in fact actually

3444
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
this seems innocent in fact actually
 

3445
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,270
this seems innocent in fact actually
there's a number of papers that claim to

3446
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:21,280
there's a number of papers that claim to
 

3447
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,870
there's a number of papers that claim to
do things like this

3448
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
do things like this
 

3449
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,349
do things like this
but it turns out that it's a

3450
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:25,359
but it turns out that it's a
 

3451
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,630
but it turns out that it's a
computationally uh

3452
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
computationally uh
 

3453
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,309
computationally uh
difficult uh assuming that you believe

3454
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
difficult uh assuming that you believe
 

3455
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,910
difficult uh assuming that you believe
that p doesn't equal np

3456
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:29,920
that p doesn't equal np
 

3457
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,750
that p doesn't equal np
so i'll maybe leave some suggestive

3458
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
so i'll maybe leave some suggestive
 

3459
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,309
so i'll maybe leave some suggestive
pictures uh in the slides and we can

3460
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:34,319
pictures uh in the slides and we can
 

3461
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,230
pictures uh in the slides and we can
if you guys text me or during if we have

3462
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,240
if you guys text me or during if we have
 

3463
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,630

a you know professor student chat i'm

3464
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640
a you know professor student chat i'm
 

3465
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,390
a you know professor student chat i'm
happy to sketch it out to you then

3466
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:40,400
happy to sketch it out to you then
 

3467
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,789
happy to sketch it out to you then
um there's a very nice easy proof uh

3468
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:42,799
um there's a very nice easy proof uh
 

3469
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,030
um there's a very nice easy proof uh
that reduces the hamiltonian cycle

3470
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:45,040
that reduces the hamiltonian cycle
 

3471
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,870
that reduces the hamiltonian cycle
um and shows you that maybe you

3472
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
um and shows you that maybe you
 

3473
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,390
um and shows you that maybe you
shouldn't trust these tools uh

3474
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,400
shouldn't trust these tools uh
 

3475
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,910
shouldn't trust these tools uh
as much as they're argued about

3476
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:49,920
as much as they're argued about
 

3477
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,349
as much as they're argued about
literally the supreme court a couple

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,230
literally the supreme court a couple
months ago

3480
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
months ago
 

3481
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,750
months ago
by the way it was it was pretty fun like

3482
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:53,760
by the way it was it was pretty fun like
 

3483
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,990
by the way it was it was pretty fun like
our uh expert report was referenced in

3484
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,000
our uh expert report was referenced in
 

3485
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,150
our uh expert report was referenced in
the descent of the the case last summer

3486
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
the descent of the the case last summer
 

3487
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,750
the descent of the the case last summer
um and when you read the discussion like

3488
00:57:59,750 --> 00:57:59,760
um and when you read the discussion like
 

3489
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,109
um and when you read the discussion like
you can see the judges trying to talk

3490
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:01,119
you can see the judges trying to talk
 

3491
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,270
you can see the judges trying to talk
their way around complexity and

3492
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:03,280
their way around complexity and
 

3493
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,670
their way around complexity and
um it's an interesting if somewhat dry

3494
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:05,680
um it's an interesting if somewhat dry
 

3495
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,589
um it's an interesting if somewhat dry
uh read

3496
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
uh read
 

3497
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,109
uh read
so in any event that's just the starting

3498
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
so in any event that's just the starting
 

3499
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,710
so in any event that's just the starting
point for our research which says that

3500
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:10,720
point for our research which says that
 

3501
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,430
point for our research which says that
of course these

3502
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:11,440
of course these
 

3503
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,190
of course these
sampling problems are really hard and

3504
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
sampling problems are really hard and
 

3505
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,789
sampling problems are really hard and
the question is what can you do like you

3506
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:14,799
the question is what can you do like you
 

3507
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,230
the question is what can you do like you
throw the baby out with bath water or

3508
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,240
throw the baby out with bath water or
 

3509
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,430
throw the baby out with bath water or
not

3510
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:17,440
not
 

3511
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,150
not
um but the uh the real message here is

3512
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
um but the uh the real message here is
 

3513
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,109
um but the uh the real message here is
of course the

3514
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
of course the
 

3515
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,870
of course the
this course is unavoidable even in these

3516
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:22,880
this course is unavoidable even in these
 

3517
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,710
this course is unavoidable even in these
extremely applied problems showing up in

3518
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
extremely applied problems showing up in
 

3519
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,870
extremely applied problems showing up in

uh you're still complexity and

3522
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:28,880
uh you're still complexity and
 

3523
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,390
uh you're still complexity and
algorithms and data structures

3524

algorithms and data structures
 

3525
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,430
algorithms and data structures
are going to come back to play um so

3526
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
are going to come back to play um so
 

3527
