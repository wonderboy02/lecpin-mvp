00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,029
our first lecture on weighted shortest
paths

8
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
paths
 

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,509
paths
until uh now we've only been talking

10
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
until uh now we've only been talking
 

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,189
until uh now we've only been talking
about graphs that

12
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
about graphs that
 

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,470
about graphs that
uh where we measure distance in terms of

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
uh where we measure distance in terms of
 

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,589
uh where we measure distance in terms of
the number of edges

16
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
the number of edges
 

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,150
the number of edges
in a path right today we're going to

18
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
in a path right today we're going to
 

19
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,830
in a path right today we're going to
generalize that notion but i just want

20
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
generalize that notion but i just want
 

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,069
generalize that notion but i just want
to

22
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
to
 

23
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,430
to
go over what we've talked about in the

24
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
go over what we've talked about in the
 

25
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,670
go over what we've talked about in the
last two lectures uh

26
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
last two lectures uh
 

27
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,350
last two lectures uh
in the last two lectures we've talked

28
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
in the last two lectures we've talked
 

29
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,190
in the last two lectures we've talked
about two algorithms breadth first

30
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
about two algorithms breadth first
 

31
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,510
about two algorithms breadth first
search and depth first search

32
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
search and depth first search
 

33
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,270
search and depth first search
to solve a range of problems here's some

34
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
to solve a range of problems here's some
 

35
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,709
to solve a range of problems here's some
of the problems that we've

36
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
of the problems that we've
 

37
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,389
of the problems that we've
been solving single source shortest

38
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
been solving single source shortest
 

39
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,150
been solving single source shortest
paths

40
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
paths
 

41
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,630
paths
where distances are measured in number

42
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
where distances are measured in number
 

43
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,630
where distances are measured in number
of edges in a path

44
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
of edges in a path
 

45
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,189
of edges in a path
and we use bfs to solve this problem

46
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
and we use bfs to solve this problem
 

47
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,430
and we use bfs to solve this problem
starting from a single source usually a

48
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
starting from a single source usually a
 

49
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,310
starting from a single source usually a
vertex s

50
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
vertex s
 

51
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,189
vertex s
that we we call uh and and we solved

52
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
that we we call uh and and we solved
 

53
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,390
that we we call uh and and we solved
that in linear time

54
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
that in linear time
 

55
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,510
that in linear time
right and we solved that in

56
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
right and we solved that in
 

57
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,630
right and we solved that in
order v plus

58
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
order v plus
 

59
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,109
order v plus
e that's what we called linear time for

60
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
e that's what we called linear time for
 

61
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,630
e that's what we called linear time for
a graph

62
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
a graph
 

63
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,550
a graph
for the special case of single source

64
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
for the special case of single source
 

65
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,749
for the special case of single source
reachability

66
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
reachability
 

67
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,070
reachability
here we had to return a shortest path

68
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
here we had to return a shortest path
 

69
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,190
here we had to return a shortest path
distance for every vertex

70
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
distance for every vertex
 

71
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,749
distance for every vertex
and there was at most e things reachable

72
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
and there was at most e things reachable
 

73
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,109
and there was at most e things reachable
from a vertex

74
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
from a vertex
 

75
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,149
from a vertex
so this is uh

76
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
so this is uh
 

77
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,149
so this is uh
the bound we got but in the special case

78
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
the bound we got but in the special case
 

79
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,670
the bound we got but in the special case
for single source reachability

80
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
for single source reachability
 

81
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,510
for single source reachability
when our output only has to list the

82
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
when our output only has to list the
 

83
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,270
when our output only has to list the
vertices that are reachable from me

84
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
vertices that are reachable from me
 

85
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,590
vertices that are reachable from me
the the number of things reachable in a

86
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
the the number of things reachable in a
 

87
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,830
the the number of things reachable in a
uh basically a spanning tree of the

88
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
uh basically a spanning tree of the
 

89
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,149
uh basically a spanning tree of the
connected component of my source

90
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
connected component of my source
 

91
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,190
connected component of my source
can almost be of order e and so

92
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
can almost be of order e and so
 

93
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,510
can almost be of order e and so
for all the little singleton vertices in

94
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
for all the little singleton vertices in
 

95
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,630
for all the little singleton vertices in
my graph

96
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
my graph
 

97
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,670
my graph
i don't really care right so i can get

98
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
i don't really care right so i can get
 

99
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,870
i don't really care right so i can get
this in order e but that's kind of a

100
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
this in order e but that's kind of a
 

101
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,310
this in order e but that's kind of a
little optimization the next

102
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
little optimization the next
 

103
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,749
little optimization the next
thing we did was we talked about

104
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
thing we did was we talked about
 

105
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,350
thing we did was we talked about
connected components

106
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
connected components
 

107
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,150
connected components
and we didn't just reduce to using a

108
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
and we didn't just reduce to using a
 

109
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,110
and we didn't just reduce to using a
search algorithm

110
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
search algorithm
 

111
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,589
search algorithm
like a single source reachability

112
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
like a single source reachability
 

113
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,589
like a single source reachability
algorithm like bfs or dfs

114
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
algorithm like bfs or dfs
 

115
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,110
algorithm like bfs or dfs
we put a for loop around that to explore

116
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
we put a for loop around that to explore
 

117
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,110
we put a for loop around that to explore
the entire graph by basically saying if

118
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
the entire graph by basically saying if
 

119
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,430
the entire graph by basically saying if
i've

120
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
i've
 

121
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,630
i've
explored one connected component

122
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
explored one connected component
 

123
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,229
explored one connected component
then i can look at any other vertex i

124
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
then i can look at any other vertex i
 

125
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,270
then i can look at any other vertex i
haven't seen

126
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
haven't seen
 

127
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,110
haven't seen
and explore the next one right and so

128
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
and explore the next one right and so
 

129
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,750
and explore the next one right and so
that actually with some

130
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
that actually with some
 

131
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,309
that actually with some
a little analysis also got linear time

132
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
a little analysis also got linear time
 

133
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,589
a little analysis also got linear time
because i'm at most

134
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
because i'm at most
 

135
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,910
because i'm at most
traversing any component of my graph

136
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
traversing any component of my graph
 

137
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,869
traversing any component of my graph
once

138
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
once
 

139
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,750
once
that's kind of the the idea and then and

140
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
that's kind of the the idea and then and
 

141
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,350
that's kind of the the idea and then and
we can use that using

142
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
we can use that using
 

143
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,070
we can use that using
bfs or dfs really because we're just

144
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
bfs or dfs really because we're just
 

145
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,430
bfs or dfs really because we're just
trying to get

146
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
trying to get
 

147
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,030
trying to get
a thing that searches an entire

148
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
a thing that searches an entire
 

149
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,030
a thing that searches an entire
connected component

150
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
connected component
 

151
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,190
connected component
and then this topological sort we did at

152
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
and then this topological sort we did at
 

153
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,949
and then this topological sort we did at
the end of the last lecture

154
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
the end of the last lecture
 

155
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,390
the end of the last lecture
we used full dfs to give an ordering of

156
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
we used full dfs to give an ordering of
 

157
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,390
we used full dfs to give an ordering of
the vertices

158
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
the vertices
 

159
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,229
the vertices
in a dag i maybe i'll specify

160
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
in a dag i maybe i'll specify
 

161
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,030
in a dag i maybe i'll specify
clearly that this is only for a dag

162
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
clearly that this is only for a dag
 

163
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,910
clearly that this is only for a dag
right

164
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
right
 

165
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,270
right
where we uh have an ordering of the

166
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
where we uh have an ordering of the
 

167
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,430
where we uh have an ordering of the
vertices so all the edges go

168
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
vertices so all the edges go
 

169
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,869
vertices so all the edges go
forward in that order for example okay

170
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
forward in that order for example okay
 

171
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,589
forward in that order for example okay
and that we also did in linear time

172
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599

 

173
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,589

all right in this lecture and in

174
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
all right in this lecture and in
 

175
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,589
all right in this lecture and in
actually the next four lectures

176
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
actually the next four lectures
 

177
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,430
actually the next four lectures
what we're going to do is

178
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
what we're going to do is
 

179
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,750
what we're going to do is
instead of measuring distance in terms

180
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
instead of measuring distance in terms
 

181
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,589
instead of measuring distance in terms
of the number of edges in a path

182
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
of the number of edges in a path
 

183
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,270
of the number of edges in a path
so previously distance

184
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280

 

185
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,589

equaled number of edges

186
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
equaled number of edges
 

187
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,589
equaled number of edges
we're going to generalize that notion so

188
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
we're going to generalize that notion so
 

189
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,630
we're going to generalize that notion so
instead of counting

190
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
instead of counting
 

191
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,830
instead of counting
an edge we're going to count

192
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
an edge we're going to count
 

193
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,990
an edge we're going to count
an integer associated with that edge

194
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
an integer associated with that edge
 

195
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,429
an integer associated with that edge
it's going to be called a weight

196
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
it's going to be called a weight
 

197
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,589
it's going to be called a weight
all right so here's an example of a

198
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
all right so here's an example of a
 

199
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,429
all right so here's an example of a
weighted graph g and i've labeled in red

200
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
weighted graph g and i've labeled in red
 

201
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,869
weighted graph g and i've labeled in red
weights for each of these edges there's

202
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
weights for each of these edges there's
 

203
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,750
weights for each of these edges there's
a directed graph on eight vertices

204
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
a directed graph on eight vertices
 

205
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,070
a directed graph on eight vertices
and i've got a integer associated with

206
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
and i've got a integer associated with
 

207
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,509
and i've got a integer associated with
each edge you'll notice some of them

208
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
each edge you'll notice some of them
 

209
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,190
each edge you'll notice some of them
are positive some of them are negative

210
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
are positive some of them are negative
 

211
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,949
are positive some of them are negative
it's okay to be zero as well

212
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
it's okay to be zero as well
 

213
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,390
it's okay to be zero as well
it's just any integer edge weight here

214
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
it's just any integer edge weight here
 

215
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,629
it's just any integer edge weight here
so generally we're going to be along

216
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
so generally we're going to be along
 

217
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,069
so generally we're going to be along
with our graph g

218
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
with our graph g
 

219
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,830
with our graph g
we're going to be given a weight

220
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840

to we're gonna say integers

226
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
to we're gonna say integers
 

227
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,350
to we're gonna say integers
okay in this class anyway

228
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
okay in this class anyway
 

229
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,670
okay in this class anyway
uh in other contexts in mathematics you

230
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
uh in other contexts in mathematics you
 

231
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,350
uh in other contexts in mathematics you
might have this be real numbers but in

232
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
might have this be real numbers but in
 

233
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,230
might have this be real numbers but in
this class we're going to deal with

234
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
this class we're going to deal with
 

235
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,350
this class we're going to deal with
integers

236
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
integers
 

237
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,710
integers
so each edge if you have an edge

238
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
so each edge if you have an edge
 

239
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,870
so each edge if you have an edge
we're going to say this is the

240
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
we're going to say this is the
 

241
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,070
we're going to say this is the
edge weight the weight of this edge e

242
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
edge weight the weight of this edge e
 

243
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,430
edge weight the weight of this edge e
from e we we might sometimes if if this

244
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
from e we we might sometimes if if this
 

245
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,469
from e we we might sometimes if if this
edge e is u

246
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
edge e is u
 

247
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,390
edge e is u
v right we might sometimes say

248
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
v right we might sometimes say
 

249
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,749
v right we might sometimes say
the weight from u to v

250
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
the weight from u to v
 

251
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,270
the weight from u to v
since we have a simple graph that's

252
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
since we have a simple graph that's
 

253
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,790
since we have a simple graph that's
unambiguous

unambiguous
 

255
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,510
unambiguous
right all right so but this is just

256
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
right all right so but this is just
 

257
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,270
right all right so but this is just
talking about our notation so

258
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
talking about our notation so
 

259
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,150
talking about our notation so
in general for example the weight from

maybe strength of relationships in a
 

325
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,070
maybe strength of relationships in a
social network and you could imagine

326
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
social network and you could imagine
 

327
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,469
social network and you could imagine
that it's possible maybe you're

328
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
that it's possible maybe you're
 

329
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,909
that it's possible maybe you're
frenemies with someone

right like you you don't like them and

332
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
right like you you don't like them and
 

333
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,510
right like you you don't like them and
so maybe you have a negative weight

334
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
so maybe you have a negative weight
 

335
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,309
so maybe you have a negative weight

00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
maybe not but there are lots of
 

343
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,990
maybe not but there are lots of
applications where you might want

344
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
applications where you might want
 

345
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,029
applications where you might want
weights on your edges

346
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
weights on your edges
 

347
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,070
weights on your edges
so that that comes to the next question

348
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
so that that comes to the next question
 

349
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,189
so that that comes to the next question
of how do i represent how do i give

350
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
of how do i represent how do i give
 

351
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,350
of how do i represent how do i give
the user or the algorithm these weights

352
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
the user or the algorithm these weights
 

353
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,070
the user or the algorithm these weights
in my graph right we had a represent

354
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
in my graph right we had a represent
 

355
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,469
in my graph right we had a represent
representation for a graph

356
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
representation for a graph
 

357
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,029
representation for a graph
right our common way to represent a

358
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
right our common way to represent a
 

359
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,990
right our common way to represent a
graph was

360
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
graph was
 

361
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,070
graph was
store a set data structure on the

362
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
store a set data structure on the
 

363
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,189
store a set data structure on the
vertices

364
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
vertices
 

365
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,309
vertices
mapping to the adjacencies

366
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
mapping to the adjacencies
 

367
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,230
mapping to the adjacencies
of each vertex which we stored in what

368
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
of each vertex which we stored in what
 

369
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,070
of each vertex which we stored in what
we called an adjacency list which really

370
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
we called an adjacency list which really
 

371
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,230
we called an adjacency list which really
could be any data structure

372
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
could be any data structure
 

373
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,749
could be any data structure
right uh commonly it's just a

374
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
right uh commonly it's just a
 

375
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,909
right uh commonly it's just a
an array of the adjacencies but you

376
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
an array of the adjacencies but you
 

377
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,430
an array of the adjacencies but you
could also have that be

378
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
could also have that be
 

379
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,350
could also have that be
a set data structure where you can

380
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
a set data structure where you can
 

381
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,629
a set data structure where you can
query in constant time uh what

382
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
query in constant time uh what
 

383
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,790
query in constant time uh what
if a particular adjacency exists in that

384
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
if a particular adjacency exists in that
 

385
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,830
if a particular adjacency exists in that
graph

386
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
graph
 

387
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,469
graph
so a common way there are two kind of

388
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
so a common way there are two kind of
 

389
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,749
so a common way there are two kind of
common ways

390
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
common ways
 

391
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,790
common ways
to store these weights one

392
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
to store these weights one
 

393
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,909
to store these weights one
is just with every adjacency i'm going

394
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
is just with every adjacency i'm going
 

395
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,790
is just with every adjacency i'm going
to store its weight

396
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
to store its weight
 

397
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,990
to store its weight
maybe just in a tuple some you know

398
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
maybe just in a tuple some you know
 

399
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,749
maybe just in a tuple some you know
with each

400
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
with each
 

401
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,830
with each
adjacency

402
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840

 

403
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,309

also store

404
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
also store
 

405
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,110
also store
weight of the edge that it corresponds

406
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
weight of the edge that it corresponds
 

407
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,589
weight of the edge that it corresponds
to

408
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
to
 

409
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,029
to
right just in any way right uh a second

410
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
right just in any way right uh a second
 

411
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,950
right just in any way right uh a second
way

412
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
way
 

413
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,790
way
instead of trying to modify our graph

414
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
instead of trying to modify our graph
 

415
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,430
instead of trying to modify our graph
structure that we gave you before

416
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
structure that we gave you before
 

417
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,189
structure that we gave you before
let's just have a dictionary of all the

418
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
let's just have a dictionary of all the
 

419
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,869
let's just have a dictionary of all the
edges mapping to their weights

420
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
edges mapping to their weights
 

421
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,870
edges mapping to their weights
right and we already know how to do that

422
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
right and we already know how to do that
 

423
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,589
right and we already know how to do that
just so any set data structure

424
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
just so any set data structure
 

425
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,469
just so any set data structure
any separate

426
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
any separate
 

427
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,310
any separate
set data structure mapping

428
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320

 

429
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,150

edges to their i guess

430
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
edges to their i guess
 

431
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,710
edges to their i guess
weights bad notation but you get the

432
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
weights bad notation but you get the
 

433
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,509
weights bad notation but you get the
idea

434
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
idea
 

435
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,790
idea
okay and

436
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
okay and
 

437
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,150
okay and
it doesn't really matter how we're doing

438
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
it doesn't really matter how we're doing
 

439
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,590
it doesn't really matter how we're doing
this the the assumption that we're going

440
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
this the the assumption that we're going
 

441
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,110
this the the assumption that we're going
to rely on here

442
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
to rely on here
 

443
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,389
to rely on here
is that we given an edge

444
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
is that we given an edge
 

445
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,750
is that we given an edge
right given this vertex pair i can query

446
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
right given this vertex pair i can query
 

447
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:07,990
right given this vertex pair i can query
what

448
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
what
 

449
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,389
what
the weight of that edge is in constant

450
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
the weight of that edge is in constant
 

451
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,750
the weight of that edge is in constant
time right

452
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
time right
 

453
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,269
time right
and so if i'm going to do that i can

454
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
and so if i'm going to do that i can
 

455
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,949
and so if i'm going to do that i can
either store it with a

456
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
either store it with a
 

457
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,030
either store it with a
maybe a hash table of hash tables right

458
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
maybe a hash table of hash tables right
 

459
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,269
maybe a hash table of hash tables right
a hash table

460
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
a hash table
 

461
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,829
a hash table
mapping the set of vertices to their

462
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
mapping the set of vertices to their
 

463
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,190
mapping the set of vertices to their
adjacencies and then each

464
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
adjacencies and then each
 

465
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,870
adjacencies and then each
adjacency list stores its adjacencies in

466
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
adjacency list stores its adjacencies in
 

467
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,710
adjacency list stores its adjacencies in
a hash table and that way

468
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
a hash table and that way
 

469
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,389
a hash table and that way
in constant time i can check what the

470
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
in constant time i can check what the
 

471
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,670
in constant time i can check what the
weight is there or here i'm just

472
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
weight is there or here i'm just
 

473
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,190
weight is there or here i'm just
i could even have just a single hash

474
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
i could even have just a single hash
 

475
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,430
i could even have just a single hash
table mapping the pair

476
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
table mapping the pair
 

477
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,550
table mapping the pair
the the edge the tuple

478
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
the the edge the tuple
 

479
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,910
the the edge the tuple
constant size uh to its weight

480
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
constant size uh to its weight
 

481
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,790
constant size uh to its weight
right so either way is fine uh we're

482
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
right so either way is fine uh we're
 

483
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,389
right so either way is fine uh we're
just going to assume that we can

484
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
just going to assume that we can
 

485
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,030
just going to assume that we can
query an edge in constant time the

486
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
query an edge in constant time the
 

487
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,550
query an edge in constant time the
weight of an edge in constant time

488
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
weight of an edge in constant time
 

489
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,630
weight of an edge in constant time
okay so this is a that graph

490
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
okay so this is a that graph
 

491
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,350
okay so this is a that graph
example it's a little busy here i'm

492
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
example it's a little busy here i'm
 

493
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,630
example it's a little busy here i'm
probably going to erase that in just a

494
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
probably going to erase that in just a
 

495
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,790
probably going to erase that in just a
second

496
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
second
 

497
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,670
second
but we're going to move on to what

498
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
but we're going to move on to what
 

499
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,949
but we're going to move on to what
giving these edges

500
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
giving these edges
 

501
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,670
giving these edges
weights implies for uh kind of these

502
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
weights implies for uh kind of these
 

503
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,150
weights implies for uh kind of these
problems that we've defined in terms of

504
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
problems that we've defined in terms of
 

505
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,670
problems that we've defined in terms of
unweighted graphs right

506
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
unweighted graphs right
 

507
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,509
unweighted graphs right
in particular we're going to be

508
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
in particular we're going to be
 

509
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,110
in particular we're going to be
concentrating on

510
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
concentrating on
 

511
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,829
concentrating on
single source shortest paths again at

512
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
single source shortest paths again at
 

513
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,670
single source shortest paths again at
least for the next three lectures we'll

514
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
least for the next three lectures we'll
 

515
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,030
least for the next three lectures we'll
generalize that even still uh in the

516
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
generalize that even still uh in the
 

517
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,509
generalize that even still uh in the
in the next lecture i mean in the fourth

518
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
in the next lecture i mean in the fourth
 

519
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,389
in the next lecture i mean in the fourth
uh

520
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
uh
 

521
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,509
uh
in three lectures from now

522
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
in three lectures from now
 

523
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,110
in three lectures from now
but what we had here was that the

524
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
but what we had here was that the
 

525
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,550
but what we had here was that the
distance before

526
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
distance before
 

527
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,230
distance before
in an unweighted graph was the number of

528
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
in an unweighted graph was the number of
 

529
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,829
in an unweighted graph was the number of
edges in the path

530
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
edges in the path
 

531
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,430
edges in the path
here we're going to generalize that

532
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
here we're going to generalize that
 

533
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,829
here we're going to generalize that
notion kind of

534
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
notion kind of
 

535
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,509
notion kind of
obviously two weighted paths

536
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
obviously two weighted paths
 

537
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,310
obviously two weighted paths
right and the weight

538
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320

 

539
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,509

of a path i'm going to call it pi so

540
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
of a path i'm going to call it pi so
 

541
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,949
of a path i'm going to call it pi so
some weight of

542
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
some weight of
 

543
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,230
some weight of
path pi

544
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
path pi
 

545
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,350
path pi
right is just going to be the sum of the

546
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
right is just going to be the sum of the
 

547
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,630
right is just going to be the sum of the
weights in the edges in the path right

548
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
weights in the edges in the path right
 

549
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,350
weights in the edges in the path right
so

550
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
so
 

551
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,790
so
edge in the path i'm going to sum

552
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800

 

553
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,590

their weights right so that's all this

554
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
their weights right so that's all this
 

555
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,190
their weights right so that's all this
the weight of a path means it's just i'm

556
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
the weight of a path means it's just i'm
 

557
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,230
the weight of a path means it's just i'm
going to sum

558
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
going to sum
 

559
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,910
going to sum
all the weights in a path so if i took a

560
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
all the weights in a path so if i took a
 

561
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,990
all the weights in a path so if i took a
look at the maybe there's a particular

562
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
look at the maybe there's a particular
 

563
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,430
look at the maybe there's a particular
path here the path from a to b

564
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
path here the path from a to b
 

565
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,790
path here the path from a to b
to f to g right is going to be

566
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
to f to g right is going to be
 

567
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,990
to f to g right is going to be
minus 5 minus 4 2

568
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
minus 5 minus 4 2
 

569
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,990
minus 5 minus 4 2
that's going to be minus 9 plus 2 is -7

570
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
that's going to be minus 9 plus 2 is -7
 

571
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,910
that's going to be minus 9 plus 2 is -7
right okay so just as an example

572
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
right okay so just as an example
 

573
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,350
right okay so just as an example
so uh then

574
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
so uh then
 

575
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,629
so uh then
then what is the shortest path then well

576
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
then what is the shortest path then well
 

577
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,990
then what is the shortest path then well
kind of obviously among

578
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
kind of obviously among
 

579
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,710
kind of obviously among
all paths between two vertices it's

580
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
all paths between two vertices it's
 

581
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,990
all paths between two vertices it's
going to be one with the

582
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
going to be one with the
 

583
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,110
going to be one with the
minimum weight right yeah question can i

584
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
minimum weight right yeah question can i
 

585
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,030
minimum weight right yeah question can i
use the same edge more than once

586
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
use the same edge more than once
 

587
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,790
use the same edge more than once
can i use the same edge more than once

588
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
can i use the same edge more than once
 

589
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,430
can i use the same edge more than once
right now you're asking about the

590
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
right now you're asking about the
 

591
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,470
right now you're asking about the
distinction

592
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
distinction
 

593
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,829
distinction
uh in an art class which we have between

594
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
uh in an art class which we have between
 

595
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,590
uh in an art class which we have between
paths and simple paths

596
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
paths and simple paths
 

597
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,150
paths and simple paths
right so here a weighted path doesn't

598
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
right so here a weighted path doesn't
 

599
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,670
right so here a weighted path doesn't
really care if we visit an edge more

600
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
really care if we visit an edge more
 

601
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,870
really care if we visit an edge more
than once

602
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
than once
 

603
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,509
than once
right so if an edge appears more than

604
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
right so if an edge appears more than
 

605
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,069
right so if an edge appears more than
once in

606
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
once in
 

607
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,949
once in
pi we have to count that more than once

608
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
pi we have to count that more than once
 

609
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,829
pi we have to count that more than once
in the edge

610
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
in the edge
 

611
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,310
in the edge
weight in the weight of the path okay

612
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
weight in the weight of the path okay
 

613
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,590
weight in the weight of the path okay
great question

614
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
great question
 

615
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,750
great question
um but what we're going to see later on

616
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
um but what we're going to see later on
 

617
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,030
um but what we're going to see later on
is shortest paths

618
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
is shortest paths
 

619
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,030
is shortest paths
cannot repeat an edge more than once

620
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
cannot repeat an edge more than once
 

621
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,470
cannot repeat an edge more than once
uh in in certain contexts

622
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
uh in in certain contexts
 

623
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,110
uh in in certain contexts
right so so we're going to get to the

624
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
right so so we're going to get to the
 

625
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,590
right so so we're going to get to the
the

626
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
the
 

627
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,110
the
problem there a little later in this

628
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
problem there a little later in this
 

629
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,949
problem there a little later in this
lecture and we're going to solve that

630
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
lecture and we're going to solve that
 

631
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,030
lecture and we're going to solve that
in tomorrow's lecture but if you have

632
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
in tomorrow's lecture but if you have
 

633
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,990
in tomorrow's lecture but if you have
we're getting a little ahead of

634
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
we're getting a little ahead of
 

635
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,670
we're getting a little ahead of
ourselves but when we have negative

636
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
ourselves but when we have negative
 

637
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,190
ourselves but when we have negative
weights in a graph

638
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
weights in a graph
 

639
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,870
weights in a graph
it's possible that things go wrong we're

640
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
it's possible that things go wrong we're
 

641
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,870
it's possible that things go wrong we're
going to get there in about five lines

642
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
going to get there in about five lines
 

643
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,990
going to get there in about five lines
okay great so uh

644
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
okay great so uh
 

645
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,030
okay great so uh
the the shortest path

646
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040

 

647
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,790

and in this case i'm going to clarify

648
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
and in this case i'm going to clarify
 

649
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,550
and in this case i'm going to clarify
that this is the weighted shortest path

650
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
that this is the weighted shortest path
 

651
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,829
that this is the weighted shortest path
right

652
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839

 

653
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:31,590

is a minimum

654
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600

 

655
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,790

mom sure uh

656
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
mom sure uh
 

657
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,550
mom sure uh
is a minimum weight

658
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560

 

659
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,230

path you know

660
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
path you know
 

661
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,509
path you know
from s to t

662
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
from s to t
 

663
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,949
from s to t
right nothing too interesting here

664
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
right nothing too interesting here
 

665
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,949
right nothing too interesting here
but there's actually some subtleties we

666
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
but there's actually some subtleties we
 

667
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,550
but there's actually some subtleties we
have to deal with here

668
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
have to deal with here
 

669
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,750
have to deal with here
right uh we're going to call

670
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
right uh we're going to call
 

671
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,550
right uh we're going to call
just like we did with uh uh breadth

672
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
just like we did with uh uh breadth
 

673
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,750
just like we did with uh uh breadth

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
shortest paths we're going to define
 

677
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,710
shortest paths we're going to define
the uh uh an expression for what the

the uh uh an expression for what the
 

679

is between two vertices and that's going

682
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
is between two vertices and that's going
 

683
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,910
is between two vertices and that's going
to i'm going to represent that by a

684
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
to i'm going to represent that by a
 

685
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,710
to i'm going to represent that by a
delta

686
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
delta
 

687
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,990
delta
right a delta from a vertex

688
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
right a delta from a vertex
 

689
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,189
right a delta from a vertex
s to t is going to be

690
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
s to t is going to be
 

691
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,870
s to t is going to be
let's i'm going to do the wrong thing

692
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
let's i'm going to do the wrong thing
 

693
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,230
let's i'm going to do the wrong thing
first

694
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
first
 

695
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,829
first
the minimum over the weight of all paths

696
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839

 

697
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,030

for all paths pi

698
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
for all paths pi
 

699
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,470
for all paths pi
from s to

700
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
from s to
 

701
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,750
from s to
t okay

702
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
t okay
 

703
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,269
t okay
so there's a couple things that go wrong

704
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
so there's a couple things that go wrong
 

705
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,870
so there's a couple things that go wrong
here

706
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
here
 

707
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,870
here
first thing that goes wrong is the same

708
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
first thing that goes wrong is the same
 

709
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,310
first thing that goes wrong is the same
thing that went wrong

710
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
thing that went wrong
 

711
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,750
thing that went wrong
with breadth first search right anyone

712
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
with breadth first search right anyone
 

713
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,949
with breadth first search right anyone
remember what could go wrong with

714
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
remember what could go wrong with
 

715
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,990
remember what could go wrong with
breadth first search

716
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
breadth first search
 

717
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,110
breadth first search
for this delta definition maybe there's

718
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
for this delta definition maybe there's
 

719
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,910
for this delta definition maybe there's
no path

720
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
no path
 

721
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,509
no path
right right so if the in except

722
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
right right so if the in except
 

723
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,829
right right so if the in except
if no path

724
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839

 

725
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,509

just by convention we're setting uh

726
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
just by convention we're setting uh
 

727
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,790
just by convention we're setting uh
delta s t to equal

728
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
delta s t to equal
 

729
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,230
delta s t to equal
infinity but there's one additional

730
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
infinity but there's one additional
 

731
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,910
infinity but there's one additional
problem with weighted shortest paths

732
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
problem with weighted shortest paths
 

733
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,269
problem with weighted shortest paths
and it's a little subtle it's possible

734
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
and it's a little subtle it's possible
 

735
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,069
and it's a little subtle it's possible
that a finite shortest uh finite length

736
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
that a finite shortest uh finite length
 

737
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,350
that a finite shortest uh finite length
shortest path doesn't exist

738
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
shortest path doesn't exist
 

739
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,509
shortest path doesn't exist
and what do i mean by that it means uh

740
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
and what do i mean by that it means uh
 

741
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,710
and what do i mean by that it means uh
i could keep going through edges in my

742
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
i could keep going through edges in my
 

743
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,430
i could keep going through edges in my
graph

744
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
graph
 

745
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,430
graph
and continually getting a shorter

746
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
and continually getting a shorter
 

747
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,470
and continually getting a shorter
path right so if i can if the the

748
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
path right so if i can if the the
 

749
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,350
path right so if i can if the the
shortest

750
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
shortest
 

751
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,230
shortest
the minimum weight of a path from s to t

752
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
the minimum weight of a path from s to t
 

753
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,670
the minimum weight of a path from s to t
actually goes through an infinite number

754
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
actually goes through an infinite number
 

755
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,710
actually goes through an infinite number
of edges

756
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
of edges
 

757
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,550
of edges
then this isn't really well defined

758
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
then this isn't really well defined
 

759
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,990
then this isn't really well defined
right so

760
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
right so
 

761
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,310
right so
i'm going to change this minimum here to

762
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
i'm going to change this minimum here to
 

763
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,829
i'm going to change this minimum here to
in in mathematics we

764
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
in in mathematics we
 

765
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,230
in in mathematics we
just to be specific we call it an

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
just to be specific we call it an
 

767
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,030
just to be specific we call it an

768
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
infiema
 

769
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,030
infiema
right so if in the case where there

770
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
right so if in the case where there
 

771
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,829
right so if in the case where there
where

772
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
where
 

773
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,550
where
the uh the weight of a shortest path can

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
the uh the weight of a shortest path can
 

775
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,910
the uh the weight of a shortest path can
approach

776
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
approach
 

777
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,710
approach
arbitrarily small right then we'll call

778
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
arbitrarily small right then we'll call
 

779
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,670
arbitrarily small right then we'll call
this thing

780
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
this thing
 

781
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,269
this thing
minus infinity okay so

782
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
minus infinity okay so
 

783
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,030
minus infinity okay so
when does that occur

784
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040

 

785
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,949

when does that occur when could we

786
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
when does that occur when could we
 

787
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,269
when does that occur when could we
have our shortest path go through lots

788
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
have our shortest path go through lots
 

789
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,550
have our shortest path go through lots
and lots of vertices well

790
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
and lots of vertices well
 

791
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,749
and lots of vertices well
let's actually take a look at this

792
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
let's actually take a look at this
 

793
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,310
let's actually take a look at this
example here can someone tell me what

794
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
example here can someone tell me what
 

795
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,430
example here can someone tell me what
the shortest path

796
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
the shortest path
 

797
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,389
the shortest path
is from a

798
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399

 

799
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:57,269

to actually any vertex in this graph

800
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279

 

801
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,710

ah okay so well we could

802
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
ah okay so well we could
 

803
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,509
ah okay so well we could
look at this this path i have to be

804
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
look at this this path i have to be
 

805
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,789
look at this this path i have to be
let's just take a look at b

806
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
let's just take a look at b
 

807
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,590
let's just take a look at b
right i have a path going from a to b

808
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
right i have a path going from a to b
 

809
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,029
right i have a path going from a to b
that is minus five okay that's pretty

810
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
that is minus five okay that's pretty
 

811
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,150
that is minus five okay that's pretty
good that's pretty small

812
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
good that's pretty small
 

813
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,549
good that's pretty small
right and it seems that if i go

814
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
right and it seems that if i go
 

815
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,510
right and it seems that if i go
around this graph through another way it

816
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
around this graph through another way it
 

817
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,429
around this graph through another way it
might be bigger right so i go

818
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
might be bigger right so i go
 

819
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,549
might be bigger right so i go
seven plus three plus

820
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
seven plus three plus
 

821
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,150
seven plus three plus
eight that's 15 minus one that's 14

822
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
eight that's 15 minus one that's 14
 

823
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,870
eight that's 15 minus one that's 14
that's that's much bigger than my minus

824
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
that's that's much bigger than my minus
 

825
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,430
that's that's much bigger than my minus
five so

826
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
five so
 

827
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,950
five so
it seems like minus five should be good

828
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
it seems like minus five should be good
 

829
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,950
it seems like minus five should be good
right anyone have a problem with this

830
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
right anyone have a problem with this
 

831
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,669
right anyone have a problem with this
path

832
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
path
 

833
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,830

or the problem with this being the

834
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
or the problem with this being the
 

835
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,590
or the problem with this being the
shortest path

836
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
shortest path
 

837
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,390

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,549
back back to b
right this has minus four plus two

854
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
right this has minus four plus two
 

855
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,830
right this has minus four plus two
plus one minus one right so that total

856
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
plus one minus one right so that total
 

857
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,789
plus one minus one right so that total

858
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799

859
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,830

has a cycle weight

860
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
has a cycle weight
 

861
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,909
has a cycle weight
of minus two right this is negative

862
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919
of minus two right this is negative
 

863
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,590

865
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,669

so uh if i wanted to get to b

866
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
so uh if i wanted to get to b
 

867
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,669
so uh if i wanted to get to b
i could go there via this minus five

868
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
i could go there via this minus five
 

869
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,669
i could go there via this minus five

871
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,070

but every time i circled around this

872
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080

i incur -2 to my pathway
 

877
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,190
i incur -2 to my pathway
right so i just keep going around this

878
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
right so i just keep going around this
 

879
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,909
right so i just keep going around this

and i don't have any finite length

886
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000

right in in such cases we just say that

890
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
right in in such cases we just say that
 

891
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,710
right in in such cases we just say that

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
delta
 

893
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,070

is minus infinity right so uh the the

894
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
is minus infinity right so uh the the
 

895
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,950

problem here

896
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
problem here
 

897
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,669
problem here
is that uh we could have negative weight

898
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
is that uh we could have negative weight
 

899
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,190
is that uh we could have negative weight

it's a problem

908
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
it's a problem
 

909
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,430
it's a problem
in particular if

910
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,440

 

911
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,470

there exists a

912
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
there exists a
 

913
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,630
there exists a

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280

 

917
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,830

that goes

918
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840

 

919
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,310

921
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,590
through
a vertex

922
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600

 

923
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,830

927
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,430

then i can take that path to that vertex

928
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
then i can take that path to that vertex
 

929
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,149
then i can take that path to that vertex
circle around the negative weight cycle

930
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
circle around the negative weight cycle
 

931
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,149
circle around the negative weight cycle
and then proceed to v

932
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
and then proceed to v
 

933
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,830
and then proceed to v
and i can take that cycle as many times

934
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:05,840
and i can take that cycle as many times
 

935
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,430
and i can take that cycle as many times
as i want then

936
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
as i want then
 

937
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,590
as i want then

really care
 

945
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,870
really care
about what the shortest path is right

946
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
about what the shortest path is right

finite length shortest path so i'm

954
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
finite length shortest path so i'm
 

955
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,630
finite length shortest path so i'm
just going to kind of throw my hands in

956
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
just going to kind of throw my hands in
 

957
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,310
just going to kind of throw my hands in
the air and say you know what i can't

958
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
the air and say you know what i can't
 

959
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,750
the air and say you know what i can't
return you a shortest path

960
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
return you a shortest path
 

961
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,350
return you a shortest path
but i might want to return to you

962
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
but i might want to return to you
 

963
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,430
but i might want to return to you
a negative weight cycle right if you

told me that this thing has bad

966
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
told me that this thing has bad
 

967
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,630
told me that this thing has bad
weight right maybe i want you to tell me

this lecture
 

979
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,590
this lecture
we are not going to talk about that we

980
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
we are not going to talk about that we
 

981
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,710
we are not going to talk about that we
are going to talk about weighted

982
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
are going to talk about weighted
 

983
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,990
are going to talk about weighted
shortest paths though

984
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
shortest paths though
 

985
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,110
shortest paths though
that's what uh the remainder

986
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
that's what uh the remainder
 

987
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,710
that's what uh the remainder
of this uh this unit on graphs is really

988
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
of this uh this unit on graphs is really
 

989
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,870
of this uh this unit on graphs is really
about is weighted shortest paths

990
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
about is weighted shortest paths
 

991
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,990
about is weighted shortest paths
okay so in weighted shortest paths we

992
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
okay so in weighted shortest paths we
 

993
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,950
okay so in weighted shortest paths we
actually know

994
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
actually know
 

995
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,710
actually know

bfs right now

1000
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
bfs right now
 

1001
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,750
bfs right now
you're like wait jason bfs doesn't solve

1002
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
you're like wait jason bfs doesn't solve
 

1003
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,270
you're like wait jason bfs doesn't solve
weighted shortest paths we didn't even

1004
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
weighted shortest paths we didn't even
 

1005
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,990
weighted shortest paths we didn't even
know about weighted

1006
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
know about weighted
 

1007
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,630
know about weighted
graphs then right how does that solve

1008
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
graphs then right how does that solve
 

1009
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,789
graphs then right how does that solve
weighted shortest paths well

1010
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
weighted shortest paths well
 

1011
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,230
weighted shortest paths well
there's a couple cases where we might be

1012
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
there's a couple cases where we might be
 

1013
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,350
there's a couple cases where we might be
able to reduce

1014
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
able to reduce
 

1015
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,470
able to reduce
to solving shortest paths using bfs

1016
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
to solving shortest paths using bfs
 

1017
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,350
to solving shortest paths using bfs
can anyone think of such a scenario

1018
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360

 

1019
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,549

uh so let's say

1020
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
uh so let's say
 

1021
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,029
uh so let's say
i mean kind of what we did before was we

1022
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
i mean kind of what we did before was we
 

1023
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,789
i mean kind of what we did before was we
counted the number of edges

1024
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799
counted the number of edges
 

1025
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,710
counted the number of edges
right so if we gave a weight of one

1026
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
right so if we gave a weight of one
 

1027
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,110
right so if we gave a weight of one
to every edge in my graph then

1028
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
to every edge in my graph then
 

1029
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,909
to every edge in my graph then
just that graph that weighted graph

1030
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
just that graph that weighted graph
 

1031
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,669
just that graph that weighted graph
corresponds to

1032
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
corresponds to
 

1033
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,750
corresponds to
an unweighted graph using the other

1034
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
an unweighted graph using the other
 

1035
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,870
an unweighted graph using the other
distance metric

1036
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
distance metric
 

1037
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,549
distance metric
right so in that case bfs just solves

1038
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
right so in that case bfs just solves
 

1039
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,350
right so in that case bfs just solves
our problem

1040
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
our problem
 

1041
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,430
our problem
and in fact we can generalize further

1042
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
and in fact we can generalize further
 

1043
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,909
and in fact we can generalize further
what if all of our weights were positive

1044
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
what if all of our weights were positive
 

1045
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,070
what if all of our weights were positive
but the same value

1046
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
but the same value
 

1047
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,470
but the same value
right if it was all positive and the

1048
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
right if it was all positive and the
 

1049
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,630
right if it was all positive and the
same value

1050
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
same value
 

1051
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,830
same value
then we could just to you know divide by

1052
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
then we could just to you know divide by
 

1053
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,350
then we could just to you know divide by
that value

1054
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
that value
 

1055
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,110
that value
right now we have a weighted an

1056
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
right now we have a weighted an
 

1057
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,710
right now we have a weighted an

1065
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,390

later on and in fact there's one further

1066
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400

1069
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,470

which is a little bit of a tricky graph

1070

using using my weight color here
 

1093
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,390

that's like weight of four right

1094
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
that's like weight of four right
 

1095
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,549
that's like weight of four right
that's that's kind of problematic

1096

that's that's kind of problematic
 

1097
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,710
that's that's kind of problematic
because i don't know how to simulate

could
 

1105
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,350
could

i have four edges of weight one yeah i

1110
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
i have four edges of weight one yeah i
 

1111
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,950
i have four edges of weight one yeah i
can just put four edges of weight one

1112

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
the opposite of parallel okay i can just
 

1117
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,710
the opposite of parallel okay i can just
convert this

1118
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
convert this
 

1119
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,710
convert this
here into one two

1120
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720

three four edges
 

1123
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,510
three four edges
and if i do that for every edge in my

1124
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
and if i do that for every edge in my
 

1125
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,230

then that that transformation can hold

1128
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
then that that transformation can hold
 

1129
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,830
then that that transformation can hold
now that's not necessarily a good

1130
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
now that's not necessarily a good
 

1131
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,950

1135
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,110

yeah the weights might be very big

1136
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
yeah the weights might be very big
 

1137
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,350
yeah the weights might be very big
compared to the number of vertices and

today uh but but in general that that
 

1155
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,190

1194
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:24,640
graph like we were talking about
 

1195
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,230
graph like we were talking about
in the last lecture we can actually for

1196
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,240
in the last lecture we can actually for
 

1197
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,310
in the last lecture we can actually for
any set of edge weights right remember

1198
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
any set of edge weights right remember
 

1199
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,750
any set of edge weights right remember
with bfs we kind of

1200
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
with bfs we kind of
 

1201
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,350
with bfs we kind of
we needed to restrict our edge weights

1202
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
we needed to restrict our edge weights
 

1203
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,870
we needed to restrict our edge weights
to be positive

1204
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
to be positive
 

1205
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,470
to be positive
and maybe bounded to get this good

1206
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
and maybe bounded to get this good
 

1207
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,590
and maybe bounded to get this good
running time uh

1208
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
running time uh
 

1209
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,909
running time uh
for any set of edge weights if our graph

1210
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
for any set of edge weights if our graph
 

1211
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,430
for any set of edge weights if our graph
structure is a dag

1212
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
structure is a dag
 

1213
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,549
structure is a dag
really has nothing to do with the

1214
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:44,559
really has nothing to do with the
 

1215
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,510
really has nothing to do with the
weights if the graph structure is a dag

1216
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
weights if the graph structure is a dag
 

1217
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,310
weights if the graph structure is a dag
then we can actually solve this single

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
then we can actually solve this single
 

1219
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,909
then we can actually solve this single

which is pretty awesome right

1224
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
which is pretty awesome right
 

1225
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,549
which is pretty awesome right
now for general graphs

1226
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
now for general graphs
 

1227
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,630

1241
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,390

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
in something like a quadratic running
 

1243
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,549
in something like a quadratic running
time bound now this isn't the best known

1244
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:16,559
time bound now this isn't the best known
 

1245
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,470
time bound now this isn't the best known
but it's a really practical algorithm

1246
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
but it's a really practical algorithm
 

1247
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,390
but it's a really practical algorithm
and people use it all the time

1248
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
and people use it all the time
 

1249
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,590
and people use it all the time
okay and and it we're going to

1250
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
okay and and it we're going to
 

1251
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,110
okay and and it we're going to
uh show bellman ford in the context of

1252
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
uh show bellman ford in the context of
 

1253
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,630
uh show bellman ford in the context of
the dag algorithm we're going to

1254
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,640
the dag algorithm we're going to
 

1255
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,830
the dag algorithm we're going to
solve today okay so that's the very

1256
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
solve today okay so that's the very
 

1257
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,669
solve today okay so that's the very
general case in terms of restrictions on

1258
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
general case in terms of restrictions on
 

1259
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,269
general case in terms of restrictions on
our graph

1260
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:37,279
our graph
 

1261
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,470
our graph
but in reality most problems that

1262
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,480
but in reality most problems that
 

1263
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,590
but in reality most problems that
that come up in applications occur with

1264
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
that come up in applications occur with
 

1265
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,149
that come up in applications occur with
graphs

1266
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
graphs
 

1267
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,870
graphs
that have positive edge weights okay you

1268
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
that have positive edge weights okay you
 

1269
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,230
that have positive edge weights okay you
can think of a road network

1270
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
can think of a road network
 

1271
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,149
can think of a road network
you've got or non-negative ones anyway

1272
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
you've got or non-negative ones anyway
 

1273
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,230
you've got or non-negative ones anyway
right that you you're you're traveling

1274
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,240
right that you you're you're traveling
 

1275
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,350
right that you you're you're traveling
along

1276
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
along
 

1277
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,630
along
right uh and it's not ever useful to

1278
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
right uh and it's not ever useful to
 

1279
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,870
right uh and it's not ever useful to
kind of go back to where you came from

1280
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
kind of go back to where you came from
 

1281
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,190
kind of go back to where you came from
because you want to make progress to

1282
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
because you want to make progress to
 

1283
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,230
because you want to make progress to
where you're going

1284
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
where you're going
 

1285
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,350
where you're going
okay so in the context where you

1286
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360
okay so in the context where you
 

1287
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,510
okay so in the context where you
don't have negative weights you don't

1288
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
don't have negative weights you don't
 

1289
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,630
don't have negative weights you don't
have this problem where you have

1290
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,640
have this problem where you have
 

1291
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,390
have this problem where you have
negative weight cycles

1292
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,400
negative weight cycles
 

1293
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,789
negative weight cycles
we can actually do a lot better by

1294
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
we can actually do a lot better by
 

1295
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,870
we can actually do a lot better by
exploiting that property

1296
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
exploiting that property
 

1297
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,190
exploiting that property
uh and we get a bound that's a little

1298
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
uh and we get a bound that's a little
 

1299
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,750
uh and we get a bound that's a little
bit that looks a little bit more like

1300
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
bit that looks a little bit more like
 

1301
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,750
bit that looks a little bit more like
n log n right like it's it's pretty

1302
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
n log n right like it's it's pretty
 

1303
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,870
n log n right like it's it's pretty
close to linear

1304
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
close to linear
 

1305
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,750
close to linear
you're losing a log factor on the number

1306
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
you're losing a log factor on the number
 

1307
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,029
you're losing a log factor on the number
of vertices

1308
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
of vertices
 

1309
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,190
of vertices
okay but it's pretty good this is called

1310
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,200
okay but it's pretty good this is called
 

1311
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,870
okay but it's pretty good this is called
dijkstra and we'll get to that in two

1312
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
dijkstra and we'll get to that in two
 

1313
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,149
dijkstra and we'll get to that in two
lectures

1314
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:32,159
lectures
 

1315
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,950
lectures
okay so that's kind of the roadmap of

1316
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
okay so that's kind of the roadmap of
 

1317
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,389
okay so that's kind of the roadmap of
what we're going to do for at least the

1318
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,399
what we're going to do for at least the
 

1319
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,070
what we're going to do for at least the
next three lectures

1320
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080
next three lectures
 

1321
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,750
next three lectures
uh but before we go on to showing you

1322
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
uh but before we go on to showing you
 

1323
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,350
uh but before we go on to showing you
how to solve

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
right we return parent pointers back
 

1359
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,470
right we return parent pointers back
along paths to the source

1360
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
along paths to the source
 

1361
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,149
along paths to the source
along shortest paths right we called

1362
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:28,159
along shortest paths right we called
 

1363
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,149
along shortest paths right we called
this the shortest path tree so

1364
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:30,159
this the shortest path tree so
 

1365
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,830
this the shortest path tree so
i'm going to revisit this topic of

1366
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
i'm going to revisit this topic of
 

1367
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,430
i'm going to revisit this topic of
shortest paths tree

1368
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
shortest paths tree
 

1369
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,110
shortest paths tree
shortest path trees

1370
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,120

1371
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,310
shortest path trees
shortest

1372
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320

 

1373
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,149

1374
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:44,159
path trees
 

1375
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,269
path trees
okay and in particular it's kind of

1376
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
okay and in particular it's kind of
 

1377
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,149
okay and in particular it's kind of
going to be

1378
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
going to be
 

1379
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,230
going to be
annoying to talk about both of these

1380
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
annoying to talk about both of these
 

1381
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,510
annoying to talk about both of these
quantities

1382
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
quantities
 

1383
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,710
quantities
right distances and parent pointers

1384
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
right distances and parent pointers
 

1385
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,310
right distances and parent pointers
as we go through all three of these

1386
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
as we go through all three of these
 

1387
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,070
as we go through all three of these
algorithms right it's basically going to

1388
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
algorithms right it's basically going to
 

1389
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,350
algorithms right it's basically going to
be bookkeeping

1390
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
be bookkeeping
 

1391
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,789

to distances are actually sufficient for

1392
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
to distances are actually sufficient for
 

1393
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,990
to distances are actually sufficient for
us

1394
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,000
us
 

1395
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,750
us
to reconstruct parent pointers if we

1396
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
to reconstruct parent pointers if we
 

1397
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,510
to reconstruct parent pointers if we
need them later okay

1398
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,520
need them later okay
 

1399
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,430
need them later okay
so what i'm going to show for you prove

1400
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,440
so what i'm going to show for you prove
 

1401
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,510
so what i'm going to show for you prove
to you now is that if i give you

1402
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
to you now is that if i give you
 

1403
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,630
to you now is that if i give you
the shortest path distances

1404
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
the shortest path distances
 

1405
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,029

right if i'm giving you those distances

1414
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
right if i'm giving you those distances
 

1415
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,870
right if i'm giving you those distances
i can reconstruct

1416
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
i can reconstruct
 

1417
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,430
i can reconstruct
parent pointers along shortest paths in

1418
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,440

linear time

1420
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120

 

1421
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,430

for any graph i might give you if i give

1422
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,440
for any graph i might give you if i give
 

1423
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,190
for any graph i might give you if i give
you those shortest path distances

1424
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
you those shortest path distances
 

1425
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,190
you those shortest path distances
okay so that's what i'm going to try to

1426
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200
okay so that's what i'm going to try to
 

1427
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,669
okay so that's what i'm going to try to
show to you now

1428
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
show to you now
 

1429
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,870
show to you now
uh so here's the

1430
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
uh so here's the
 

1431
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,190
uh so here's the
uh algorithm

1432
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,200

 

1433
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,830

for weighted uh there's the caveat here

1434
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,840
for weighted uh there's the caveat here
 

1435
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,830
for weighted uh there's the caveat here
i'm going to write down

1436
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:52,840
i'm going to write down
 

1437
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,909
i'm going to write down
for weighted shortest paths

1438
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919

 

1439
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,029

only need

1440
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
only need
 

1441
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,430
only need
parent pointers for

1442
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,440

 

1443
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,789

v with

1444
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799
v with
 

1445
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,190
v with
a finite

1446
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200

 

1447
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,350

shortest path distance okay

1448
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,360
shortest path distance okay
 

1449
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,110
shortest path distance okay
only finite shortest path distance right

1450
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
only finite shortest path distance right
 

1451
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,470
only finite shortest path distance right
we don't care about the

1452
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
we don't care about the
 

1453
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,710
we don't care about the
infinite ones or the minus infinite ones

1454
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
infinite ones or the minus infinite ones
 

1455
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,149
infinite ones or the minus infinite ones
just the finite ones okay

1456
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:24,159
just the finite ones okay
 

1457
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,350
just the finite ones okay
so here's the algorithm i'm going to

1458
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
so here's the algorithm i'm going to
 

1459
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,789
so here's the algorithm i'm going to
initialize

1460
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799

 

1461
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,909

all pv

1462
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:33,919
all pv
 

1463
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,310
all pv
to equal uh sorry

1464
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
to equal uh sorry
 

1465
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,590
to equal uh sorry
oh

1466
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600

 

1467
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,190

getting out of myself i'm writing down

1468
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
getting out of myself i'm writing down
 

1469
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,789
getting out of myself i'm writing down
dag all right

1470
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
dag all right
 

1471
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,950
dag all right
uh init all

1472
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960

 

1473
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,789

and knit my parent pointer data

1474
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
and knit my parent pointer data
 

1475
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,269
and knit my parent pointer data
structure right

1476
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
structure right
 

1477
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,029
structure right
to be empty

1478
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039

 

1479
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,269

okay right first i'm not going to store

1480
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
okay right first i'm not going to store
 

1481
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,549
okay right first i'm not going to store
any parent pointers

1482
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:00,559
any parent pointers
 

1483
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,870
any parent pointers
but at the beginning i'm going to set

1484
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
but at the beginning i'm going to set
 

1485
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,990
but at the beginning i'm going to set
the parent pointer

1486
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
the parent pointer
 

1487
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,350
the parent pointer
of the source to be none

1488
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,360
of the source to be none
 

1489
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,230
of the source to be none
right so that's what we kind of did in

1490
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,240
right so that's what we kind of did in
 

1491
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,509
right so that's what we kind of did in
breadth first search as well

1492
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:11,519
breadth first search as well
 

1493
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,110
breadth first search as well
right now

1494
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
right now
 

1495
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,110
right now
what i've given you is i'm trying to

1496
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,120
what i've given you is i'm trying to
 

1497
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,870
what i've given you is i'm trying to
show that given all the shortest path

1498
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:18,880
show that given all the shortest path
 

1499
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,830
show that given all the shortest path
distances i can

1500
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
distances i can
 

1501
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,110
distances i can
construct these parent pointers

1502
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
construct these parent pointers
 

1503
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,990
construct these parent pointers
correctly so what i'm going to do is

1504
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
correctly so what i'm going to do is
 

1505
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,710
correctly so what i'm going to do is
for each

1506
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:28,720

 

1507
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,070

1509
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,630
vertex u
in my graph where

1510
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640

 

1511
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,149

my delta s of u

1512
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
my delta s of u
 

1513
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,389
my delta s of u
is finite

1514
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
is finite
 

1515
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,789
is finite
what am i going to do i'm going to say

1516
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799
what am i going to do i'm going to say
 

1517
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,830
what am i going to do i'm going to say
well

1518
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
well
 

1519
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,389
well
let's take a look at all my outgoing

1520
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:52,399
let's take a look at all my outgoing
 

1521
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,509
let's take a look at all my outgoing
neighbors

1522
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:53,519
neighbors
 

1523
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,750
neighbors
okay this is kind of what we do in every

1524
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:55,760
okay this is kind of what we do in every
 

1525
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,990
okay this is kind of what we do in every
graph algorithm

1526
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000

00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,240
adjacencies of

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,389
adjacencies of

1534
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:10,399

 

1535
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,710

if there's no parent pointer assigned to

1536
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
if there's no parent pointer assigned to
 

1537
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,389
if there's no parent pointer assigned to
this v

1538
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
this v
 

1539
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,750
this v
right there's the potential that i

1540
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:19,760
right there's the potential that i
 

1541
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,830
right there's the potential that i
you i you this this u this vertex u

1542
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840
you i you this this u this vertex u
 

1543
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,590
you i you this this u this vertex u
is the parent of v it's possible right

1544
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
is the parent of v it's possible right
 

1545
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,990
is the parent of v it's possible right
it's an in it's some incoming edge

1546
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
it's an in it's some incoming edge
 

1547
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,190
it's an in it's some incoming edge
to v okay when will it be an

1548
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
to v okay when will it be an
 

1549
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,389
to v okay when will it be an
incoming edge to v if i haven't said

1550
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:34,399
incoming edge to v if i haven't said
 

1551
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,070
incoming edge to v if i haven't said
if uh v

1552
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,080
if uh v
 

1553
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,509
if uh v
not in p right i haven't assigned it a

1554
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:41,519
not in p right i haven't assigned it a
 

1555
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,990
not in p right i haven't assigned it a
parent pointer

1556
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
parent pointer
 

1557
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,269
parent pointer
and so this means

1558
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
and so this means
 

1559
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,950
and so this means
it could be my parent

1560
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
it could be my parent
 

1561
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,830
it could be my parent
when is it my parent along the shortest

1562
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:54,840
when is it my parent along the shortest
 

1563
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,190
when is it my parent along the shortest
path

1564
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
path
 

1565
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,350
path
sure sum the distance along the edge

1566
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,360
sure sum the distance along the edge
 

1567
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,350
sure sum the distance along the edge
yeah so we have some edge from u to v

1568
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
yeah so we have some edge from u to v
 

1569
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,549
yeah so we have some edge from u to v
it has some weight right if i

1570
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559
it has some weight right if i
 

1571
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,389
it has some weight right if i
already know the shortest path distance

1572
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
already know the shortest path distance
 

1573
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,389
already know the shortest path distance

1577
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,110

right if

1578
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
right if
 

1579
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,789
right if
the shortest path distance from s to u

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,230
the shortest path distance from s to u
let's let's draw a picture here we've

1582
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
let's let's draw a picture here we've
 

1583
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,870
let's let's draw a picture here we've
got s we've got some path here

1584
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:24,880
got s we've got some path here
 

1585
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,909
got s we've got some path here
to u and we've got an edge

1586
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
to u and we've got an edge
 

1587
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,630
to u and we've got an edge
from u to v okay

1588
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,640

 

1589
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,909

if this shortest path distance

1590
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:35,919
if this shortest path distance
 

1591
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,389

plus this edge weight is equal to the

1592
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
plus this edge weight is equal to the
 

1593
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,070
plus this edge weight is equal to the
shortest path distance

1594
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080

1595
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,430

from s to v

1596

1597
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,509

then it better i mean there may be more

1598
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
then it better i mean there may be more
 

1599
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,110
then it better i mean there may be more
than one shortest path but this is

1600
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,120
than one shortest path but this is
 

1601
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,470
than one shortest path but this is
certainly a shortest path

1602
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
certainly a shortest path
 

1603
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,230
certainly a shortest path
so we can assign a parent pointer back

1604
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
so we can assign a parent pointer back
 

1605
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,710
so we can assign a parent pointer back
to you okay right so let's write that

1606
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
to you okay right so let's write that
 

1607
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,070
to you okay right so let's write that
condition down

1608
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,080

1617
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:09,430

and then traversing the edge from u to v

1618
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:09,440

 

1619
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,069

then then exists

1620
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:14,079
then then exists

1623
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,270

that uses

so set the parent

1630
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
so set the parent
 

1631
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,710
so set the parent
of you a v

to you okay so this is the algorithm

1634
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
to you okay so this is the algorithm
 

1635
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,869
to you okay so this is the algorithm
i'm not going to prove to you that this

1636
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:44,879
i'm not going to prove to you that this
 

1637
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,230
i'm not going to prove to you that this
is correct

1638
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
is correct
 

1639
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,230
is correct
but it kind of intuitively makes sense

1640
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
but it kind of intuitively makes sense
 

1641
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,589
but it kind of intuitively makes sense
right if i have these

1642
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
right if i have these
 

1643
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,470
right if i have these
shortest path distances right you can

1644
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:52,480
shortest path distances right you can
 

1645
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,149

00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
prove by induction that not only does
 

1647
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,190
prove by induction that not only does
this

1648
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,200
this
 

1649
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,349
this

along some shortest path here
 

1653
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,310
along some shortest path here
right but it also does so in linear time

1654
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
right but it also does so in linear time
 

1655
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,910
right but it also does so in linear time
because i'm looping over all the

both bfs and dfs essentially
 

1667
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,390

right and then since we can do this

1668
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
right and then since we can do this
 

1669
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,349
right and then since we can do this
since we can con

compute parent pointers from these

1672
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:19,839
compute parent pointers from these
 

1673
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:20,630
compute parent pointers from these

distances
 

1675

we're going to kind of ignore computing

1676
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359
we're going to kind of ignore computing
 

1677
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,270
we're going to kind of ignore computing
these parent pointers from now on

1678
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,280
these parent pointers from now on
 

1679
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,030
these parent pointers from now on
right we're just going to concentrate on

1680
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,040
right we're just going to concentrate on
 

1681
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,030
right we're just going to concentrate on
computing the distances because

1682
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,040
computing the distances because
 

1683
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,310
computing the distances because
you know we're gonna have to take linear

1684
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
you know we're gonna have to take linear
 

1685
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,550
you know we're gonna have to take linear
time anyway right

1686
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
time anyway right
 

1687
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,109
time anyway right
at least and all these other things take

1688
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:35,119
at least and all these other things take
 

1689
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,069
at least and all these other things take
more time

1690
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,079
more time
 

1691
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,550
more time
so we can compute the distances in more

1692
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:38,560
so we can compute the distances in more
 

1693
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,670
so we can compute the distances in more
time and then

1694
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:39,680
time and then
 

1695
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,710
time and then
compute the parents after okay

1696
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:42,720
compute the parents after okay
 

1697
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,310
compute the parents after okay
so that's what we're going to do

1698
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,320

 

1699
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,670

okay so now with all that build up

1700
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
okay so now with all that build up
 

1701
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,190
okay so now with all that build up
let's show an algorithm right how do we

1702
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
let's show an algorithm right how do we
 

1703
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,910
let's show an algorithm right how do we
compute shortest single source shortest

1704
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
compute shortest single source shortest
 

1705
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,990
compute shortest single source shortest
paths in a dag

1706
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
paths in a dag
 

1707
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,030
paths in a dag
in linear time okay

1708
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
in linear time okay
 

1709
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,870
in linear time okay
well a debt i mean this is actually a

1710
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
well a debt i mean this is actually a
 

1711
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,870
well a debt i mean this is actually a
super useful convenient thing

1712
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
super useful convenient thing
 

1713
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,630
super useful convenient thing
in algorithms in general dags are just

1714
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,640
in algorithms in general dags are just
 

1715
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,630
in algorithms in general dags are just
nice things right they're kind of

1716
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:10,640
nice things right they're kind of
 

1717
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,630
nice things right they're kind of
ordered in a way right there's this

1718
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,640
ordered in a way right there's this
 

1719
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,069
ordered in a way right there's this
topological sore order

1720
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:14,079
topological sore order
 

1721
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,589
topological sore order
that we were talking about before this

1722
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:15,599
that we were talking about before this
 

1723
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,510
that we were talking about before this
is going to play a key role

1724
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
is going to play a key role
 

1725
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,750
is going to play a key role
right there's a really nice structure to

1726
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
right there's a really nice structure to
 

1727
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,430
right there's a really nice structure to
dags not having cycles

1728
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,440
dags not having cycles
 

1729
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,190
dags not having cycles
not having to deal with this negative

1730
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
not having to deal with this negative
 

1731
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,630
not having to deal with this negative
weight cycle problem

1732
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,640
weight cycle problem
 

1733
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,390
weight cycle problem
right you can only kind of go in one

1734
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
right you can only kind of go in one
 

1735
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,670
right you can only kind of go in one
direction

1736
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:27,680
direction
 

1737
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,710
direction
along this graph right

1738
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:30,720
along this graph right
 

1739
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,950
along this graph right
it's very nice structure to exploit and

1740
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:32,960
it's very nice structure to exploit and
 

1741
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,670
it's very nice structure to exploit and
so we're going to exploit it

1742
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:35,680
so we're going to exploit it
 

1743
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:46,150
so we're going to exploit it
and here's the idea dag relaxation

1744
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160

 

1745
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,670

what it's going to do is it's going to

1746
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:47,680
what it's going to do is it's going to
 

1747
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,270
what it's going to do is it's going to
start out with some

1748
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
start out with some
 

1749
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,030
start out with some
estimates of what these distances should

1750
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
estimates of what these distances should
 

1751
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,710
estimates of what these distances should
be right

1752
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:52,720
be right
 

1753
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,910
be right
okay so maintain

1754
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920

 

1755
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,950

maintain distance

1756
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:00,960
maintain distance
 

1757
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,910
maintain distance
estimates

1758
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:05,920

 

1759
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,390

and now i'm going to try to be careful

1760
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
and now i'm going to try to be careful
 

1761
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,630
and now i'm going to try to be careful
here about how i draw my

1762
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,640
here about how i draw my
 

1763
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,750
here about how i draw my
d's

1764
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760

 

1765
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,589

okay this is a d

1766
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599

 

1767
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,710

this is a delta okay this is

1768
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,720
this is a delta okay this is
 

1769
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,109
this is a delta okay this is
shortest paths this is a distance

1770
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:23,119
shortest paths this is a distance
 

1771
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,390
shortest paths this is a distance
estimate

1772
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
estimate
 

1773
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,910
estimate
okay so that's what i'm going to be

1774
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920
okay so that's what i'm going to be
 

1775
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,430
okay so that's what i'm going to be
using for the the rest of this time

1776
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
using for the the rest of this time
 

1777
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,750
using for the the rest of this time
so we're going to initialize maintain

1778
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
so we're going to initialize maintain
 

1779
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,030
so we're going to initialize maintain
these

1780
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
these
 

1781
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,829
these
uh estimates of distance d which are

1782
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
uh estimates of distance d which are
 

1783
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,829
uh estimates of distance d which are
gonna start at

1784
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
gonna start at
 

1785
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,510
gonna start at
uh initially

1786
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,520
uh initially
 

1787
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,950
uh initially
infinite right okay i don't know what

1788
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:44,960
infinite right okay i don't know what
 

1789
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,589
infinite right okay i don't know what
they are

1790
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:45,599
they are
 

1791
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,790
they are
right i don't know what the shortest

1792
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800
right i don't know what the shortest
 

1793
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,829
right i don't know what the shortest
paths are but they better be less than

1794
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:48,839
paths are but they better be less than
 

1795
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,310
paths are but they better be less than
infinite

1796
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,320
infinite
 

1797
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,310
infinite
or else i don't care right so i'm going

1798
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,320
or else i don't care right so i'm going
 

1799
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,750
or else i don't care right so i'm going
to that's the kind of worst case

1800
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
to that's the kind of worst case
 

1801
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,470
to that's the kind of worst case
scenario

1802
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
scenario
 

1803
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,270
scenario
right it can't be worse than this for

1804
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,280
right it can't be worse than this for
 

1805
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,870
right it can't be worse than this for
every vertex

1806
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
every vertex
 

1807
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,470
every vertex
and we're going to maintain the property

1808
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
and we're going to maintain the property
 

1809
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,589
and we're going to maintain the property
that

1810
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:03,599

 

1811
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,150

estimates

1812
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,160

 

1813
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,870

upper bound

1814
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:14,880

 

1815
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,190

that should probably be two words upper

1816
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,200
that should probably be two words upper
 

1817
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,310
that should probably be two words upper
bound

1818
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,320
bound
 

1819
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,750
bound
uh delta sv

1820
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760

 

1821
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,310

uh we're going to maintain that the

1822
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
uh we're going to maintain that the
 

1823
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,589
uh we're going to maintain that the
upward bound this thing

1824
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:27,599
upward bound this thing
 

1825
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:34,470
upward bound this thing
and gradually lower

1826
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,480

 

1827
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,109

until they are equal

1828
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119

 

1829
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,230

okay so this is the idea we start from

1830
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,240
okay so this is the idea we start from
 

1831
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,230
okay so this is the idea we start from
an overestimate an upper bound on the

1832
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,240
an overestimate an upper bound on the
 

1833
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,390
an overestimate an upper bound on the
distance estimate and then

1834
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
distance estimate and then
 

1835
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,710
distance estimate and then
we're repeatedly going to lower that

1836
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
we're repeatedly going to lower that
 

1837
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,430
we're repeatedly going to lower that
value

1838
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
value
 

1839
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,109
value
as we gain more information about the

1840
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:51,119
as we gain more information about the
 

1841
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,950
as we gain more information about the
graph

1842
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:52,960
graph
 

1843
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,710
graph
maintaining that we're always upper

1844
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
maintaining that we're always upper
 

1845
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,630
maintaining that we're always upper
bounding the distance

1846
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
bounding the distance
 

1847
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,150
bounding the distance
and we're going to keep doing it keep

1848
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
and we're going to keep doing it keep
 

1849
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,310
and we're going to keep doing it keep
doing it keep doing it until

1850
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,320
doing it keep doing it until
 

1851
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,190
doing it keep doing it until
as we will try to prove to you these

1852
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,200
as we will try to prove to you these
 

1853
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,910
as we will try to prove to you these
estimates

1854
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:03,920
estimates
 

1855
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,230
estimates
reach actually reach down all the way to

1856
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
reach actually reach down all the way to
 

1857
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,390
reach actually reach down all the way to
our shortest path distances

1858
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
our shortest path distances
 

1859
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,670
our shortest path distances
okay so when do we lower these things

1860
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:13,680

 

1861
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,710

when do we lower these things we're

1862
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:16,720
when do we lower these things we're
 

1863
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,510
when do we lower these things we're
going to lower

1864
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:17,520
going to lower
 

1865
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,190
going to lower
these distance estimates whenever the

1866
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
these distance estimates whenever the
 

1867
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,270
these distance estimates whenever the
distance at estimates violate what we're

1868
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:21,280
distance at estimates violate what we're
 

1869
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,310
distance at estimates violate what we're
going to call

1870
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,320
going to call
 

1871
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,470
going to call
the triangle inequality okay what is the

1872
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480
the triangle inequality okay what is the
 

1873
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:36,870
the triangle inequality okay what is the
triangle inequality

1874
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:36,880

 

1875
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,550

triangle inequality is actually a pretty

1876
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:38,560
triangle inequality is actually a pretty
 

1877
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,030
triangle inequality is actually a pretty
intuitive notion

1878
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,040
intuitive notion
 

1879
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,270
intuitive notion
okay it's basically saying if i have

1880
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,280
okay it's basically saying if i have
 

1881
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,230
okay it's basically saying if i have
three points

1882
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:44,240
three points
 

1883
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,349
three points
that's thus triangle right uh

1884
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359
that's thus triangle right uh
 

1885
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,030
that's thus triangle right uh
maybe bigger so i can write a letter in

1886
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,040
maybe bigger so i can write a letter in
 

1887
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,829
maybe bigger so i can write a letter in
them

1889
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,390

okay it's basically saying that if i

1890
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,400
okay it's basically saying that if i
 

1891
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,630
okay it's basically saying that if i
have a vertex u

1892
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
have a vertex u
 

1893
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,550

distances so how we're going to do that
is

2040
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:16,720
is
 

2041
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,190
is
lower this is what we said repeatedly

2042
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
lower this is what we said repeatedly
 

2043
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,750
lower this is what we said repeatedly
lower

2044
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:19,760
lower
 

2045
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,829
lower
these distance estimates i'm going to

2046
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:21,839
these distance estimates i'm going to
 

2047
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,630
these distance estimates i'm going to
lower this guy down to equal this thing

2048
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:24,640
lower this guy down to equal this thing
 

2049
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,990
lower this guy down to equal this thing
in a sense this constraint was violated

2050
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
in a sense this constraint was violated
 

2051
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,630
in a sense this constraint was violated
but now we're relaxing that constraint

2052
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:30,640
but now we're relaxing that constraint
 

2053
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,950
but now we're relaxing that constraint
so that this is no longer violated

2054
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:32,960
so that this is no longer violated
 

2055
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,309
so that this is no longer violated
right so that's i'm

2056
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:36,319
right so that's i'm
 

2057
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,390
right so that's i'm
relaxes a little weird word here we're

2058
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:38,400
relaxes a little weird word here we're
 

2059
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,150
relaxes a little weird word here we're
using it for historical reasons

2060
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
using it for historical reasons
 

2061
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,990
using it for historical reasons
but that's what we mean by when we say

2062
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,000
but that's what we mean by when we say
 

2063
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,190
but that's what we mean by when we say
relax this thing

2064
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
relax this thing
 

2065
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,910
relax this thing
is a violated constraint it's got some

2066
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920
is a violated constraint it's got some
 

2067
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,870
is a violated constraint it's got some
pressure to be

2068
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:46,880
pressure to be
 

2069
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,589
pressure to be
resolved right and so what we're doing

2070
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
resolved right and so what we're doing
 

2071
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,589
resolved right and so what we're doing
is to resolve it we're just setting

2072
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:51,599
is to resolve it we're just setting
 

2073
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,309
is to resolve it we're just setting
this guy equal to this so it at least

2074
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:54,319
this guy equal to this so it at least
 

2075
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,990
this guy equal to this so it at least
resolves locally that constraint now it

2076
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,000
resolves locally that constraint now it
 

2077
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,390
resolves locally that constraint now it
may

2078
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
may
 

2079
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,670
may
violate the triangle inequality

2080
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
violate the triangle inequality
 

2081
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,910
violate the triangle inequality
otherwise other places

2082
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
otherwise other places
 

2083
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,750
otherwise other places
now that we've done this change but at

2084
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:01,760
now that we've done this change but at
 

2085
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,030
now that we've done this change but at
least this constraint

2086
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
least this constraint
 

2087
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,190
least this constraint
is now relaxed and satisfied okay so uh

2088
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
is now relaxed and satisfied okay so uh
 

2089
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,190
is now relaxed and satisfied okay so uh
relax

2090
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:11,200

 

2091

2093
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,030

00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:25,359
to this thing okay that's what we're
 

2099
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,349
to this thing okay that's what we're
going to mean by relaxing an edge

2100
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
going to mean by relaxing an edge
 

2101
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,790
going to mean by relaxing an edge
okay and relaxing an edge

2102
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800

 

2103
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,950

is what i'll call safe it's safe to do

2104
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:36,960
is what i'll call safe it's safe to do
 

2105
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,309
is what i'll call safe it's safe to do
okay what do i mean by relaxation is

2106
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
okay what do i mean by relaxation is
 

2107
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,309
okay what do i mean by relaxation is
safe it means that

2108
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:42,319
safe it means that
 

2109
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,790
safe it means that
as i am computing these shortest path

2110
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:44,800
as i am computing these shortest path
 

2111
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,069
as i am computing these shortest path
distances

2112
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079
distances
 

2113
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,309
distances
right i'm going to maintain this

2114
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:48,319
right i'm going to maintain this
 

2115
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,270
right i'm going to maintain this
property that

2116
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,280
property that
 

2117
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,190
property that
each one of these estimates sorry

2118
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,200
each one of these estimates sorry
 

2119
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,069
each one of these estimates sorry
these estimates here has the property

2120
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:56,079
these estimates here has the property
 

2121
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:56,870
these estimates here has the property
that it's either

2122
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:56,880
that it's either
 

2123
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,790
that it's either
infinite or it is the weight

2124
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,800
infinite or it is the weight
 

2125
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,430
infinite or it is the weight
of some path to v okay

2126
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,440
of some path to v okay
 

2127
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,950
of some path to v okay
so that's that's the thing that

2128
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
so that's that's the thing that
 

2129
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:19,829
so that's that's the thing that
relaxation is safe

2130
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
relaxation is safe
 

2131
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:24,069
relaxation is safe
so each

2132
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079

 

2133
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,910

uh distance estimate sv

2134
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:27,920
uh distance estimate sv
 

2135
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,270
uh distance estimate sv
is weight

2136
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
is weight
 

2137
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,390
is weight
of some path

2138
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:36,400

 

2139
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,470

from s to v

2140
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:40,480
from s to v
 

2141
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,710
from s to v
or infinite okay

2142
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:44,720
or infinite okay
 

2143
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,230
or infinite okay
and this is a pretty easy thing to prove

2144
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,240
and this is a pretty easy thing to prove
 

2145
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,910
and this is a pretty easy thing to prove
right if i had the invariant that

2146
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:51,920
right if i had the invariant that
 

2147
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,990
right if i had the invariant that
these were all weights of shortest paths

2148
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,000
these were all weights of shortest paths
 

2149
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,990
these were all weights of shortest paths
let's try to relax an edge

2150
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,000
let's try to relax an edge
 

2151
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,230
let's try to relax an edge
right and we need to show that this

2152
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:58,240
right and we need to show that this
 

2153
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,309
right and we need to show that this
property is maintained

2154
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:00,319
property is maintained
 

2155
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,990
property is maintained
relax edge uv okay

2156
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,000
relax edge uv okay
 

2157
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,870
relax edge uv okay
now if i relax edge uv what do i do

2158
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:08,880

 

2159
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,390

i set this thing

2160
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:12,400

 

2161
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,190

or uh sorry i set this thing my shortest

2162
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
or uh sorry i set this thing my shortest
 

2163
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:15,990
or uh sorry i set this thing my shortest
path

2164
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,000
path
 

2165
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,790

distance to v to be this thing plus this

2166
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:18,800
distance to v to be this thing plus this
 

2167
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,430
distance to v to be this thing plus this
thing

2168
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:19,440
thing
 

2169
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,510
thing
right this is an a weight of an edge

2170
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
right this is an a weight of an edge
 

2171
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,030
right this is an a weight of an edge
from u to v

2172
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,040
from u to v
 

2173
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,829
from u to v
now by my assumption that we're

2174
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:25,839
now by my assumption that we're
 

2175
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,870
now by my assumption that we're
maintaining

2176
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
maintaining
 

2177
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,470
maintaining
that this is a the weight of some path

2178
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
that this is a the weight of some path
 

2179
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,829
that this is a the weight of some path
in my graph

2180
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:31,839
in my graph
 

2181
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,950
in my graph
right if this thing is bigger

2182
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
right if this thing is bigger
 

2183
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,710
right if this thing is bigger
i'm setting it to the weight of some

2184
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:36,720
i'm setting it to the weight of some
 

2185
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,230
i'm setting it to the weight of some
path in my graph to u

2186
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,240
path in my graph to u
 

2187
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,390
path in my graph to u
plus an edge from u to v and so this

2188
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,400
plus an edge from u to v and so this
 

2189
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,790
plus an edge from u to v and so this
checks out

2190
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:42,800
checks out
 

2191
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,870
checks out
so

2192
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:46,880

 

2193
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,990

okay i i'm not going to write down all
 

2203

the argument that i just said here
 

2205
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,069
the argument that i just said here
but basically since this distance

2206
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
but basically since this distance
 

2207
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,950

was by supposition before the weight of
 

2211
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,870
was by supposition before the weight of
some path to v

2212
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
some path to v
 

2213
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,630
some path to v
to to u right then this is again

2214
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:18,640
to to u right then this is again
 

2215
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,030
to to u right then this is again
the weight of some path to v okay great

2216
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,040
the weight of some path to v okay great
 

2217
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,390
the weight of some path to v okay great
so now we're ready to

2218
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
so now we're ready to
 

2219
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,790
so now we're ready to
actually go through this algorithm

2220
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:28,800

 

2221
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,910

so dag relaxation

2222
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:31,920
so dag relaxation
 

2223
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,829
so dag relaxation
from over there

2224
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:36,839

 

2225
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,390

initializes

00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400

2227
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,829
initializes
all of our distance estimates to equal

2228
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:41,839
all of our distance estimates to equal
 

2229
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:42,630
all of our distance estimates to equal
infinity

2230
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,640

2231
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,349

just like we did in bfs

2232
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359

 

2233
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:51,270

then set

2234
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,280

 

2235
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,549

my distance estimate to myself to be

2236
00:47:54,549 --> 00:47:54,559
my distance estimate to myself to be
 

2237
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,750
my distance estimate to myself to be
zero

2238
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
zero
 

2239
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,549
zero
right now it's possible that this might

2240
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
right now it's possible that this might
 

2241
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,109
right now it's possible that this might
be

2242
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,119
be
 

2243
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,270
be
minus infinity or negative at some point

2244
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:03,280
minus infinity or negative at some point
 

2245
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,870
minus infinity or negative at some point
but right now i'm just setting it to

2246
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
but right now i'm just setting it to
 

2247
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,390
but right now i'm just setting it to
zero okay

2248
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
zero okay
 

2249
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,470
zero okay
and either way zero is going to upper

2250
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:08,480
and either way zero is going to upper
 

2251
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,030
and either way zero is going to upper
bound the distance to s

2252
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
bound the distance to s
 

2253
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,150
bound the distance to s
right so in particular

2254
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,160
right so in particular
 

2255
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,309
right so in particular
at initialization

2256
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:18,319

 

2257
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,069

anything not reachable from s

2258
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
anything not reachable from s
 

2259
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,270
anything not reachable from s
is set correctly and s

2260
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
is set correctly and s
 

2261
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,470
is set correctly and s
itself is set as an upper bound to the

2262
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,480
itself is set as an upper bound to the
 

2263
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,309
itself is set as an upper bound to the
shortest path distance okay

2264
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:30,319
shortest path distance okay
 

2265
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,230
shortest path distance okay
now we're going to process

2266
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,240
now we're going to process
 

2267
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,710
now we're going to process
each vertex

sort order
 

2275
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,950

so remember our input to dag relaxation

2276
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:52,960
so remember our input to dag relaxation
 

2277
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,150
so remember our input to dag relaxation
is a deck

2278
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:54,160
is a deck
 

2279
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,470
is a deck
so this thing has a topological sort

2280
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:56,480
so this thing has a topological sort
 

2281
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,069

00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
order is
 

2361
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,150

00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,160
when there's a path through all the
 

2363
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,710
when there's a path through all the

00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,720
vertices then there's a unique
 

2365
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,309

topological sort order

2366
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:04,319

right so it has no i mean it's shortest

2390
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:40,400
right so it has no i mean it's shortest
 

2391
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,390
right so it has no i mean it's shortest

00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,950
i'm going to initialize this to zero and

2425
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,349
can't be visited right because it's b4
in the topological order that's that's

2426
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:27,359
in the topological order that's that's
 

2427
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,430
in the topological order that's that's
the kind of the point there's no path

00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:33,599
it in the topological order
 

2433
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,710
it in the topological order
okay so

2434
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
okay so
 

2435
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,870
okay so
same with b b is before it in the

00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:38,880
same with b b is before it in the

2439
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:45,270
topological order
okay now i'm at e

2440
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:45,280
okay now i'm at e
 

2441
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,589
okay now i'm at e
and it's possible we are violating

2442
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:47,599
and it's possible we are violating
 

2443
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,790
and it's possible we are violating
triangle inequality

2444
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:48,800
triangle inequality
 

2445
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,150
triangle inequality
in particular here right i think

2446
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:52,160
in particular here right i think
 

2447
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,549
in particular here right i think
the shortest path distance to f is

2448
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
the shortest path distance to f is
 

2449
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,349
the shortest path distance to f is
infinite

2450
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
infinite
 

2451
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,190
infinite
but actually if i go to e

2452
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
but actually if i go to e
 

2453
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,230
but actually if i go to e
through this edge with

2454
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,240
through this edge with
 

2455
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,069
through this edge with
a weight 3 i know that this is violating

2456
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:06,079
a weight 3 i know that this is violating
 

2457
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,190
a weight 3 i know that this is violating
triangle inequality

2458
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:07,200
triangle inequality
 

2459
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,109
triangle inequality
so actually this thing is wrong

2460
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:11,119

 

2461
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,309

and i can set it equal to 3.

2462
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:14,319
and i can set it equal to 3.
 

2463
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,030
and i can set it equal to 3.
okay now that might not be the shortest

2464
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
okay now that might not be the shortest
 

2465
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,990
okay now that might not be the shortest
path distance

2466
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000

 

2467
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,309

but right now it's a better estimate

2468
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
but right now it's a better estimate
 

2469
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,230
but right now it's a better estimate
right so we've said it

2470
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
right so we've said it
 

2471
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,030
right so we've said it
okay now i'm moving on i'm done with

2472
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,040
okay now i'm moving on i'm done with
 

2473
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,069
okay now i'm moving on i'm done with
this guy

2474
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
this guy
 

2475
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,829
this guy
i move to the next vertex in my

2476
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:29,839
i move to the next vertex in my
 

2477
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,750
i move to the next vertex in my
topological order and again i relax

2478
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:31,760
topological order and again i relax
 

2479
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,670
topological order and again i relax
edges out of f okay so here

2480
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:35,680
edges out of f okay so here
 

2481
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,309
edges out of f okay so here
looking at eight three plus eight is

2482
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319
looking at eight three plus eight is
 

2483
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,069
looking at eight three plus eight is
better than infinite

2484
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:40,079
better than infinite
 

2485
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,790
better than infinite
so we'll say that that's eleven

2486
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:44,800

 

2487
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,549

and three plus two is better than

2488
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
and three plus two is better than
 

2489
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,150
and three plus two is better than
infinite so that's

2490
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,160
infinite so that's
 

2491
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,349
infinite so that's
five okay now i keep going in the

2492
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:51,359
five okay now i keep going in the
 

2493
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,910
five okay now i keep going in the
topological order g is the next

2494
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:53,920
topological order g is the next
 

2495
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,549
topological order g is the next
five plus one is 6. okay so we found a

2496
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:56,559
five plus one is 6. okay so we found a
 

2497
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:57,990
five plus one is 6. okay so we found a
better estimate here

2498
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
better estimate here
 

2499
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,270
better estimate here
right so this 11 is not as good

2500
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:01,280
right so this 11 is not as good
 

2501
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,309
right so this 11 is not as good
6 is better so we replace it

2502
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:04,319
6 is better so we replace it
 

2503
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,630
6 is better so we replace it
here we haven't visited before it's

2504
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640
here we haven't visited before it's
 

2505
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,750
here we haven't visited before it's
still infinite so

2506
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:07,760
still infinite so
 

2507
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,230
still infinite so
5 plus minus two is three

2508
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,240
5 plus minus two is three
 

2509
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,470
5 plus minus two is three
okay this is the next in the topological

2510
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
okay this is the next in the topological
 

2511
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,510
okay this is the next in the topological
order three

2512
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:15,520
order three
 

2513
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,069
order three
plus nine is bigger than six so that's

2514
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
plus nine is bigger than six so that's
 

2515
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,549
plus nine is bigger than six so that's
not a shorter path

2516
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:20,559
not a shorter path
 

2517
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,549
not a shorter path
three plus four is certainly smaller

2518
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:22,559
three plus four is certainly smaller
 

2519
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,069
three plus four is certainly smaller
than infinite so

2520
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
than infinite so
 

2521
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,790
than infinite so
set that equal to seven then seven plus

2522
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:26,800
set that equal to seven then seven plus
 

2523
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,190
set that equal to seven then seven plus
five

2524
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:27,200
five
 

2525
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,829
five
is also bigger than six and actually if

2526
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
is also bigger than six and actually if
 

2527
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,309
is also bigger than six and actually if
you can

2528
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:30,319
you can
 

2529
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,630
you can
you can confirm that these are all the

2530
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,640
you can confirm that these are all the
 

2531
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,309
you can confirm that these are all the
shortest path distances

2532
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:34,319
shortest path distances
 

2533
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,990
shortest path distances
from e okay so this

2534
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:38,000
from e okay so this
 

2535
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,390
from e okay so this

00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:40,400
algorithm seems to work does it actually
 

2537
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,109

work

2538
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:43,119

 

2539
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,460

so then when we processed u right

2596
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:08,160

 

2597
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,230

s to u to v

2598
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,240
s to u to v
 

2599
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,750
s to u to v
when we processed u in dag

2600
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:15,760
when we processed u in dag
 

2601
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,870
when we processed u in dag
relaxation here processed the vertex and

2602
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:18,880
relaxation here processed the vertex and
 

2603
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,349
relaxation here processed the vertex and
looked at all its outgoing adjacencies

2604
00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:21,359
looked at all its outgoing adjacencies
 

2605
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,549
looked at all its outgoing adjacencies
we would have relaxed this edge

2606
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:24,559
we would have relaxed this edge
 

2607
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,829
we would have relaxed this edge
to be no greater than that shortest path

2608
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:28,839
to be no greater than that shortest path
 

2609
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,069
to be no greater than that shortest path
distance

2610
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,079

 

2611
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,750

so this is correct you can also think of

2612
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:35,760
so this is correct you can also think of
 

2613
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,630
so this is correct you can also think of
it as

2614
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
it as

2625
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,510
distances are computed correctly already
right any shortest path distance to me

2626
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:51,520
right any shortest path distance to me
 

2627
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,190
right any shortest path distance to me
needs to be composed of a shortest path

2628

through an edge to me
 

2633
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,789
through an edge to me
so i can just check all of them that's

2634
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:00,799
so i can just check all of them that's
 

2635
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,670
