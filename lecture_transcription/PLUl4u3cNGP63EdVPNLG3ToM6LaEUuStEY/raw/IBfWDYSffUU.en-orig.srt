1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,390

we just started a new unit on graph

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
we just started a new unit on graph
 

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,589
we just started a new unit on graph
theory

4
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
theory
 

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,790
theory
which is going to be sort of our focus

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
which is going to be sort of our focus
 

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,070
which is going to be sort of our focus
for the next couple lectures uh in 6.06

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
for the next couple lectures uh in 6.06
 

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,750
for the next couple lectures uh in 6.06
uh and so i thought we'd give a little

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
uh and so i thought we'd give a little
 

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,870
uh and so i thought we'd give a little
bit of review at the beginning of

12
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880
bit of review at the beginning of
 

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,950
bit of review at the beginning of
lecture because as usual i

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
lecture because as usual i
 

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,550
lecture because as usual i
muddled together a lot of notions in our

16
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
muddled together a lot of notions in our
 

17
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,230
muddled together a lot of notions in our
previous lecture uh

18
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
previous lecture uh
 

19
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,310
previous lecture uh
and then start with some new ideas so

20
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
and then start with some new ideas so
 

21
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,830
and then start with some new ideas so
basically in our previous lecture we

22
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
basically in our previous lecture we
 

23
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,430
basically in our previous lecture we
talked about an algorithm called breadth

24
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
talked about an algorithm called breadth
 

25
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,549
talked about an algorithm called breadth
first search

26
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
first search
 

27
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,709
first search
uh and then almost always you see that

28
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
uh and then almost always you see that
 

29
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,150
uh and then almost always you see that
paired with the second algorithm called

30
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
paired with the second algorithm called
 

31
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,190
paired with the second algorithm called
depth first search

32
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
depth first search
 

33
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,750
depth first search
uh and following tradition and basically

34
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
uh and following tradition and basically
 

35
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,069
uh and following tradition and basically
logic we'll uh do the same thing uh

36
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
logic we'll uh do the same thing uh
 

37
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,029
logic we'll uh do the same thing uh
in 06 today uh but in any event for

38
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
in 06 today uh but in any event for
 

39
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,750
in 06 today uh but in any event for
today we'll

40
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
today we'll
 

41
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,310
today we'll
we'll stick to the technical material so

42
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
we'll stick to the technical material so
 

43
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,510
we'll stick to the technical material so
as a little bit of review

44
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
as a little bit of review
 

45
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,950
as a little bit of review
i guess actually the one thing i didn't

46
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
i guess actually the one thing i didn't
 

47
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,470
i guess actually the one thing i didn't
do on this slide was actually draw a

48
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
do on this slide was actually draw a
 

49
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,110
do on this slide was actually draw a
graph so

50
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
graph so
 

51
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,430
graph so
we should probably start with that uh so

52
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
we should probably start with that uh so
 

53
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,869
we should probably start with that uh so
if you recall

54
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
if you recall
 

55
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,229
if you recall
graph is a collection of nodes or

56
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
graph is a collection of nodes or
 

57
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,510
graph is a collection of nodes or
vertices depending

58
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
vertices depending
 

59
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,710
vertices depending
i don't know is it like a european

60
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
i don't know is it like a european
 

61
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,789
i don't know is it like a european
american thing or something uh

62
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
american thing or something uh
 

63
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,750
american thing or something uh
and edges right so here's an example

64
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
and edges right so here's an example
 

65
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,910
and edges right so here's an example
which as usual i'm not managing to draw

66
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:11,920
which as usual i'm not managing to draw
 

67
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,190
which as usual i'm not managing to draw
particularly clearly

68
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
particularly clearly
 

69
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,350
particularly clearly
uh so this uh graph is kind of like a

70
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
uh so this uh graph is kind of like a
 

71
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,190
uh so this uh graph is kind of like a
cycle so i have directed edges

72
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
cycle so i have directed edges
 

73
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,390
cycle so i have directed edges
here here here and here and of course uh

74
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
here here here and here and of course uh
 

75
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,910
here here here and here and of course uh
there are many kind of variations on the

76
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
there are many kind of variations on the
 

77
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,550
there are many kind of variations on the
theme

78
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
theme
 

79
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,950
theme
right so our basic uh sort of definition

80
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
right so our basic uh sort of definition
 

81
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,870
right so our basic uh sort of definition
of a graph is that we have some set

82
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
of a graph is that we have some set
 

83
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,069
of a graph is that we have some set
v which is like the set of vertices

84
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079

 

85
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,870

and then we have a set e which is set of

86
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
and then we have a set e which is set of
 

87
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,950
and then we have a set e which is set of
edges

88
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960

 

89
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,510

and this was a subset of v cross v and

90
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
and this was a subset of v cross v and
 

91
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,030
and this was a subset of v cross v and
this is nothing more than

92
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
this is nothing more than
 

93
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,510
this is nothing more than
fancy notation for saying that an edge

94
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
fancy notation for saying that an edge
 

95
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,429
fancy notation for saying that an edge
is a pair of vertices right like a from

96
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
is a pair of vertices right like a from
 

97
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,109
is a pair of vertices right like a from
and a two vertex

98
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
and a two vertex
 

99
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,230
and a two vertex
of course there are many variations on

100
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
of course there are many variations on
 

101
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,670
of course there are many variations on
this theme you could have a directed

102
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
this theme you could have a directed
 

103
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,230
this theme you could have a directed
versus an

104
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
versus an
 

105
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,630
versus an
undirected uh graph so this one is

106
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
undirected uh graph so this one is
 

107
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,270
undirected uh graph so this one is
directed

108
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
directed
 

109
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,190
directed
meaning the edges look like arrows if

110
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
meaning the edges look like arrows if
 

111
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,310
meaning the edges look like arrows if
they didn't have arrowheads they'd be

112
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
they didn't have arrowheads they'd be
 

113
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,670
they didn't have arrowheads they'd be
undirected

114
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
undirected
 

115
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,590
undirected
uh we defined something called a simple

116
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
uh we defined something called a simple
 

117
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,270
uh we defined something called a simple
graph where you have essentially no

118
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
graph where you have essentially no
 

119
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,910
graph where you have essentially no
repeated edges so for instance you can't

120
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
repeated edges so for instance you can't
 

121
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,270
repeated edges so for instance you can't
do something like this where you have

122
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
do something like this where you have
 

123
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,990
do something like this where you have
the same edge

124
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
the same edge
 

125
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,110
the same edge
twice um and then there are a couple

126
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
twice um and then there are a couple
 

127
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,470
twice um and then there are a couple
different definitions that were kind of

128
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
different definitions that were kind of
 

129
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,510
different definitions that were kind of
useful right so

130
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
useful right so
 

131
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,510
useful right so
in particular i'm gonna erase this oops

132
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
in particular i'm gonna erase this oops
 

133
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,869
in particular i'm gonna erase this oops
useless edge here maybe make my graph

134
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
useless edge here maybe make my graph
 

135
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,229
useless edge here maybe make my graph
slightly more interesting so i'll add

136
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
slightly more interesting so i'll add
 

137
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,070
slightly more interesting so i'll add
another

138
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
another
 

139
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,990
another
edge going in the reverse direction so

140
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
edge going in the reverse direction so
 

141
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,830
edge going in the reverse direction so
maybe i have um

142
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
maybe i have um
 

143
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,750
maybe i have um
i'm going to give my vertices labels x y

144
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
i'm going to give my vertices labels x y
 

145
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,229
i'm going to give my vertices labels x y
z and w then uh we talked about the uh

146
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
z and w then uh we talked about the uh
 

147
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,229
z and w then uh we talked about the uh
the neighbors of a given vertex

148
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
the neighbors of a given vertex
 

149
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,309
the neighbors of a given vertex
which are the vertices that you can

150
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
which are the vertices that you can
 

151
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,710
which are the vertices that you can
reach by following edges in or out of

152
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
reach by following edges in or out of
 

153
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,710
reach by following edges in or out of
your your vertex right so in particular

154
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
your your vertex right so in particular
 

155
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,350
your your vertex right so in particular
the outgoing neighbors uh which we sort

156
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
the outgoing neighbors uh which we sort
 

157
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,390
the outgoing neighbors uh which we sort
of implicitly

158
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
of implicitly
 

159
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,750
of implicitly
defined in our previous lecture but

160
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
defined in our previous lecture but
 

161
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,470
defined in our previous lecture but
didn't call it out um

162
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
didn't call it out um
 

163
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,509
didn't call it out um
we're going to notate with adj plus

164
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
we're going to notate with adj plus
 

165
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,949
we're going to notate with adj plus
and these are all of the things that you

166
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
and these are all of the things that you
 

167
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,949
and these are all of the things that you
can reach by going out of a

168
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
can reach by going out of a
 

169
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,190
can reach by going out of a
vertex into the next one so for example

170
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
vertex into the next one so for example
 

171
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,149
vertex into the next one so for example
uh adj

172
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
uh adj
 

173
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,110
uh adj
plus of w is going to be the set of

174
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
plus of w is going to be the set of
 

175
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,830
plus of w is going to be the set of
vertices

176
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
vertices
 

177
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,630
vertices
well notice i can get from w to y and

178
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
well notice i can get from w to y and
 

179
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,430
well notice i can get from w to y and
also from w

180
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
also from w
 

181
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,470
also from w
to z yeah so

182
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
to z yeah so
 

183
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,030
to z yeah so
oop nope y comma z

184
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
oop nope y comma z
 

185
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,470
oop nope y comma z
okay uh so to continue just our tiny

186
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
okay uh so to continue just our tiny
 

187
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,070
okay uh so to continue just our tiny
amount of review for the day

188
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
amount of review for the day
 

189
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,910
amount of review for the day
uh remember that a graph uh there are

190
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
uh remember that a graph uh there are
 

191
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,910
uh remember that a graph uh there are
many different ways to represent a graph

192
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
many different ways to represent a graph
 

193
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,430
many different ways to represent a graph
uh the sort of brain dead one will be

194
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
uh the sort of brain dead one will be
 

195
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,190
uh the sort of brain dead one will be
just like a big long list of edges but

196
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
just like a big long list of edges but
 

197
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,149
just like a big long list of edges but
of course for

198
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
of course for
 

199
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,830
of course for
our algorithms that's not a particularly

200
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
our algorithms that's not a particularly
 

201
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,190
our algorithms that's not a particularly
efficient way to check things like

202
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
efficient way to check things like
 

203
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,710
efficient way to check things like
does this edge exist in my graph uh so

204
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
does this edge exist in my graph uh so
 

205
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,470
does this edge exist in my graph uh so
the the basic representation that i

206
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
the the basic representation that i
 

207
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,830
the the basic representation that i
think we're mostly working from in this

208
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
think we're mostly working from in this
 

209
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,550
think we're mostly working from in this
course

210
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
course
 

211
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,149
course
is to think of a graph like a set of

212
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
is to think of a graph like a set of
 

213
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,229
is to think of a graph like a set of
vertices each of which

214
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
vertices each of which
 

215
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,910
vertices each of which
maps to another set of vertices so

216
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
maps to another set of vertices so
 

217
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,350
maps to another set of vertices so
roughly every vertex

218
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
roughly every vertex
 

219
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,750
roughly every vertex
maybe stores its outgoing uh set of

220
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
maybe stores its outgoing uh set of
 

221
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,949
maybe stores its outgoing uh set of
edges

222
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
edges
 

223
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,630
edges
right and and so this is kind of nice

224
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
right and and so this is kind of nice
 

225
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,869
right and and so this is kind of nice
because of course uh very quickly we can

226
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
because of course uh very quickly we can
 

227
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,830
because of course uh very quickly we can
answer questions like

228
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
answer questions like
 

229
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,229
answer questions like
is this edge inside of our graph or we

230
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
is this edge inside of our graph or we
 

231
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,509
is this edge inside of our graph or we
can iterate over the neighbors of a

232
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
can iterate over the neighbors of a
 

233
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,949
can iterate over the neighbors of a
vertex and so on which are the kind of

234
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
vertex and so on which are the kind of
 

235
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,470
vertex and so on which are the kind of
typical things that we do

236
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
typical things that we do
 

237
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,030
typical things that we do
in a lot of graph algorithms and then

238
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
in a lot of graph algorithms and then
 

239
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,910
in a lot of graph algorithms and then
finally

240
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
finally
 

241
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,670
finally
in our previous lecture we started

242
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
in our previous lecture we started
 

243
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,670
in our previous lecture we started
talking about paths right so a path

244
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
talking about paths right so a path
 

245
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,990
talking about paths right so a path
is like a chain of vertices that can get

246
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
is like a chain of vertices that can get
 

247
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,750
is like a chain of vertices that can get
me from one vertex to the other

248
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
me from one vertex to the other
 

249
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,390
me from one vertex to the other
only following edges of my graph there

250
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
only following edges of my graph there
 

251
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,590
only following edges of my graph there
was a term that

252
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
was a term that
 

253
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,110
was a term that
i think i forgot to define last time

254
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
i think i forgot to define last time
 

255
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,030
i think i forgot to define last time
because it didn't really matter a ton

256
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
because it didn't really matter a ton
 

257
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,590
because it didn't really matter a ton
which is a simple path which is just a

258
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
which is a simple path which is just a
 

259
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,030
which is a simple path which is just a
path that doesn't have the same vertex

260
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
path that doesn't have the same vertex
 

261
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,870
path that doesn't have the same vertex
more than once

262
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
more than once
 

263
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,230
more than once
uh and then of course there are many

264
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
uh and then of course there are many
 

265
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,590
uh and then of course there are many
different questions you can ask about a

266
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
different questions you can ask about a
 

267
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,870
different questions you can ask about a
graph

268
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
graph
 

269
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,150
graph
that are basically different problems

270
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
that are basically different problems
 

271
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,749
that are basically different problems
involving computing paths right so for

272
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
involving computing paths right so for
 

273
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,230
involving computing paths right so for
instance

274
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
instance
 

275
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,070
instance
the shortest path between two vertices

276
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
the shortest path between two vertices
 

277
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,350
the shortest path between two vertices
is sort of our canonical

278
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
is sort of our canonical
 

279
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,510
is sort of our canonical
one and graph theory or you could ask

280
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
one and graph theory or you could ask
 

281
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,830
one and graph theory or you could ask
questions about reachability and so on

282
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
questions about reachability and so on
 

283
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,990
questions about reachability and so on
so there's our uh our basic review from

284
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
so there's our uh our basic review from
 

285
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,350
so there's our uh our basic review from
our previous lecture

286
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
our previous lecture
 

287
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,830
our previous lecture
uh do our does our course staff have any

288
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
uh do our does our course staff have any
 

289
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,110
uh do our does our course staff have any
questions about uh

290
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
questions about uh
 

291
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,390
questions about uh
things so far excellent okay

292
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
things so far excellent okay
 

293
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,909
things so far excellent okay
and uh there's one additional piece of

294
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
and uh there's one additional piece of
 

295
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,510
and uh there's one additional piece of
terminology that i fudged a little bit

296
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
terminology that i fudged a little bit
 

297
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,230
terminology that i fudged a little bit
last time

298
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
last time
 

299
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,390
last time
or other uh my my co-instructors

300
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
or other uh my my co-instructors
 

301
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,670
or other uh my my co-instructors
suggested a bit of an attitude

302
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
suggested a bit of an attitude
 

303
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,510
suggested a bit of an attitude
adjustment so i thought i'd better uh

304
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
adjustment so i thought i'd better uh
 

305
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,350
adjustment so i thought i'd better uh
uh clarify really quick there's this

306
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
uh clarify really quick there's this
 

307
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,350
uh clarify really quick there's this
interesting phrase uh linear time which

308
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
interesting phrase uh linear time which
 

309
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,790
interesting phrase uh linear time which
we all know and love in

310
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
we all know and love in
 

311
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,350
we all know and love in
in computer science theory and and the

312
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
in computer science theory and and the
 

313
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,110
in computer science theory and and the
sort of implicit thing especially in

314
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
sort of implicit thing especially in
 

315
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,230
sort of implicit thing especially in
this course is that when we say linear

316
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
this course is that when we say linear
 

317
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,790
this course is that when we say linear
time we mean in the size of the input

318
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
time we mean in the size of the input
 

319
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,550
time we mean in the size of the input
right and so if we have a linear time

320
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
right and so if we have a linear time
 

321
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,830
right and so if we have a linear time
graph algorithm

322
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
graph algorithm
 

323
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,830
graph algorithm
well how much space does it take to

324
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
well how much space does it take to
 

325
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,510
well how much space does it take to
store a graph well we need a list of

326
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
store a graph well we need a list of
 

327
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,790
store a graph well we need a list of
vertices and a list of edges

328
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
vertices and a list of edges
 

329
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,350
vertices and a list of edges
and nothing else so a reasonable way to

330
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
and nothing else so a reasonable way to
 

331
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,510
and nothing else so a reasonable way to
interpret this phrase linear time

332
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
interpret this phrase linear time
 

333
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,029
interpret this phrase linear time
is that it's an algorithm that looks

334
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
is that it's an algorithm that looks
 

335
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,230
is that it's an algorithm that looks
like what we've shown on the screen

336
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
like what we've shown on the screen
 

337
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,710
like what we've shown on the screen
right the

338
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
right the
 

339
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,870
right the
the times proportional to maybe the sum

340
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
the times proportional to maybe the sum
 

341
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,230
the times proportional to maybe the sum
of the number of vertices and the number

342
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
of the number of vertices and the number
 

343
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,350
of the number of vertices and the number
of edges

344
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
of edges
 

345
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,870
of edges
if that makes you uncomfortable like it

346
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
if that makes you uncomfortable like it
 

347
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,469
if that makes you uncomfortable like it
does for me because one of these can

348
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
does for me because one of these can
 

349
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,830
does for me because one of these can
kind of scale on the other

350
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
kind of scale on the other
 

351
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,430
kind of scale on the other
i think it's always fine to add more

352
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
i think it's always fine to add more
 

353
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,110
i think it's always fine to add more
detail right so if you want to say

354
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
detail right so if you want to say
 

355
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,629
detail right so if you want to say
linear in the sum of the number of

356
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
linear in the sum of the number of
 

357
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,070
linear in the sum of the number of
vertices and edges that's that's

358
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
vertices and edges that's that's
 

359
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,270
vertices and edges that's that's
perfectly fine

360
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
perfectly fine
 

361
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,270
perfectly fine
but if you see this phrase that's uh how

362
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
but if you see this phrase that's uh how
 

363
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,469
but if you see this phrase that's uh how
you should interpret it

364
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
you should interpret it
 

365
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,510
you should interpret it
hopefully that's a fair way to put it

366
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
hopefully that's a fair way to put it
 

367
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,790
hopefully that's a fair way to put it
excellent okay so um

368
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
excellent okay so um
 

369
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,469
excellent okay so um
last time we talked about an algorithm

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,309
last time we talked about an algorithm
called breath first search bfs

called breath first search bfs
 

373
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,629
called breath first search bfs
for those in the know breath first

for those in the know breath first
 

375
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,469
for those in the know breath first
search uh is an algorithm

376
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
search uh is an algorithm
 

377
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,990
search uh is an algorithm
uh and and the reason we use the word

378
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
uh and and the reason we use the word
 

379
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,590
uh and and the reason we use the word
breath is because it's kind of remember

380
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
breath is because it's kind of remember
 

381
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:09,830
breath is because it's kind of remember
we

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
we
 

383
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,070
we
we talked about level sets last time uh

384
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
we talked about level sets last time uh
 

385
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,270
we talked about level sets last time uh
because we talked about breath first

386
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
because we talked about breath first

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,670
because we talked about breath first
search

388
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
search
 

389
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,590
search
in the context of computing shortest

390
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
in the context of computing shortest
 

391
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,430
in the context of computing shortest
paths uh and in particular

392
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
paths uh and in particular
 

393
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,909
paths uh and in particular
uh we have our our source uh node all

394
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
uh we have our our source uh node all
 

395
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,350
uh we have our our source uh node all
the way on the left hand side

396
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
the way on the left hand side
 

397
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,469
the way on the left hand side
and then breadth first search

398
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
and then breadth first search
 

399
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,909
and then breadth first search
constructed all the nodes that were

400
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
constructed all the nodes that were
 

401
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,110
constructed all the nodes that were
distance one away

402
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
distance one away
 

403
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,550
distance one away
right that's the first level set and

404
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
right that's the first level set and
 

405
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,309
right that's the first level set and
then all the distance two away and then

406
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
then all the distance two away and then
 

407
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,469
then all the distance two away and then
all the distance three away and so on

408
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
all the distance three away and so on
 

409
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,070
all the distance three away and so on
right so in particular like the level

410
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
right so in particular like the level
 

411
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,230
right so in particular like the level
set l3 isn't visited until we're

completely done

414
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
completely done
 

415
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,469
completely done
with level set l2 today we're going to

416
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
with level set l2 today we're going to
 

417
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,469
with level set l2 today we're going to
define another algorithm

418
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
define another algorithm
 

419
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,390
define another algorithm
which is called depth first search which

420
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
which is called depth first search which
 

421
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,150
which is called depth first search which
doesn't do that but rather

422
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
doesn't do that but rather
 

423
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,590
doesn't do that but rather
starts with the source vertex and just

424
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
starts with the source vertex and just
 

425
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,950
starts with the source vertex and just
starts walking all the way out until it

426
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
starts walking all the way out until it
 

427
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,309
starts walking all the way out until it
can't do that anymore and then kind of

428
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
can't do that anymore and then kind of
 

429
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,670
can't do that anymore and then kind of
backtracks it's one way to think about

430
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
backtracks it's one way to think about
 

431
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,469
backtracks it's one way to think about
it

432
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
it
 

433
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,189
it
uh and so somehow in breath first search

434
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
uh and so somehow in breath first search
 

435
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,749
uh and so somehow in breath first search
we're like drawing concentric circles

436
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
we're like drawing concentric circles
 

437
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,790
we're like drawing concentric circles
in depth first search we're doing the

438
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
in depth first search we're doing the
 

439
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,070
in depth first search we're doing the
opposite we're like shooting outward

440
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
opposite we're like shooting outward
 

441
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,589
opposite we're like shooting outward
until we reach the outer boundary and

442
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
until we reach the outer boundary and
 

443
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,589
until we reach the outer boundary and
then exploring a graph that way

444
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
then exploring a graph that way
 

445
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,029
then exploring a graph that way
okay and these are sort of the two

446
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
okay and these are sort of the two
 

447
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,350
okay and these are sort of the two
extremes in terms of graph search kind

448
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
extremes in terms of graph search kind
 

449
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,390
extremes in terms of graph search kind
of techniques

450
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
of techniques
 

451
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,550
of techniques
uh that are typically used under the

452
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
uh that are typically used under the
 

453
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,670
uh that are typically used under the
basic building blocks for

454
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
basic building blocks for
 

455
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,749
basic building blocks for
for algorithms and graph theory so in

456
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
for algorithms and graph theory so in
 

457
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,670
for algorithms and graph theory so in
order to motivate and think about death

458
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
order to motivate and think about death
 

459
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,390
order to motivate and think about death
for search

460
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
for search
 

461
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,390
for search
we're going to define a second problem

462
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
we're going to define a second problem
 

463
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,990
we're going to define a second problem
which is closely related to shortest

464
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
which is closely related to shortest
 

465
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,909
which is closely related to shortest
path but not exactly the same

466
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
path but not exactly the same
 

467
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,950
path but not exactly the same
and that's the reachability problem so

468
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
and that's the reachability problem so
 

469
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,270
and that's the reachability problem so
here i have the world's simplest uh

470
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
here i have the world's simplest uh
 

471
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,110
here i have the world's simplest uh
directed graph so the black things are

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
directed graph so the black things are
 

473
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,309

00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
the edges
 

475
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,790
the edges
and the circles are the uh notes or the

476
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
and the circles are the uh notes or the
 

477
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,830

and i've marked one special note in blue
 

481
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,110
and i've marked one special note in blue
uh and

482
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
uh and
 

483
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,670
uh and
his name is the source node and now the

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
his name is the source node and now the
 

485
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,430
his name is the source node and now the
question i want to ask is what are

486
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
question i want to ask is what are
 

487
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,350
question i want to ask is what are
all of the other nodes in my graph that

488
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
all of the other nodes in my graph that
 

489
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,469
all of the other nodes in my graph that
i can reach

490
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
i can reach
 

491
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,589
i can reach
by following edges directed edges

492
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
by following edges directed edges
 

493
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,430
by following edges directed edges
starting with the source right so

494
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
starting with the source right so
 

495
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,110
starting with the source right so
obviously i can get to the node in the

496
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
obviously i can get to the node in the
 

497
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,550
obviously i can get to the node in the
lower right no problem

498
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
lower right no problem
 

499
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,390
lower right no problem
and of course once i get there i can

500
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
and of course once i get there i can
 

501
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,909
and of course once i get there i can
traverse an edge

502
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
traverse an edge
 

503
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,670
traverse an edge
upward to get to that second green

notice that i was really sneaky and evil
 

509
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,950
notice that i was really sneaky and evil
and i drew edges in this graph that

510
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
and i drew edges in this graph that
 

511
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,350
and i drew edges in this graph that
might

512
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
might
 

513
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,510
might
make you think that the red note is

514
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
make you think that the red note is
 

515
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,189
make you think that the red note is
reachable the red one being on the upper

00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
reachable the red one being on the upper
 

517

uh but of course uh because all the

524
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
uh but of course uh because all the
 

525
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:11,990
uh but of course uh because all the

526
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000

527
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,670

point out i can't actually reach it

530
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
point out i can't actually reach it
 

531
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,550
point out i can't actually reach it
from the blue source node so the

532
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
from the blue source node so the
 

533
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,230
from the blue source node so the
reachability problem is just asking

534
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
reachability problem is just asking
 

535
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,670
reachability problem is just asking
which nodes can i reach

536
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
which nodes can i reach
 

537
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,150
which nodes can i reach
from a given source it's pretty

538
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
from a given source it's pretty
 

539
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,990
from a given source it's pretty
straightforward i think

540
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
straightforward i think
 

541
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,350
straightforward i think
of course there are many ways uh to

542
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
of course there are many ways uh to
 

543
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,189
of course there are many ways uh to
solve this right in fact one way we

544
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
solve this right in fact one way we
 

545
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,230
solve this right in fact one way we
could do it

546
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
could do it
 

547
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,749
could do it
uh would be to use our previous lecture

548
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
uh would be to use our previous lecture
 

549
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,750
uh would be to use our previous lecture
right we could compute the shortest path

550
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
right we could compute the shortest path
 

551
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,949
right we could compute the shortest path
distance from the source to all the

552
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
distance from the source to all the
 

553
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:35,750
distance from the source to all the
other

554
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
other
 

555
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,350
other
nodes and then what would the length of

556
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
nodes and then what would the length of
 

557
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,949
nodes and then what would the length of
the shortest path from the source to an

558
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
the shortest path from the source to an
 

559
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,389
the shortest path from the source to an
unreachable node b

560
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
unreachable node b
 

561
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,949
unreachable node b

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,470
question thinking back to our
shortest path lecture uh there are sort

572
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
shortest path lecture uh there are sort
 

573
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,150
shortest path lecture uh there are sort
of two queries we might make right one

574
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
of two queries we might make right one
 

575
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,269
of two queries we might make right one
is just what is the length of the

576
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
is just what is the length of the
 

577
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,550
is just what is the length of the
shortest path

578
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
shortest path
 

579
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,310
shortest path
the other is like what is the actual

580
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
the other is like what is the actual
 

581
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,389
the other is like what is the actual

here right which is like okay
you tell me that the green guy is

588
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
you tell me that the green guy is
 

589
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,829
you tell me that the green guy is
reachable but like how like give me a

590
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
reachable but like how like give me a
 

591
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,590
reachable but like how like give me a
path as as evidence or

592
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
path as as evidence or
 

593
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,269

about it so

596
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
about it so
 

597
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,949
about it so
uh in order to do that just like last

598
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
uh in order to do that just like last
 

599
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,630
uh in order to do that just like last
time remember we defined a particular

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
what could i do i could start with w and
 

635
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,790
what could i do i could start with w and
then just keep following those parent

636
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
then just keep following those parent
 

637
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,750
then just keep following those parent
relationships

638
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760

639
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,910

until i get back to the source then if i

640
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
until i get back to the source then if i
 

641
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,110
until i get back to the source then if i
flip the order

642
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
flip the order
 

643
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,710
flip the order
of that list of vertices i get a path

644
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
of that list of vertices i get a path
 

645
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,030
of that list of vertices i get a path
from the source to the target that's

646
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
from the source to the target that's
 

647
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,350
from the source to the target that's
valid right so this object is called a

648
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
valid right so this object is called a
 

649
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,190
valid right so this object is called a
path tree just like we talked our parent

650
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
path tree just like we talked our parent
 

651
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,069
path tree just like we talked our parent
tree rather

652
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
tree rather
 

653
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,069
tree rather
uh just like we talked about in our last

654
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
uh just like we talked about in our last
 

655
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,750
uh just like we talked about in our last
lecture uh there's no reason why this

656
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
lecture uh there's no reason why this
 

657
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,350
lecture uh there's no reason why this
thing should ever have a cycle in it

658
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
thing should ever have a cycle in it
 

659
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,710
thing should ever have a cycle in it
uh it's certainly a tree um

660
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
uh it's certainly a tree um
 

661
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,030
uh it's certainly a tree um
right so uh that's the basic

662
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
right so uh that's the basic
 

663
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,069
right so uh that's the basic
reachability problem

664
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
reachability problem
 

665
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,590
reachability problem
and in addition to that we can compute

666
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
and in addition to that we can compute
 

667
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,509
and in addition to that we can compute
this object p which is going to give me

668
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
this object p which is going to give me
 

669
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,790
this object p which is going to give me
sort of information about

670
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
sort of information about
 

671
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,030
sort of information about
how any given node was reachable there's

672
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
how any given node was reachable there's
 

673
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,710
how any given node was reachable there's
a slight difference between the parent

683
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,350
to require
that the shortest path i get or oh man

684
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
that the shortest path i get or oh man
 

685
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,110
that the shortest path i get or oh man
the path i get when i backtrack

686
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
the path i get when i backtrack
 

687
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,389
the path i get when i backtrack
along my my tree p is the shortest path

688
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
along my my tree p is the shortest path
 

689
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:40,949
along my my tree p is the shortest path
it's just

690
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
it's just
 

691
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,630
it's just
a path right because for the

692
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
a path right because for the
 

693
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,069
a path right because for the
reachability problem i actually don't

694
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
reachability problem i actually don't
 

695
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,630
reachability problem i actually don't
care

696
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
care
 

697
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,550
care
right like i could have a weird

698
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
right like i could have a weird
 

699
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,230
right like i could have a weird
circuitous crazy long path

700
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
circuitous crazy long path
 

701
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,829
circuitous crazy long path
and it still tells me that a node is

702
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
and it still tells me that a node is
 

703
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,670
and it still tells me that a node is
reachable

704
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
reachable
 

705
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,389
reachable
uh right so that's our basic setup and

706
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
uh right so that's our basic setup and
 

707
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,670
uh right so that's our basic setup and
our data structure

708
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
our data structure
 

709
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,150
our data structure
and now we can introduce a problem to to

710
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
and now we can introduce a problem to to
 

711
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,829
and now we can introduce a problem to to
solve reachability again we already have

712
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
solve reachability again we already have
 

713
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,269
solve reachability again we already have
an algorithm for doing that right which

714
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
an algorithm for doing that right which
 

715
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,110
an algorithm for doing that right which
is to compute shortest paths

716
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
is to compute shortest paths
 

717
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,870
is to compute shortest paths
and and remember that our shortest path

718
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
and and remember that our shortest path
 

719
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,470
and and remember that our shortest path

723
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,670
took linear time and the size of the
input right it took uh v

724
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
input right it took uh v
 

725
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,150
input right it took uh v
plus e time now the question is can we

726
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
plus e time now the question is can we
 

727
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,269
plus e time now the question is can we
do a little better

00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
do a little better
 

729
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,630
do a little better
the answer obviously is yes because i

730
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
the answer obviously is yes because i
 

731
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,910
the answer obviously is yes because i
just asked it and i gave you this

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
doing that
 

739
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,190
doing that
which unsurprisingly is a recursive

i'll fix it later

762
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
i'll fix it later
 

763
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,190
i'll fix it later
but in any event i'm going to mark my my

00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
but in any event i'm going to mark my my
 

765
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,870

766
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
source node
 

767
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,829
source node
and now i'm going to look at every node

768
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
and now i'm going to look at every node
 

769
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,350
and now i'm going to look at every node
every edge coming out of that node and

770
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
every edge coming out of that node and
 

771
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,949
every edge coming out of that node and
i'm going to visit it recursively

772
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
i'm going to visit it recursively
 

773
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,269
i'm going to visit it recursively
right so that's our sort of for loop

774
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
right so that's our sort of for loop

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,150
right so that's our sort of for loop

visit and then for each neighboring node

778
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
visit and then for each neighboring node
 

779
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,790

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
i'm going to say well now they do have a
 

789
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,710
i'm going to say well now they do have a

790
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720

791
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,110

and i'm going to recurse you guys see

792
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
and i'm going to recurse you guys see
 

793
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,389
and i'm going to recurse you guys see
what this is doing it's kind of crawling

794
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
what this is doing it's kind of crawling
 

795
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,230
what this is doing it's kind of crawling
outward inside of our graph so let's uh

796
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
outward inside of our graph so let's uh
 

797
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,509
outward inside of our graph so let's uh
let's let's do the example on the screen

798
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
let's let's do the example on the screen
 

799
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,269
let's let's do the example on the screen
and i purposefully designed this

800
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
and i purposefully designed this
 

801
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,430
and i purposefully designed this
experiment or this example to look a

802
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
experiment or this example to look a
 

803
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,629
experiment or this example to look a
little bit different from breath first

804
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
little bit different from breath first
 

805
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,350
little bit different from breath first
search

806
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
search
 

807
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,710
search
at least if you choose to do the

808
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
at least if you choose to do the
 

809
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,069
at least if you choose to do the
ordering that i did so here's our graph

810
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
ordering that i did so here's our graph
 

811
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,829
ordering that i did so here's our graph
one two five

812
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:31,839
one two five
 

813
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,590
one two five
three four okay and let's uh think about

814
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
three four okay and let's uh think about
 

815
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,030
three four okay and let's uh think about
the traversal order

816
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
the traversal order
 

817
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,949
the traversal order
uh that that's first search is gonna do

818
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
uh that that's first search is gonna do
 

819
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,030
uh that that's first search is gonna do
right so here's our source

820
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040

 

821
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,030

and now what does the source do it

822
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
and now what does the source do it
 

823
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,710
and now what does the source do it
record so let's think about a recursion

824
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
record so let's think about a recursion
 

825
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,190
record so let's think about a recursion
tree

826
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
tree
 

827
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,509
tree
so we have uh the source all the way up

828
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
so we have uh the source all the way up
 

829
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,310
so we have uh the source all the way up
in here

830
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
in here
 

831
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,389
in here
and now he's gonna start calling uh the

832
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
and now he's gonna start calling uh the
 

833
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,790
and now he's gonna start calling uh the
visit function recursively

834
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
visit function recursively
 

835
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,870
visit function recursively
so um and i'll go ahead and number these

836
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
so um and i'll go ahead and number these
 

837
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,710
so um and i'll go ahead and number these
the same as on the screen

838
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720

 

839
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,710

well he has one outgoing neighbor and it

840
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
well he has one outgoing neighbor and it
 

841
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,389
well he has one outgoing neighbor and it
hasn't been visited yet

842
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
hasn't been visited yet
 

843
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,750
hasn't been visited yet
so of course the very first recursive

844
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
so of course the very first recursive
 

845
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,590
so of course the very first recursive
call that i'll make is to that neighbor

846
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
call that i'll make is to that neighbor
 

847
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,030
call that i'll make is to that neighbor
too

848
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
too
 

849
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,389
too
now the neighbor two also recurses

850
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
now the neighbor two also recurses
 

851
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,910
now the neighbor two also recurses
hopefully this kind of schematic picture

852
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
hopefully this kind of schematic picture
 

853
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,110
hopefully this kind of schematic picture
makes some sense what i'm trying to draw

854
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
makes some sense what i'm trying to draw
 

855
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,550
makes some sense what i'm trying to draw
here

856
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
here
 

857
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,190
here
and well now the two has two neighbors

858
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
and well now the two has two neighbors
 

859
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,870
and well now the two has two neighbors
right a three and a five so let's say

860
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
right a three and a five so let's say
 

861
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,949
right a three and a five so let's say
that we choose three first

862
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959

 

863
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,269

well the three now recurses he calls

864
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
well the three now recurses he calls
 

865
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,710
well the three now recurses he calls
four and then the recursion tree is kind

866
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
four and then the recursion tree is kind
 

867
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,910
four and then the recursion tree is kind
of done so now it goes back

868
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
of done so now it goes back
 

869
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,389
of done so now it goes back
out and then finally well now the three

870
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
out and then finally well now the three
 

871
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,750
out and then finally well now the three
are oh boy yeah the two looks at its

872
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
are oh boy yeah the two looks at its
 

873
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,509
are oh boy yeah the two looks at its
next neighbor which is the five

874
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
next neighbor which is the five
 

875
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,990
next neighbor which is the five
uh and envisions that recursively notice

876
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
uh and envisions that recursively notice
 

877
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,710
uh and envisions that recursively notice
that this is

878
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
that this is
 

879
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,509
that this is
not following the level sets right the

880
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
not following the level sets right the
 

881
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,230
not following the level sets right the
death first

882
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
death first
 

883
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,670
death first
search algorithm got all the way to the

884
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
search algorithm got all the way to the
 

885
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,990
search algorithm got all the way to the
end of my tree in the recursive uh

886
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
end of my tree in the recursive uh
 

887
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,990
end of my tree in the recursive uh
calls and then kind of backed its way

888
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
calls and then kind of backed its way
 

889
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,150
calls and then kind of backed its way
out to the two before calling the five

890
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
out to the two before calling the five
 

891
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,750
out to the two before calling the five
these are not the same technique one

892
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
these are not the same technique one
 

893
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,430
these are not the same technique one
goes all the way to the end

894
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
goes all the way to the end
 

895
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,350
goes all the way to the end
and then kind of backtracks whereas when

896
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
and then kind of backtracks whereas when
 

897
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,550
and then kind of backtracks whereas when
i say backtrack what i mean is the

898
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
i say backtrack what i mean is the
 

899
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,470
i say backtrack what i mean is the
recursion is kind of unraveling

900
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
recursion is kind of unraveling
 

901
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,069
recursion is kind of unraveling
um whereas in breadth first search i

902
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
um whereas in breadth first search i
 

903
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,829
um whereas in breadth first search i
visit everything in one level set before

904
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
visit everything in one level set before
 

905
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,949
visit everything in one level set before
i work my way out

906
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
i work my way out
 

907
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,069
i work my way out
does that distinction make sense

908
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
does that distinction make sense
 

909
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,990
does that distinction make sense
okay so of course we need to prove that

910
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
okay so of course we need to prove that
 

911
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,150
okay so of course we need to prove that
this algorithm does something useful uh

912
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
this algorithm does something useful uh
 

913
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,069
this algorithm does something useful uh
so let's do that now so

914
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
so let's do that now so
 

915
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,790
so let's do that now so
in particular we need a correctness

916
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
in particular we need a correctness
 

917
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,269
in particular we need a correctness
proof so our claim is going to be

918
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279

 

919
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,870

that uh let's see here

920
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
that uh let's see here
 

921
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,310
that uh let's see here
the depth first search algorithm visits

922
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320

 

923
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,629

oh uh i guess reachable

924
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639

 

925
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,389

v um

926
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
v um
 

927
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,870
v um
and that it correctly sets uh the parent

928
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
and that it correctly sets uh the parent
 

929
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:55,509
and that it correctly sets uh the parent
in in the process

930
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519

 

931
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,629

um okay so

932
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
um okay so
 

933
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,110
um okay so
in order to prove this uh of course as

934
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
in order to prove this uh of course as
 

935
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,310
in order to prove this uh of course as
with almost everything in this course

936
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
with almost everything in this course
 

937
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,230
with almost everything in this course
we're going to use induction

938
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
we're going to use induction
 

939
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,230
we're going to use induction
uh and in particular what we're going to

940
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
uh and in particular what we're going to
 

941
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,509
uh and in particular what we're going to
do is

942
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
do is
 

943
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,910
do is
do induction on the distance from the

944
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
do induction on the distance from the
 

945
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,430
do induction on the distance from the
source so we're going to say that like

946
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
source so we're going to say that like
 

947
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,189
source so we're going to say that like
for all vertices in distance k

948
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
for all vertices in distance k
 

949
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,350
for all vertices in distance k
from the source this statement is true

950
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
from the source this statement is true
 

951
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,389
from the source this statement is true
and then we're going to prove this

952
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
and then we're going to prove this
 

953
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,990
and then we're going to prove this
inductively on k

954
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
inductively on k
 

955
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,069
inductively on k
okay so we want to do

956
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079

 

957
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:30,069

induction on k which is the distance

958
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079

 

959
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,269

to the source vertex so

960
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
to the source vertex so
 

961
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,269
to the source vertex so
uh as with all of our inductive proofs

962
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
uh as with all of our inductive proofs
 

963
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,470
uh as with all of our inductive proofs
we have to do our base

964
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
we have to do our base
 

965
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,790
we have to do our base
uh case and then our inductive step so

966
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
uh case and then our inductive step so
 

967
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,629
uh case and then our inductive step so
in the base case

968
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
in the base case
 

969
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,670
in the base case
k equals zero this is a hella easy case

970
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
k equals zero this is a hella easy case
 

971
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,870
k equals zero this is a hella easy case
because of course

972
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
because of course
 

973
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,030
because of course
uh what is the thing that is distance

974
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
uh what is the thing that is distance
 

975
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,910
uh what is the thing that is distance
zero from the source

976
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
zero from the source
 

977
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,550
zero from the source
it's the source yeah and take a look at

978
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
it's the source yeah and take a look at
 

979
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,990
it's the source yeah and take a look at
our our strategy all the way at the top

980
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
our our strategy all the way at the top
 

981
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,030
our our strategy all the way at the top
of this slide we explicitly set the

982
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
of this slide we explicitly set the
 

983
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,629
of this slide we explicitly set the
correct parent for the source and in

984
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
correct parent for the source and in
 

985
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,990
correct parent for the source and in
some sense visit it because

986
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
some sense visit it because
 

987
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,350
some sense visit it because
the very first thing we do is call visit

988
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
the very first thing we do is call visit
 

989
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,670
the very first thing we do is call visit
of s so there's kind of nothing to say

990
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
of s so there's kind of nothing to say
 

991
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,189
of s so there's kind of nothing to say
here yeah or there's plenty to say if

992
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
here yeah or there's plenty to say if
 

993
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,310
here yeah or there's plenty to say if
you write it on your homework

994
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
you write it on your homework
 

995
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,069
you write it on your homework
but your lazy instructor is going to

996
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
but your lazy instructor is going to
 

997
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,230
but your lazy instructor is going to
write a check mark here

998
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
write a check mark here
 

999
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,069
write a check mark here
okay so now we have to do our inductive

1000
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
okay so now we have to do our inductive
 

1001
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,829
okay so now we have to do our inductive
step

1002
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839

 

1003
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,430

so what does that mean we're going to

1004
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
so what does that mean we're going to
 

1005
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,670
so what does that mean we're going to
assume that our statement is true for

1006
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
assume that our statement is true for
 

1007
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,990
assume that our statement is true for
all nodes within a distance k and then

1008
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
all nodes within a distance k and then
 

1009
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,189
all nodes within a distance k and then
we're going to prove that our statement

1010
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
we're going to prove that our statement
 

1011
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,629
we're going to prove that our statement
is true for all nodes within a distance

1012
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
is true for all nodes within a distance
 

1013
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,150
is true for all nodes within a distance
k plus one

1014
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
k plus one
 

1015
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,189
k plus one
okay uh so uh let's do that let's

1016
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
okay uh so uh let's do that let's
 

1017
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,470
okay uh so uh let's do that let's
consider

1018
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480

 

1019
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,749

a vertex v that's

1020
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
a vertex v that's
 

1021
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,670
a vertex v that's
distance k plus one away so in other

1022
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
distance k plus one away so in other
 

1023
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,910
distance k plus one away so in other
words the distance from the source to v

1024
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
words the distance from the source to v
 

1025
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,030
words the distance from the source to v
is equal to k plus one right and what's

1026
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
is equal to k plus one right and what's
 

1027
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,550
is equal to k plus one right and what's
our goal our goal is to show that the

1028
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
our goal our goal is to show that the
 

1029
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,269
our goal our goal is to show that the
parent of v

1030
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
parent of v
 

1031
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,670
parent of v
is is set correctly yeah

1032
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680

 

1033
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,030

what's that

1034
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040

 

1035
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,269

oh sorry i forgot that the distances in

1036
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
oh sorry i forgot that the distances in
 

1037
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,550
oh sorry i forgot that the distances in
this class are ordered yeah that's

1038
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
this class are ordered yeah that's
 

1039
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,509
this class are ordered yeah that's
absolutely right so it should be the

1040
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
absolutely right so it should be the
 

1041
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,110
absolutely right so it should be the
distance from s to v

1042
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
distance from s to v
 

1043
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,309
distance from s to v
yeah sorry i'm really not used to

1044
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
yeah sorry i'm really not used to
 

1045
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,590
yeah sorry i'm really not used to
thinking about directed graphs but

1046
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
thinking about directed graphs but
 

1047
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,029
thinking about directed graphs but
that's that's

1048
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
that's that's
 

1049
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,429
that's that's
a good fix okay so uh now what can we do

1050
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
a good fix okay so uh now what can we do
 

1051
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,949
a good fix okay so uh now what can we do
well there's this number is distance

1052
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
well there's this number is distance
 

1053
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,069
well there's this number is distance
here so in particular there's some

1054
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
here so in particular there's some
 

1055
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,110
here so in particular there's some
shortest path from

1056
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
shortest path from
 

1057
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,230
shortest path from
s to v so remember our argument last

1058
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
s to v so remember our argument last
 

1059
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,949
s to v so remember our argument last
time right

1060
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
time right
 

1061
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,230
time right
that essentially when we look at

1062
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
that essentially when we look at
 

1063
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,750
that essentially when we look at
shortest path and we kind of truncate by

1064
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
shortest path and we kind of truncate by
 

1065
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,350
shortest path and we kind of truncate by
one it's still the shortest path

1066
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
one it's still the shortest path
 

1067
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,270
one it's still the shortest path
uh that property doesn't matter so much

1068
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
uh that property doesn't matter so much
 

1069
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,950
uh that property doesn't matter so much
here but at least we know that there's

1070
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
here but at least we know that there's
 

1071
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,390
here but at least we know that there's
another vertex on the path

1072
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
another vertex on the path
 

1073
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,909
another vertex on the path
which is one a distance one less

1074
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
which is one a distance one less
 

1075
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,510
which is one a distance one less
away so let's let's take you

1076
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520

 

1077
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,390

which is also a vertex to be the

1078
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
which is also a vertex to be the
 

1079
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,350
which is also a vertex to be the
previous node

1080
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360

 

1081
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,830

on the shortest path

1082
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840

 

1083
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,110

from s to v right

1084
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
from s to v right
 

1085
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,430
from s to v right
and so in particular we know that the

1086
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
and so in particular we know that the
 

1087
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,470
and so in particular we know that the
distance from s

1088
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
distance from s
 

1089
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,590
distance from s
to u is equal to k and conveniently

1090
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
to u is equal to k and conveniently
 

1091
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,669
to u is equal to k and conveniently
of course by our inductive uh hypothesis

1092
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
of course by our inductive uh hypothesis
 

1093
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,590
of course by our inductive uh hypothesis
here we know that our property is true

1094
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
here we know that our property is true
 

1095
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,750
here we know that our property is true
for this guy

1096
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
for this guy
 

1097
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,110
for this guy
okay so now our algorithm what do we

1098
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
okay so now our algorithm what do we
 

1099
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,830
okay so now our algorithm what do we
know well because our property is true

1100
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
know well because our property is true
 

1101
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,510
know well because our property is true
the visit function at some point in its

1102
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
the visit function at some point in its
 

1103
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,190
the visit function at some point in its
life is called on this vertex

1104
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
life is called on this vertex
 

1105
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,029
life is called on this vertex
u right that's sort of what our

1106
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
u right that's sort of what our
 

1107
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,549
u right that's sort of what our
induction assumes

1108
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
induction assumes
 

1109
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,150
induction assumes
so we have two cases um

1110
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
so we have two cases um
 

1111
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,669
so we have two cases um
right so uh when we uh when we visit you

1112
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
right so uh when we uh when we visit you
 

1113
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,029
right so uh when we uh when we visit you
um we know that

1114
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039

 

1115
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,549

when we call this uh uh visit function

1116
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
when we call this uh uh visit function
 

1117
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,350
when we call this uh uh visit function
well remember that v kind of by

1118
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
well remember that v kind of by
 

1119
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,750
well remember that v kind of by
definition is in adj plus of view right

1120
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
definition is in adj plus of view right
 

1121
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,710
definition is in adj plus of view right
so

1122
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
so
 

1123
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,310
so
in particular dfs is going to consider

1124
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320

 

1125
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,510

v when it gets called

1126
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
v when it gets called
 

1127
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,630
v when it gets called
okay and now there's two cases

1128
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
okay and now there's two cases
 

1129
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,350
okay and now there's two cases
right so either when this happens

1130
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
right so either when this happens
 

1131
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,350
right so either when this happens
p of v does not equal none

1132
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360

 

1133
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,350

right well what does that mean well it

1134
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
right well what does that mean well it
 

1135
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,350
right well what does that mean well it
means that we already kind of found

1136
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
means that we already kind of found
 

1137
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,830
means that we already kind of found
a suitable parent for v uh and we're in

1138
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
a suitable parent for v uh and we're in
 

1139
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,990
a suitable parent for v uh and we're in
good shape

1140
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
good shape
 

1141
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,110
good shape
otherwise p of v

1142
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120
otherwise p of v
 

1143
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,950
otherwise p of v
does equal none well in this case a very

1144
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
does equal none well in this case a very
 

1145
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,630
does equal none well in this case a very
next line of code correctly sets the

1146
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
next line of code correctly sets the
 

1147
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,350
next line of code correctly sets the
parent

1148
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
parent
 

1149
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,510
parent
and and we're all set right so in both

1150
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
and and we're all set right so in both
 

1151
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,710
and and we're all set right so in both
of these two cases

1152
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
of these two cases
 

1153
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,510
of these two cases
uh we show that the parent of uh you was

1154
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
uh we show that the parent of uh you was
 

1155
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,350
uh we show that the parent of uh you was
set correctly either by that line of

1156
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
set correctly either by that line of
 

1157
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,190
set correctly either by that line of
code right here or just previously

1158
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
code right here or just previously
 

1159
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,430
code right here or just previously
uh and and so in either case our our

1160
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
uh and and so in either case our our
 

1161
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,990
uh and and so in either case our our
induction is done

1162
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
induction is done
 

1163
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,470
induction is done
all right i guess uh given the feedback

1164
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
all right i guess uh given the feedback
 

1165
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,990
all right i guess uh given the feedback
i received from our previous lecture

1166
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
i received from our previous lecture
 

1167
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,909
i received from our previous lecture
we now can and end our latex uh suitably

1168
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
we now can and end our latex uh suitably
 

1169
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,990
we now can and end our latex uh suitably
okay so what did we just show we showed

1170
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
okay so what did we just show we showed
 

1171
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,150
okay so what did we just show we showed
that the death first search algorithm

1172
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
that the death first search algorithm
 

1173
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,390
that the death first search algorithm
can dig around in a graph and tell me

1174
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
can dig around in a graph and tell me
 

1175
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,590
can dig around in a graph and tell me
all of the things that are

1176
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
all of the things that are
 

1177
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,669
all of the things that are
are searchable or rather are reachable

1178
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
are searchable or rather are reachable
 

1179
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,789
are searchable or rather are reachable
from a given source

1180
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
from a given source
 

1181
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,870
from a given source
just basically by calling visit on that

1182
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
just basically by calling visit on that
 

1183
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,630
just basically by calling visit on that
source and then expanding outward

1184
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
source and then expanding outward
 

1185
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,510
source and then expanding outward
recursively okay so i think this is

1186
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
recursively okay so i think this is
 

1187
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,310
recursively okay so i think this is
certainly

1188
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
certainly
 

1189
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,149
certainly
straightforward from an intuitive uh

1190
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
straightforward from an intuitive uh
 

1191
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,830
straightforward from an intuitive uh
perspective it's easy to get lost when

1192
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
perspective it's easy to get lost when
 

1193
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,909
perspective it's easy to get lost when
you write these kind of formal

1194
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
you write these kind of formal
 

1195
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,350
you write these kind of formal
uh induction proofs because they always

1196
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
uh induction proofs because they always
 

1197
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,870
uh induction proofs because they always
feel a tiny bit like tautology so you

1198
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
feel a tiny bit like tautology so you
 

1199
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,669
feel a tiny bit like tautology so you
should go home and

1200
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
should go home and
 

1201
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,870
should go home and
kind of convince yourself that it's that

1202
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
kind of convince yourself that it's that
 

1203
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,430
kind of convince yourself that it's that
it's not okay so of course what do we do

1204
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,440
it's not okay so of course what do we do
 

1205
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,110
it's not okay so of course what do we do
in this class we always follow the same

1206
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
in this class we always follow the same
 

1207
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,230
in this class we always follow the same
kind of boring pattern

1208
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
kind of boring pattern
 

1209
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,990
kind of boring pattern
the first thing we do define an

1210
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
the first thing we do define an
 

1211
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,510
the first thing we do define an
algorithm second thing we do

1212
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
algorithm second thing we do
 

1213
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,029
algorithm second thing we do
make sure it's the right algorithm

1214
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
make sure it's the right algorithm
 

1215
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,070
make sure it's the right algorithm
what's the third thing we need to do

1216
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
what's the third thing we need to do
 

1217
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,830
what's the third thing we need to do
analyze it that's right in particular

1218
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
analyze it that's right in particular
 

1219
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,669
analyze it that's right in particular
make sure that it like finishes before

1220
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
make sure that it like finishes before
 

1221
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,190
make sure that it like finishes before
the heat death of the universe

1222
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
the heat death of the universe
 

1223
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,909
the heat death of the universe
uh and indeed uh death first search uh

1224
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
uh and indeed uh death first search uh
 

1225
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,430
uh and indeed uh death first search uh
doesn't really take all that long which

1226
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
doesn't really take all that long which
 

1227
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,470
doesn't really take all that long which
is a good thing

1228
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
is a good thing
 

1229
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,870
is a good thing
um so let's think about this a bit so

1230
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
um so let's think about this a bit so
 

1231
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,149
um so let's think about this a bit so
what's going to end up happening in

1232
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
what's going to end up happening in
 

1233
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,390
what's going to end up happening in
depth first search

1234
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
depth first search
 

1235
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,710
depth first search
well we're going to visit every vertex

1236
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
well we're going to visit every vertex
 

1237
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,789
well we're going to visit every vertex
at most once right kind of by definition

1238
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
at most once right kind of by definition
 

1239
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,070
at most once right kind of by definition
here

1240
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
here
 

1241
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,669
here
and in each case we're going to just

1242
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
and in each case we're going to just
 

1243
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,909
and in each case we're going to just
visit its neighboring edges

1244
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
visit its neighboring edges
 

1245
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,510
visit its neighboring edges
can we ever traverse an edge more than

1246
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
can we ever traverse an edge more than
 

1247
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,830
can we ever traverse an edge more than
one time

1248
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:01,840
one time
 

1249
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,430
one time
right because the visit function only

1250
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
right because the visit function only
 

1251
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,750
right because the visit function only
ever gets called uh one time per vertex

1252
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
ever gets called uh one time per vertex
 

1253
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,590
ever gets called uh one time per vertex
and our edges are directed

1254
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
and our edges are directed
 

1255
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,950
and our edges are directed
right so kind of you think about the

1256
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
right so kind of you think about the
 

1257
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,149
right so kind of you think about the
from of every edge uh the from vertex is

1258
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
from of every edge uh the from vertex is
 

1259
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,669
from of every edge uh the from vertex is
only ever visited one time

1260
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
only ever visited one time
 

1261
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,510
only ever visited one time
and hence every edge is only visited one

1262
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
and hence every edge is only visited one
 

1263
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,110
and hence every edge is only visited one
time

1264
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
time
 

1265
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,190
time
do we ever visit ah yes does dfs work

1266
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,200
do we ever visit ah yes does dfs work
 

1267
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,110
do we ever visit ah yes does dfs work
an undirected graph uh absolutely so

1268
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
an undirected graph uh absolutely so
 

1269
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,549
an undirected graph uh absolutely so
there's sort of uh different ways to

1270
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
there's sort of uh different ways to
 

1271
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,430
there's sort of uh different ways to
think about it

1272
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
think about it
 

1273
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,029
think about it
uh one is to think of an undirected

1274
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
uh one is to think of an undirected
 

1275
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,789
uh one is to think of an undirected
graph like a directed graph with two

1276
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
graph like a directed graph with two
 

1277
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,310
graph like a directed graph with two
edges pointed either way which i think

1278
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
edges pointed either way which i think
 

1279
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,830
edges pointed either way which i think
is in this class how we actually

1280
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
is in this class how we actually
 

1281
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,029
is in this class how we actually
kind of notated it in the previous

1282
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039
kind of notated it in the previous
 

1283
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,149
kind of notated it in the previous
lecture um

1284
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
lecture um
 

1285
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,430
lecture um
yeah actually that's that's probably a

1286
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
yeah actually that's that's probably a
 

1287
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,870
yeah actually that's that's probably a
reasonable way to reduce it so we'll

1288
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
reasonable way to reduce it so we'll
 

1289
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,310
reasonable way to reduce it so we'll
stick with that

1290
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
stick with that
 

1291
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,669
stick with that
uh right now does dfs ever visit a

1292
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
uh right now does dfs ever visit a
 

1293
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,590
uh right now does dfs ever visit a
vertex that is not reachable from the

1294
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
vertex that is not reachable from the
 

1295
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,549
vertex that is not reachable from the
source

1296
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559

 

1297
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,310

well the answer is no right because all

1298
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
well the answer is no right because all
 

1299
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,070
well the answer is no right because all
i ever do is recursively call on my

1300
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
i ever do is recursively call on my
 

1301
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,470
i ever do is recursively call on my
neighbors and so kind of by definition

1302
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
neighbors and so kind of by definition
 

1303
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,310
neighbors and so kind of by definition
if i'm not reachable dfs will never see

1304
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
if i'm not reachable dfs will never see
 

1305
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,710
if i'm not reachable dfs will never see
it so if i think about my run time

1306
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
it so if i think about my run time
 

1307
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,830
it so if i think about my run time
carefully it's not

1308
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
carefully it's not
 

1309
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,830
carefully it's not
quite the same as breath first search

1310
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
quite the same as breath first search
 

1311
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,750
quite the same as breath first search
remember that breath for search took v

1312
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
remember that breath for search took v
 

1313
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,590
remember that breath for search took v
plus e time in depth first search

1314
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
plus e time in depth first search
 

1315
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,430
plus e time in depth first search
it just takes order e time because i'm

1316
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
it just takes order e time because i'm
 

1317
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,909
it just takes order e time because i'm
expanding outward from the source vertex

1318
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
expanding outward from the source vertex
 

1319
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,909
expanding outward from the source vertex
hitting every edge adjacent to every

1320
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
hitting every edge adjacent to every
 

1321
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,310
hitting every edge adjacent to every
uh every vertex that i've seen so far uh

1322
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
uh every vertex that i've seen so far uh
 

1323
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,110
uh every vertex that i've seen so far uh
but i never

1324
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
but i never
 

1325
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,110
but i never
reach a vertex that i have in the that

1326
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,120
reach a vertex that i have in the that
 

1327
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,230
reach a vertex that i have in the that
isn't reachable

1328
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
isn't reachable
 

1329
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,549
isn't reachable
right and so because this only ever

1330
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
right and so because this only ever
 

1331
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,830
right and so because this only ever
touches every edge one time

1332
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
touches every edge one time
 

1333
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,390
touches every edge one time
uh we're in good shape uh and i see a

1334
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
uh we're in good shape uh and i see a
 

1335
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,950
uh we're in good shape uh and i see a
question here

1336
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
question here
 

1337
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,590
question here
yeah does vfs reach vertices that are

1338
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
yeah does vfs reach vertices that are
 

1339
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,789
yeah does vfs reach vertices that are
not reachable

1340
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
not reachable
 

1341
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,669
not reachable
uh does bffs reach vertices that are not

1342
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
uh does bffs reach vertices that are not
 

1343
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,390
uh does bffs reach vertices that are not
reachable

1344
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400

 

1345
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,390

i guess not now that you mention it but

1346
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
i guess not now that you mention it but
 

1347
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,230
i guess not now that you mention it but
at least in my boring proof of

1348
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
at least in my boring proof of
 

1349
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,390
at least in my boring proof of
of order v time last time our very first

1350
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
of order v time last time our very first
 

1351
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,750
of order v time last time our very first
step of bfs

1352
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
step of bfs
 

1353
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,710
step of bfs
reserved space proportional to v um

1354
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
reserved space proportional to v um
 

1355
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,630
reserved space proportional to v um
which is enough to already uh make that

1356
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
which is enough to already uh make that
 

1357
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,750
which is enough to already uh make that
that run time correct

1358
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
that run time correct
 

1359
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,110
that run time correct
good question yeah so i guess the way

1360
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
good question yeah so i guess the way
 

1361
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,230
good question yeah so i guess the way
that we've talked about it where you

1362
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
that we've talked about it where you
 

1363
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,990
that we've talked about it where you
construct one level set after a time

1364
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
construct one level set after a time
 

1365
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,669
construct one level set after a time
um if you think of that as reachability

1366
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
um if you think of that as reachability
 

1367
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,510
um if you think of that as reachability
then then no it doesn't reach it in the

1368
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
then then no it doesn't reach it in the
 

1369
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,230
then then no it doesn't reach it in the
for loop

1370
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
for loop
 

1371
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,070
for loop
but just by construction when we started

1372
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
but just by construction when we started
 

1373
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,430
but just by construction when we started
uh we already

1374
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
uh we already
 

1375
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,789
uh we already
took the time that we're talking about

1376
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
took the time that we're talking about
 

1377
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,430
took the time that we're talking about
here so notice these runtimes aren't

1378
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,440
here so notice these runtimes aren't
 

1379
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,110
here so notice these runtimes aren't
exactly the same so for example if my

1380
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
exactly the same so for example if my
 

1381
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,990
exactly the same so for example if my
graph has no

1382
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
graph has no
 

1383
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,549
graph has no
edges bfs still is going to take time

1384
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
edges bfs still is going to take time
 

1385
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,510
edges bfs still is going to take time
yeah because it still has to uh take

1386
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
yeah because it still has to uh take
 

1387
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:15,990
yeah because it still has to uh take
order v

1388
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
order v
 

1389
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,590
order v
time at least the way in the sort of

1390
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
time at least the way in the sort of
 

1391
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,190
time at least the way in the sort of
brain dead way that we we've implemented

1392
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
brain dead way that we we've implemented
 

1393
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,549
brain dead way that we we've implemented
it last time obviously in that case we

1394
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
it last time obviously in that case we
 

1395
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,870
it last time obviously in that case we
could probably do something better

1396
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
could probably do something better
 

1397
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,870
could probably do something better
whereas the way that we we've defined

1398
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
whereas the way that we we've defined
 

1399
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,350
whereas the way that we we've defined
the dfs algorithm it only takes edge

1400
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
the dfs algorithm it only takes edge
 

1401
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,909
the dfs algorithm it only takes edge
time i see confusion on my instructor's

1402
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
time i see confusion on my instructor's
 

1403
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,470
time i see confusion on my instructor's
face

1404
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480

1405
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,590

no okay good uh

1406
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
no okay good uh
 

1407
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,950
no okay good uh
the one thing to notice is that these

1408
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
the one thing to notice is that these
 

1409
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,789
the one thing to notice is that these
are algorithms for slightly different

1410
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
are algorithms for slightly different
 

1411
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,470
are algorithms for slightly different
tasks in some sense right the way that

1412
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
tasks in some sense right the way that
 

1413
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,230
tasks in some sense right the way that
we wrote down breadth first search last

1414
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,240
we wrote down breadth first search last
 

1415
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,510
we wrote down breadth first search last
time conveniently it gives us the

1416
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
time conveniently it gives us the
 

1417
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,549
time conveniently it gives us the
shortest path

1418
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
shortest path
 

1419
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,310
shortest path
um there are breath first algorithms

1420
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
um there are breath first algorithms
 

1421
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,990
um there are breath first algorithms
that doesn't i think we're in this class

1422
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
that doesn't i think we're in this class
 

1423
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,070
that doesn't i think we're in this class
we kind of think of breath first search

1424
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
we kind of think of breath first search
 

1425
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,830
we kind of think of breath first search
uh we motivate it in terms of the

1426
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
uh we motivate it in terms of the
 

1427
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,350
uh we motivate it in terms of the
shortest path problem but it's it's just

1428
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
shortest path problem but it's it's just
 

1429
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,310
shortest path problem but it's it's just
kind of a strategy

1430
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
kind of a strategy
 

1431
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,110
kind of a strategy
of working outwards from from a vertex

1432
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
of working outwards from from a vertex
 

1433
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,750
of working outwards from from a vertex
um

1434
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760
um
 

1435
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,350
um
whereas here uh the way we've written

1436
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
whereas here uh the way we've written
 

1437
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,549
whereas here uh the way we've written
down death first search there's no

1438
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
down death first search there's no
 

1439
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,590
down death first search there's no
reason why

1440
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
reason why
 

1441
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,789
reason why
the path that we get should be the

1442
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
the path that we get should be the
 

1443
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,549
the path that we get should be the
shortest right so to think of a really

1444
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,559
shortest right so to think of a really
 

1445
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,230
shortest right so to think of a really
extreme

1446
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
extreme
 

1447
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,789
extreme
example let's say that i have a cycle

1448
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
example let's say that i have a cycle
 

1449
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,789
example let's say that i have a cycle
graph

1450
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799

 

1451
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,990

right so i get a big loop like this

1452
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
right so i get a big loop like this
 

1453
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,549
right so i get a big loop like this
let's say that i do depth first search

1454
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
let's say that i do depth first search
 

1455
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,230
let's say that i do depth first search
starting from this vertex

1456
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
starting from this vertex
 

1457
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,750
starting from this vertex
well what will this what will happen

1458
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
well what will this what will happen
 

1459
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,590
well what will this what will happen
well this guy will call

1460
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
well this guy will call
 

1461
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,830
well this guy will call
its neighbor uh recursively who will

1462
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
its neighbor uh recursively who will
 

1463
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,750
its neighbor uh recursively who will
then call its neighbor recursively

1464
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
then call its neighbor recursively
 

1465
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,830
then call its neighbor recursively
we'll then call his name recursively and

1466
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
we'll then call his name recursively and
 

1467
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,870
we'll then call his name recursively and
so on

1468
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:28,880
so on
 

1469
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,350
so on
so of course when i do a death first

1470
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
so of course when i do a death first
 

1471
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,070
so of course when i do a death first
search

1472
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
search
 

1473
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,510
search
when i get to this vertex there's a

1474
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
when i get to this vertex there's a
 

1475
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,669
when i get to this vertex there's a
chain of one two three four vertices

1476
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:35,679
chain of one two three four vertices
 

1477
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,350
chain of one two three four vertices
behind it

1478
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
behind it
 

1479
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,710
behind it
is that the shortest path from the

1480
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
is that the shortest path from the
 

1481
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,350
is that the shortest path from the
source to uh the target here

1482
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
source to uh the target here
 

1483
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,789
source to uh the target here
well clearly not right i could have

1484
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
well clearly not right i could have
 

1485
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,470
well clearly not right i could have
could have traversed that edge i just

1486
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
could have traversed that edge i just
 

1487
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,830
could have traversed that edge i just
chose not to okay

1488
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
chose not to okay
 

1489
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,110
chose not to okay
so that's the death first search

1490
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
so that's the death first search
 

1491
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,470
so that's the death first search
algorithm it's just a essentially a

1492
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
algorithm it's just a essentially a
 

1493
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,149
algorithm it's just a essentially a
recursive strategy where

1494
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
recursive strategy where
 

1495
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,190
recursive strategy where
i traverse all my neighbors uh and and

1496
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
i traverse all my neighbors uh and and
 

1497
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,070
i traverse all my neighbors uh and and
each of my neighbors

1498
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,080
each of my neighbors
 

1499
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,950
each of my neighbors
versus their neighbors and and so on

1500
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
versus their neighbors and and so on
 

1501
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,470
versus their neighbors and and so on
okay so why might we want to use this

1502
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
okay so why might we want to use this
 

1503
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,149
okay so why might we want to use this
algorithm well we've already solved the

1504
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
algorithm well we've already solved the
 

1505
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:02,710
algorithm well we've already solved the
uh

1506
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
uh
 

1507
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,310
uh
the reachability problem so let's uh

1508
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
the reachability problem so let's uh
 

1509
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,310
the reachability problem so let's uh
solve a few more things using the same

1510
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
solve a few more things using the same
 

1511
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,710
solve a few more things using the same
uh basic strategy here

1512
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
uh basic strategy here
 

1513
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,830
uh basic strategy here
so there's some notions that we've sort

1514
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
so there's some notions that we've sort
 

1515
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,470
so there's some notions that we've sort
of

1516
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
of
 

1517
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,830
of
actually in some sense already used in

1518
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:13,840
actually in some sense already used in
 

1519
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,870
actually in some sense already used in
the lecture here but we might as well

1520
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
the lecture here but we might as well
 

1521
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,390
the lecture here but we might as well
call them out for what they are

1522
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
call them out for what they are
 

1523
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,510
call them out for what they are
which is this idea of connectivity so

1524
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
which is this idea of connectivity so
 

1525
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,230
which is this idea of connectivity so
a graph is connected if there's a path

1526
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
a graph is connected if there's a path
 

1527
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,830
a graph is connected if there's a path
getting from every vertex to every other

1528
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
getting from every vertex to every other
 

1529
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,430
getting from every vertex to every other
vertex

1530
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440

1531
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,669

right now connectivity in a directed

1532
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
right now connectivity in a directed
 

1533
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,750
right now connectivity in a directed
graph is kind of a weird

1534
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
graph is kind of a weird
 

1535
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,269
graph is kind of a weird
object right like it could be like for

1536
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
object right like it could be like for
 

1537
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,710
object right like it could be like for
instance think of a directed graph with

1538
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:32,720
instance think of a directed graph with
 

1539
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,750
instance think of a directed graph with
just two edges

1540
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
just two edges
 

1541
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,710
just two edges
and one edge goes from u to v right then

1542
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
and one edge goes from u to v right then
 

1543
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,830
and one edge goes from u to v right then
i can get from v

1544
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
i can get from v
 

1545
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,230
i can get from v
to u but not vice versa that's kind of a

1546
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
to u but not vice versa that's kind of a
 

1547
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,029
to u but not vice versa that's kind of a
weird uh

1548
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
weird uh
 

1549
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,630
weird uh
notion so here uh in in 606 we'll mostly

1550
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
notion so here uh in in 606 we'll mostly
 

1551
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,510
notion so here uh in in 606 we'll mostly
worry about

1552
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:45,520
worry about
 

1553
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,590
worry about
connectivity only for undirected graphs

1554
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
connectivity only for undirected graphs
 

1555
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,110
connectivity only for undirected graphs
because they're the vertices just

1556
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120
because they're the vertices just
 

1557
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,950
because they're the vertices just
basically come in like big connected uh

1558
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
basically come in like big connected uh
 

1559
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,830
basically come in like big connected uh
clumps

1560
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
clumps
 

1561
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,750
clumps
uh or the more technical term for a big

1562
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
uh or the more technical term for a big
 

1563
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,310
uh or the more technical term for a big
connected clump is a connected component

1564
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
connected clump is a connected component
 

1565
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,870
connected clump is a connected component
yeah so let's see an example so let's

1566
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
yeah so let's see an example so let's
 

1567
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,789
yeah so let's see an example so let's
say that i have a graph

1568
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
say that i have a graph
 

1569
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,390
say that i have a graph
which has an edge

1570
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
which has an edge
 

1571
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,070
which has an edge
and then a triangle

1572
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
and then a triangle
 

1573
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,830
and then a triangle
this is one graph do you see that

1574
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
this is one graph do you see that
 

1575
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,350
this is one graph do you see that
there's a collection of vertices

1576
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,360
there's a collection of vertices
 

1577
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,549
there's a collection of vertices
and there's a collection of edges but uh

1578
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
and there's a collection of edges but uh
 

1579
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,310
and there's a collection of edges but uh
it has two connected components right

1580
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
it has two connected components right
 

1581
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,590
it has two connected components right
the guy on the right

1582
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
the guy on the right
 

1583
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,470
the guy on the right
and the guy on the left meaning that

1584
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480
and the guy on the left meaning that

goes from the triangle to the line

1594
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
goes from the triangle to the line
 

1595

yep and so in the connected components

1598
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
yep and so in the connected components
 

1599
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:32,549
yep and so in the connected components
problem

1600
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
problem
 

1601
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,590
problem
we're given a graph like this guy and

1602
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
we're given a graph like this guy and
 

1603
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,190
we're given a graph like this guy and
initially we don't you know

1604
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
initially we don't you know
 

1605
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,390
initially we don't you know
okay when i draw it like this it's

1606
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
okay when i draw it like this it's
 

1607
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,310
okay when i draw it like this it's
pretty clear that uh

1608
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
pretty clear that uh
 

1609
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,750
pretty clear that uh
you know my graph has two connected

1610
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
you know my graph has two connected
 

1611
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,149
you know my graph has two connected
components maybe my graph embedding

1612
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
components maybe my graph embedding
 

1613
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,750
components maybe my graph embedding
algorithm failed and it drew an edge

1614
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
algorithm failed and it drew an edge
 

1615
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,870
algorithm failed and it drew an edge
like that

1616
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
like that
 

1617
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,710
like that
well then maybe i don't know it's still

1618
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
well then maybe i don't know it's still
 

1619
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,750
well then maybe i don't know it's still
pretty obvious that there's two

1620
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:49,760
pretty obvious that there's two
 

1621
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,350
pretty obvious that there's two
connected components but

1622
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
connected components but
 

1623
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,029
connected components but
you can imagine a universe where you

1624
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,039
you can imagine a universe where you
 

1625
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,710
you can imagine a universe where you
don't know that a priori and

1626
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
don't know that a priori and
 

1627
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,070
don't know that a priori and
and the problem you're trying to solve

1628
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
and the problem you're trying to solve
 

1629
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,909
and the problem you're trying to solve
is just to enumerate all these clumps of

1630
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
is just to enumerate all these clumps of
 

1631
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,190
is just to enumerate all these clumps of
vertices that are reachable from one

1632
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
vertices that are reachable from one
 

1633

um we can use depth first search to

1640
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
um we can use depth first search to
 

1641
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,750
um we can use depth first search to
solve this problem pretty easily

1642
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
solve this problem pretty easily
 

1643
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,029
solve this problem pretty easily
right so how could we do it well in some

1644
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
right so how could we do it well in some
 

1645
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,549
right so how could we do it well in some
sense

1646
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
sense
 

1647
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,470
sense
how can we find one connected component

1648
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,480
how can we find one connected component
 

1649
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,149
how can we find one connected component
so let's say that i just choose a vertex

1650
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
so let's say that i just choose a vertex
 

1651
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,950
so let's say that i just choose a vertex
in my graph

1652
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960

 

1653
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,310

well what do i know about everything in

1654
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
well what do i know about everything in
 

1655
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,190
well what do i know about everything in
this connected component

1656
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
this connected component
 

1657
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,350
this connected component
well it's reachable from that vertex

1658
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,360
well it's reachable from that vertex
 

1659
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,870
well it's reachable from that vertex
remember we just solved the reachability

1660
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
remember we just solved the reachability
 

1661
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,830
remember we just solved the reachability
problem which says

1662
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
problem which says
 

1663
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,470
problem which says
if i have a vertex i can now tell you

1664
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
if i have a vertex i can now tell you
 

1665
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,590
if i have a vertex i can now tell you
all the other vertices that are

1666
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600
all the other vertices that are
 

1667
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,029
all the other vertices that are
reachable from this guy

1668
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
reachable from this guy
 

1669
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,310
reachable from this guy
right so i could call dfs on well any

1670
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,320
right so i could call dfs on well any
 

1671
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,230
right so i could call dfs on well any
vertex of this cycle here

1672
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
vertex of this cycle here
 

1673
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,669
vertex of this cycle here
called the reachability thing and i know

1674
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
called the reachability thing and i know
 

1675
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,789
called the reachability thing and i know
that for every vertex there's one of two

1676
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
that for every vertex there's one of two
 

1677
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,830
that for every vertex there's one of two
things right either

1678
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
things right either
 

1679
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,909
things right either
that vertex has a parent in that object

1680
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
that vertex has a parent in that object
 

1681
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,070
that vertex has a parent in that object
p or it's the source

1682
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,080
p or it's the source
 

1683
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,350
p or it's the source
right so i could very easily find the

1684
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
right so i could very easily find the
 

1685
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,190
right so i could very easily find the
connected component corresponding to

1686
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,200
connected component corresponding to
 

1687
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,750
connected component corresponding to
that vertex does that make sense

1688
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,760
that vertex does that make sense
 

1689
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,870
that vertex does that make sense
have i found all the connected

1690
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
have i found all the connected
 

1691
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,830
have i found all the connected
components no i found one right i found

1692
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
components no i found one right i found
 

1693
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,389
components no i found one right i found
the one

1694
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
the one
 

1695
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,909
the one
corresponding to the arbitrary vertex

1696
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
corresponding to the arbitrary vertex
 

1697
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,789
corresponding to the arbitrary vertex
that i just chose so how could i fix

1698
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799
that i just chose so how could i fix
 

1699
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,389
that i just chose so how could i fix
this

1700
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399
this
 

1701
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,230
this
well it's super simple i could put a for

1702
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,240
well it's super simple i could put a for
 

1703
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,590
well it's super simple i could put a for
loop on the outside

1704
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:07,600
loop on the outside
 

1705
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,269
loop on the outside
which just loops over all the vertices

1706
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:09,279
which just loops over all the vertices
 

1707
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,990
which just loops over all the vertices
maybe and if that vertex is not part of

1708
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
maybe and if that vertex is not part of
 

1709
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,590
maybe and if that vertex is not part of
a connected component yet then i need to

1710
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
a connected component yet then i need to
 

1711
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,269
a connected component yet then i need to
make a new one

1712
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
make a new one
 

1713
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,430
make a new one
so then i call dfs on that vertex i

1714
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
so then i call dfs on that vertex i
 

1715
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,269
so then i call dfs on that vertex i
collect all the vertices that i got

1716
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
collect all the vertices that i got
 

1717
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,350
collect all the vertices that i got
and i iterate so this is a the algorithm

1718
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
and i iterate so this is a the algorithm
 

1719
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,950
and i iterate so this is a the algorithm
that uh in this class we're going to

1720
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
that uh in this class we're going to
 

1721
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,430
that uh in this class we're going to
call

1722
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
call
 

1723
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,149
call
full dfs by the way you could do the

1724
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
full dfs by the way you could do the
 

1725
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,269
full dfs by the way you could do the
same thing with full breadth first

1726
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:27,279
same thing with full breadth first
 

1727
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,389
same thing with full breadth first
search that's perfectly fine um

1728
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
search that's perfectly fine um
 

1729
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,950
search that's perfectly fine um
just kind of by analogy here right so

1730
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:32,960
just kind of by analogy here right so
 

1731
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,510
just kind of by analogy here right so
what is

1732
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
what is
 

1733
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,310
what is
full d oh this chalk is easier

1734
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
full d oh this chalk is easier
 

1735
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,310
full d oh this chalk is easier
uh well i'm going to iterate over all my

1736
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
uh well i'm going to iterate over all my
 

1737
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,870
uh well i'm going to iterate over all my
vertices

1738
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:42,880
vertices
 

1739
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,990
vertices
where i stands for for loop

1740
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000

 

1741
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,510

right so if v is

1742
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
right so if v is
 

1743
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,110
right so if v is
unvisited

1744
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120

 

1745
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,789

then i'm going to do d f s starting at v

1746
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
then i'm going to do d f s starting at v
 

1747
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,029
then i'm going to do d f s starting at v
i guess we use we use visit to refer to

1748
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
i guess we use we use visit to refer to
 

1749
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,389
i guess we use we use visit to refer to
this in the previous slide

1750
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:02,399
this in the previous slide
 

1751
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,830
this in the previous slide
and that's going to kind of flood fill

1752
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
and that's going to kind of flood fill
 

1753
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,909
and that's going to kind of flood fill
that whole connected component

1754
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
that whole connected component
 

1755
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,430
that whole connected component
and then i can connect you know collect

1756
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
and then i can connect you know collect
 

1757
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,110
and then i can connect you know collect
that connected component and continue

1758
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
that connected component and continue
 

1759
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,470
that connected component and continue
be a little bit careful because of

1760
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
be a little bit careful because of
 

1761
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,630
be a little bit careful because of
course we don't want like checking

1762
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:12,640
course we don't want like checking
 

1763
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,070
course we don't want like checking
things something to be visited to

1764
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,080
things something to be visited to
 

1765
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,029
things something to be visited to
somehow take

1766
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,039
somehow take
 

1767
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,470
somehow take
a bunch of time and make my algorithm

1768
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
a bunch of time and make my algorithm
 

1769
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,310
a bunch of time and make my algorithm
slower than it needs to be but of course

1770
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
slower than it needs to be but of course
 

1771
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,029
slower than it needs to be but of course
we have a set

1772
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
we have a set
 

1773
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,630
we have a set
data structure that we know uh can do

1774
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
data structure that we know uh can do
 

1775
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,310
data structure that we know uh can do
that in in order one time

1776
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,320
that in in order one time
 

1777
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,310
that in in order one time
at least in expectation okay

1778
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
at least in expectation okay
 

1779
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,430
at least in expectation okay
so this is the full dfs algorithm

1780
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,440
so this is the full dfs algorithm
 

1781
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,350
so this is the full dfs algorithm
it's really simple well it's dfs because

1782
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
it's really simple well it's dfs because
 

1783
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,830
it's really simple well it's dfs because
i called dfs on every vertex it was full

1784
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,840
i called dfs on every vertex it was full
 

1785
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,990
i called dfs on every vertex it was full
because i looped over all the vertices

1786
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,000
because i looped over all the vertices
 

1787
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,190
because i looped over all the vertices
uh right and so if we think about it how

1788
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200
uh right and so if we think about it how
 

1789
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,590
uh right and so if we think about it how
much time does this algorithm take

1790
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,600
much time does this algorithm take
 

1791
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,870
much time does this algorithm take
it's a little bit sneaky because somehow

1792
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
it's a little bit sneaky because somehow
 

1793
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,190
it's a little bit sneaky because somehow
i have a for loop over all the vertices

1794
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,200
i have a for loop over all the vertices
 

1795
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,710
i have a for loop over all the vertices
that i could imagine a universe where i

1796
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
that i could imagine a universe where i
 

1797
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,669
that i could imagine a universe where i
get like vertices

1798
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
get like vertices
 

1799
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,990
get like vertices
times some other number because there's

1800
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
times some other number because there's
 

1801
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,269
times some other number because there's
a for loop and there's something inside

1802
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
a for loop and there's something inside
 

1803
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,389
a for loop and there's something inside
of it right i think that's how we're

1804
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
of it right i think that's how we're
 

1805
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,510
of it right i think that's how we're
used to thinking about

1806
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
used to thinking about
 

1807
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,710
used to thinking about
run time of for loops but

1808
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:58,720
run time of for loops but
 

1809
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,909
run time of for loops but
in this case that actually doesn't

1810
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
in this case that actually doesn't
 

1811
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,590
in this case that actually doesn't
happen because there's never a case

1812
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:01,600
happen because there's never a case
 

1813
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,110
happen because there's never a case
where an edge gets traversed more than

1814
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
where an edge gets traversed more than
 

1815
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,830
where an edge gets traversed more than
one time

1816
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
one time
 

1817
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,269
one time
because if i'm in one connected

1818
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
because if i'm in one connected
 

1819
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,590
because if i'm in one connected
component then by definition i can't be

1820
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,600
component then by definition i can't be
 

1821
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,510
component then by definition i can't be
in another connected component

1822
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
in another connected component
 

1823
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,909
in another connected component
right and so what happens is in some

1824
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919
right and so what happens is in some
 

1825
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,870
right and so what happens is in some
sense this

1826
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
sense this
 

1827
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,350
sense this
innocent looking call to dfs i suppose

1828
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
innocent looking call to dfs i suppose
 

1829
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,870
innocent looking call to dfs i suppose
if you were like a lisp

1830
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:16,880
if you were like a lisp
 

1831
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,990
if you were like a lisp
programmer you somehow wouldn't like

1832
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
programmer you somehow wouldn't like
 

1833
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,990
programmer you somehow wouldn't like
this it has a side effect right

1834
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
this it has a side effect right
 

1835
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,750
this it has a side effect right
which is that i marked all the vertices

1836
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:21,760
which is that i marked all the vertices
 

1837
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,029
which is that i marked all the vertices
in that connected component as don't

1838
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
in that connected component as don't
 

1839
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,470
in that connected component as don't
touch me again

1840
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480
touch me again
 

1841
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,470
touch me again
right and so implicitly i kind of

1842
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
right and so implicitly i kind of
 

1843
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,029
right and so implicitly i kind of
removed edges uh in this process

1844
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,039
removed edges uh in this process
 

1845
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,950
removed edges uh in this process
so if you think through it carefully the

1846
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
so if you think through it carefully the
 

1847
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,149
so if you think through it carefully the
runtime of this

1848
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:32,159
runtime of this
 

1849
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,430
runtime of this
full dfs algorithm is v plus e

1850
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:35,440
full dfs algorithm is v plus e
 

1851
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,310
full dfs algorithm is v plus e
time because every edge is touched no

1852
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320

more than one time

1854
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:40,159
more than one time
 

1855
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,669
more than one time
kind of amortized over all the the

1856
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
kind of amortized over all the the

different calls to d of s here

1858
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,000
different calls to d of s here
 

1859
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,350
different calls to d of s here
uh and there's this for loop over

1860
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
uh and there's this for loop over
 

1861
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,110
uh and there's this for loop over
vertices so there's clearly an an order

1862
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,120
vertices so there's clearly an an order
 

1863
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,789
vertices so there's clearly an an order
v that you you need here

does that argument make sense so again

1866
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000
does that argument make sense so again

okay uh right so this is the the basic

1876
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
okay uh right so this is the the basic
 

1877
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,149
okay uh right so this is the the basic
problem

1878
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159

why would you want an algorithm finds

1886
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,000
why would you want an algorithm finds
 

1887
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,269
why would you want an algorithm finds
connected components like why would you

1888
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
connected components like why would you
 

1889
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,870

even have a graph that's disconnected or

1890
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
even have a graph that's disconnected or
 

1891
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,509
even have a graph that's disconnected or

um but of course that can happen a lot

1894
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
um but of course that can happen a lot
 

1895
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,190
um but of course that can happen a lot
so if like for instance maybe work at

1896
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
so if like for instance maybe work at
 

1897
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,750
so if like for instance maybe work at
a social media company and people have

1898
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
a social media company and people have
 

1899
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,549
a social media company and people have
friends but like

1900
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
friends but like

oath kind of thing

1908
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
oath kind of thing
 

1909
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,149
oath kind of thing
uh then you know that might be not so

1910
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:28,159
uh then you know that might be not so
 

1911
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,310
uh then you know that might be not so
easy to find uh in the graph because of

we're just two among a sea of students
in this classroom

1918
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
in this classroom
 

1919
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,230
in this classroom
uh uh all of which have different

1920
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
uh uh all of which have different
 

1921
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,669
uh uh all of which have different
interconnections that are just

1922
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
interconnections that are just
 

1923
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,669
interconnections that are just
enumerated uh based on the list of edges

1924
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
enumerated uh based on the list of edges
 

1925
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,070
enumerated uh based on the list of edges
right

1926
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
right
 

1927
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,789
right
and and so even though like pictorially

1928
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:42,799
and and so even though like pictorially
 

1929
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,950
and and so even though like pictorially
it's kind of hard to draw

1930
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:44,960
it's kind of hard to draw
 

1931
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,110
it's kind of hard to draw
uh connected component algorithm in a

1932
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
uh connected component algorithm in a
 

1933
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,029
uh connected component algorithm in a
way that doesn't make it sound kind of

1934
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:49,039
way that doesn't make it sound kind of
 

1935
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,630
way that doesn't make it sound kind of
like a useless technique from the start

1936
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:50,640
like a useless technique from the start
 

1937
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,149
like a useless technique from the start
because like it's very clear there are

1938
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:52,159
because like it's very clear there are
 

1939
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,590
because like it's very clear there are
two connected components there

1940
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
two connected components there
 

1941
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,190
two connected components there
uh of course we still have to be able to

1942
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
uh of course we still have to be able to
 

1943
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,789
uh of course we still have to be able to
write code to solve this uh this sort of

1944
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:56,799
write code to solve this uh this sort of
 

1945
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,710
write code to solve this uh this sort of
thing

1946
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
thing
 

1947
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,110
thing
okay so for once i think i'm almost on

1948
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,120
okay so for once i think i'm almost on
 

1949
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,750
okay so for once i think i'm almost on

1950
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
time
 

1951
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,470
time
uh in lecture today so we have one

1952
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480
uh in lecture today so we have one
 

1953
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,070
uh in lecture today so we have one
additional uh

application of of death first search uh

1956
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:08,799
application of of death first search uh
 

1957
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,310
application of of death first search uh
in our class today

1958
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,320
in our class today
 

1959
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,269
in our class today
uh which is sort of on the opposite end

1960
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:13,279
uh which is sort of on the opposite end
 

1961
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:13,509
uh which is sort of on the opposite end
of

1962
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
of
 

1963
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,310
of
the spectrum so we just talked about uh

1964
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,320
the spectrum so we just talked about uh
 

1965
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,470
the spectrum so we just talked about uh
graphs that are undirected and thinking

1966
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
graphs that are undirected and thinking
 

1967
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,149
graphs that are undirected and thinking
about cycles uh

1968
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:20,159
about cycles uh
 

1969
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,990
about cycles uh
now on the opposite end we might think

1970
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000
now on the opposite end we might think
 

1971
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,830
now on the opposite end we might think
of a dag

1972
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840
of a dag
 

1973
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,470
of a dag
so a dag is a directed acyclic graph

1974
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
so a dag is a directed acyclic graph
 

1975
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,149
so a dag is a directed acyclic graph
can anybody think of a special case of a

1976
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:30,159
can anybody think of a special case of a
 

1977
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,750
can anybody think of a special case of a
dag i suppose i should define it first

1978
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,760
dag i suppose i should define it first
 

1979
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,549
dag i suppose i should define it first
and then we'll come back to that

1980
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559
and then we'll come back to that
 

1981
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,350
and then we'll come back to that
question uh which means uh exactly what

1982
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,360
question uh which means uh exactly what
 

1983
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,350
question uh which means uh exactly what
it sounds like so it's a graph that has

1984
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
it sounds like so it's a graph that has
 

1985
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,950
it sounds like so it's a graph that has
directed edges now

1986
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
directed edges now
 

1987
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,630
directed edges now
and doesn't have any cycles in it so

1988
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
and doesn't have any cycles in it so
 

1989
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,990
and doesn't have any cycles in it so
actually the graph i

1990
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,000
actually the graph i
 

1991
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,350
actually the graph i
gave you all the meaning of lecture

1992
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,360
gave you all the meaning of lecture
 

1993
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,269
gave you all the meaning of lecture
um i think secretly was an example of

1994
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
um i think secretly was an example of
 

1995
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,630
um i think secretly was an example of
one of these

1996
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:48,640
one of these
 

1997
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,909
one of these
so let's say that i have directed edges

1998
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
so let's say that i have directed edges
 

1999
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,830
so let's say that i have directed edges
maybe if i make the header triangle

2000
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
maybe if i make the header triangle
 

2001
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,590
maybe if i make the header triangle
that's a little easier to see

2002
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
that's a little easier to see
 

2003
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,310
that's a little easier to see
i'm not so sure uh in any event so i'm

2004
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
i'm not so sure uh in any event so i'm
 

2005
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,870
i'm not so sure uh in any event so i'm
going to have an

2006
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
going to have an
 

2007
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,470
going to have an
edge up and an edge to the right and

2008
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:02,480
edge up and an edge to the right and
 

2009
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,990
edge up and an edge to the right and
similarly an edge down an edge to the

2010
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,000
similarly an edge down an edge to the
 

2011
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,750
similarly an edge down an edge to the
right

2012
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760

 

2013
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,230

this graph looks like a cycle but it's

2014
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,240
this graph looks like a cycle but it's
 

2015
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,310
this graph looks like a cycle but it's
not because the only direction

2016
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
not because the only direction
 

2017
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,149
not because the only direction
that i can move is from the left-hand

2018
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
that i can move is from the left-hand
 

2019
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,830
that i can move is from the left-hand
side to the right-hand side

2020
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:15,840
side to the right-hand side
 

2021
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,750
side to the right-hand side
so this is a directed graph and it

2022
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:17,760
so this is a directed graph and it
 

2023
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,110
so this is a directed graph and it
doesn't contain any cycles meaning

2024
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
doesn't contain any cycles meaning
 

2025
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,070
doesn't contain any cycles meaning
there's no path

2026
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
there's no path
 

2027
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,230
there's no path
that i can take from a vertex that gets

2028
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
that i can take from a vertex that gets
 

2029
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,350
that i can take from a vertex that gets
back to itself

2030
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
back to itself
 

2031
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,230
back to itself
along the directed edges okay and dags

2032
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,240
along the directed edges okay and dags
 

2033
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,190
along the directed edges okay and dags
show up all the time

2034
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,200
show up all the time
 

2035
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,950
show up all the time
now that i've defined what a dag is can

2036
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
now that i've defined what a dag is can
 

2037
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,549
now that i've defined what a dag is can
somebody give me an example of a dag

2038
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
somebody give me an example of a dag
 

2039
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,549
somebody give me an example of a dag
that we've already seen in 6006

2040
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:36,559

 

2041
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,310

a tree at least if we orient all the

2042
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,320
a tree at least if we orient all the
 

2043
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,669
a tree at least if we orient all the
edges kind of pointing downward in the

2044
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
edges kind of pointing downward in the
 

2045
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,549
edges kind of pointing downward in the
tree

2046
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
tree
 

2047
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,710
tree
yep otherwise i guess kind of debatable

2048
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
yep otherwise i guess kind of debatable
 

2049
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,310
yep otherwise i guess kind of debatable
whether it's a dagger you know if

2050
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
whether it's a dagger you know if
 

2051
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,830
whether it's a dagger you know if
there's if there's no direction to the

2052
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
there's if there's no direction to the
 

2053
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,789
there's if there's no direction to the
edges then somehow

2054
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
edges then somehow
 

2055
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,909
edges then somehow
the definition just doesn't apply um

2056
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:51,919
the definition just doesn't apply um
 

2057
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,070
the definition just doesn't apply um
okay so

2058
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,080
okay so
 

2059
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,470
okay so
in uh in processing directed acyclic

2060
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
in uh in processing directed acyclic
 

2061
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,830
in uh in processing directed acyclic
graphs uh there's a really useful thing

2062
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
graphs uh there's a really useful thing
 

2063
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,350
graphs uh there's a really useful thing
that you can do that's going to show up

2064
00:33:59,350 --> 00:33:59,360
that you can do that's going to show up
 

2065
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,430
that you can do that's going to show up
in this class apparently quite a bit

2066
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
in this class apparently quite a bit
 

2067
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,630
in this class apparently quite a bit
which is kind of interesting to me i'm

2068
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
which is kind of interesting to me i'm
 

2069
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,750
which is kind of interesting to me i'm
curious to see

2070
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
curious to see
 

2071
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,389
curious to see
what that looks like which is to compute

2072
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
what that looks like which is to compute
 

2073
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,069
what that looks like which is to compute
a topological

2074
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:08,079
a topological
 

2075
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,389
a topological
order on the graph where topology is

2076
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
order on the graph where topology is
 

2077
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,190
order on the graph where topology is
here so as

2078
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
here so as
 

2079
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,270
here so as
a geometry professor in my day job i get

2080
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,280
a geometry professor in my day job i get
 

2081
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,230
a geometry professor in my day job i get
all excited uh

2082
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,240
all excited uh
 

2083
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,389
all excited uh
but in this case a topological order is

2084
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:16,399
but in this case a topological order is
 

2085
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,550
but in this case a topological order is
a fairly straightforward thing

2086
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:18,560
a fairly straightforward thing
 

2087
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,829
a fairly straightforward thing
actually it's defined on the screen and

2088
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:19,839
actually it's defined on the screen and
 

2089
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,190
actually it's defined on the screen and
i have bad handwriting anyway so let's

2090
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
i have bad handwriting anyway so let's
 

2091
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,310
i have bad handwriting anyway so let's
just stick with that

2092
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
just stick with that
 

2093
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,069
just stick with that
so topological ordering so if we think

2094
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
so topological ordering so if we think
 

2095
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,069
so topological ordering so if we think
of like f as a function that

2096
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
of like f as a function that
 

2097
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,389
of like f as a function that
assigns maybe every node an index in

2098
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
assigns maybe every node an index in
 

2099
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,430
assigns maybe every node an index in
array i should

2100
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440
array i should
 

2101
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,629
array i should
i guess i shouldn't use the word right

2102
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:30,639
i guess i shouldn't use the word right
 

2103
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,230
i guess i shouldn't use the word right
here but it's just like an index in

2104
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,240
here but it's just like an index in
 

2105
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,109
here but it's just like an index in
ordering so like

2106
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
ordering so like
 

2107
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,869
ordering so like
this is the first vertex and this is the

2108
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:34,879
this is the first vertex and this is the
 

2109
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,030
this is the first vertex and this is the
second vertex and so on

2110
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040
second vertex and so on
 

2111
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,589
second vertex and so on
then a topological order uh is one that

2112
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
then a topological order uh is one that
 

2113
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,030
then a topological order uh is one that
has the property shown here which is

2114
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
has the property shown here which is
 

2115
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,669
has the property shown here which is
that

2116
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:41,679
that
 

2117
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,349
that
if i have a directed edge from u to v

2118
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:45,359
if i have a directed edge from u to v
 

2119
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,629
if i have a directed edge from u to v
then f of u is less than f of v

2120
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
then f of u is less than f of v
 

2121
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,149
then f of u is less than f of v
so in other words if i look at the

2122
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:52,159
so in other words if i look at the
 

2123
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,909
so in other words if i look at the
ordering that i get in my topological

2124
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
ordering that i get in my topological
 

2125
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:54,710
ordering that i get in my topological
order

2126
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:54,720
order
 

2127
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,349
order
u has to appear before v yeah so let's

2128
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
u has to appear before v yeah so let's
 

2129
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,030
u has to appear before v yeah so let's
uh let's look at our example again so

2130
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
uh let's look at our example again so
 

2131
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,670
uh let's look at our example again so
let's number

2132
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
let's number
 

2133
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,950
let's number
let's give our nodes names so here's a

2134
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:02,960
let's give our nodes names so here's a
 

2135
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,349
let's give our nodes names so here's a
b c d

2136
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:07,359
b c d
 

2137
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,109
b c d
well what clearly has to be the first

2138
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:09,119
well what clearly has to be the first
 

2139
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,589
well what clearly has to be the first
node in my topological order

2140
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:11,599
node in my topological order
 

2141
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,710
node in my topological order
a right because all the way on the

2142
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
a right because all the way on the
 

2143
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,230
a right because all the way on the
left-hand side yeah

2144
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,240
left-hand side yeah
 

2145
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,069
left-hand side yeah
well after that it's a bit of a toss up

2146
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:18,079
well after that it's a bit of a toss up
 

2147
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,510
well after that it's a bit of a toss up
what do we know we know that b and c

2148
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
what do we know we know that b and c
 

2149
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,750
what do we know we know that b and c
have to appear before d

2150
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
have to appear before d
 

2151
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,870
have to appear before d
so maybe just to be annoying i do a c b

2152
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
so maybe just to be annoying i do a c b
 

2153
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,390
so maybe just to be annoying i do a c b
that's b and then d right so it's a

2154
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,400
that's b and then d right so it's a
 

2155
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,589
that's b and then d right so it's a
topological order

2156
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
topological order
 

2157
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,430
topological order
notice that things that are on the left

2158
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,440
notice that things that are on the left
 

2159
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,349
notice that things that are on the left
appear in my graph before things that

2160
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:33,359
appear in my graph before things that
 

2161
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,230
appear in my graph before things that
are on the right

2162
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
are on the right
 

2163
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,390
are on the right
where the word before here uh means that

2164
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,400
where the word before here uh means that
 

2165
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,910
where the word before here uh means that
there's an edge that points from one to

2166
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
there's an edge that points from one to
 

2167
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,430
there's an edge that points from one to
the other

2168
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,440
the other
 

2169
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,910
the other
okay by the way are topological

2170
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
okay by the way are topological
 

2171
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,710
okay by the way are topological
orderings

2172
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:42,720
orderings
 

2173
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,790
orderings
uh unique no so if we look at our graph

2174
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
uh unique no so if we look at our graph
 

2175
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,750
uh unique no so if we look at our graph
example here

2176
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
example here
 

2177
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,109
example here
a b c d is also a topological order

2178
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:53,119
a b c d is also a topological order
 

2179
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,030
a b c d is also a topological order
uh and what that means is it's somehow

2180
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
uh and what that means is it's somehow
 

2181
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,630
uh and what that means is it's somehow
very liberating right it means that

2182
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
very liberating right it means that
 

2183
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,990
very liberating right it means that
when we design an algorithm for finding

2184
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
when we design an algorithm for finding
 

2185
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,670
when we design an algorithm for finding
a topological order uh

2186
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
a topological order uh
 

2187
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,030
a topological order uh
there's some design decisions that we

2188
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
there's some design decisions that we
 

2189
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,710
there's some design decisions that we
can make uh and we just have to find one

2190
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:02,720
can make uh and we just have to find one
 

2191
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,230
can make uh and we just have to find one
among uh many

2192
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,240
among uh many
 

2193
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,750
among uh many
uh but in any event we're gonna define a

2194
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
uh but in any event we're gonna define a
 

2195
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,750
uh but in any event we're gonna define a
slightly different notion of order and

2196
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760
slightly different notion of order and
 

2197
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,470
slightly different notion of order and
then we're gonna show that they're

2198
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
then we're gonna show that they're
 

2199
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,310
then we're gonna show that they're
closely linked to each other

2200
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
closely linked to each other
 

2201
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,510
closely linked to each other
and that is the finishing order so in

2202
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
and that is the finishing order so in
 

2203
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,190
and that is the finishing order so in
the finishing order we're going to call

2204
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
the finishing order we're going to call
 

2205
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,510
the finishing order we're going to call
full dfs on our graph remember that

2206
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,520
full dfs on our graph remember that
 

2207
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,190
full dfs on our graph remember that
means we iterate over all our nodes and

2208
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200
means we iterate over all our nodes and
 

2209
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,470
means we iterate over all our nodes and
if we haven't seen that node yet we call

2210
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:22,480
if we haven't seen that node yet we call
 

2211
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,470
if we haven't seen that node yet we call
dfs on it

2212
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,480
dfs on it
 

2213
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,270
dfs on it
and now uh we're going to make an order

2214
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:27,280
and now uh we're going to make an order
 

2215
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,310
and now uh we're going to make an order
in which

2216
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,320
in which
 

2217
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,790
in which
as soon as the call to a node in that

2218
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
as soon as the call to a node in that
 

2219
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,630
as soon as the call to a node in that
visit function is complete

2220
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:32,640
visit function is complete
 

2221
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,150
visit function is complete
meaning i've already iterated over all

2222
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,160
meaning i've already iterated over all
 

2223
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,069
meaning i've already iterated over all
my neighbors then

2224
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
my neighbors then
 

2225
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,349
my neighbors then
i add my node to the ordering

2226
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:39,359
i add my node to the ordering
 

2227
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,550
i add my node to the ordering
that makes sense it's like a little bit

2228
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,560
that makes sense it's like a little bit
 

2229
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,750
that makes sense it's like a little bit
backward from what we're used to

2230
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
backward from what we're used to
 

2231
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,430
backward from what we're used to
thinking about so the order in which

2232
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
thinking about so the order in which
 

2233
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,870
thinking about so the order in which
full dfs

2234
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:44,880
full dfs
 

2235
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,910
full dfs
finishes visiting each vertex

2236
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
finishes visiting each vertex
 

2237
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,829
finishes visiting each vertex
yeah and now here's uh here's the claim

2238
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
yeah and now here's uh here's the claim
 

2239
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,710
yeah and now here's uh here's the claim
is that if we have a reverse finishing

2240
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
is that if we have a reverse finishing
 

2241
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,150
is that if we have a reverse finishing
order meaning that we take the finishing

2242
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
order meaning that we take the finishing
 

2243
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,910
order meaning that we take the finishing
order and then we flip it backward

2244
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920
order and then we flip it backward
 

2245
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,069
order and then we flip it backward
that's exactly uh gonna give us a

2246
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:00,079
that's exactly uh gonna give us a
 

2247
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,829
that's exactly uh gonna give us a
topological ordering of the vertices in

2248
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:01,839
topological ordering of the vertices in
 

2249
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,589
topological ordering of the vertices in
our graph

2250
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:03,599
our graph
 

2251
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,710
our graph
um right so let's uh do that really

2252
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
um right so let's uh do that really
 

2253
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,750
um right so let's uh do that really
quickly

2254
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,760
quickly
 

2255
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,069
quickly
so in other words our claim here

2256
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:12,079

 

2257
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,109

i think yeah let's see is that if i have

2258
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
i think yeah let's see is that if i have
 

2259
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,710
i think yeah let's see is that if i have
a directed graph

2260
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,720

 

2261
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,710

so g is a dag

2262
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
so g is a dag
 

2263
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,910
so g is a dag
then um

2264
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920

 

2265
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,230

uh let's see here then

2266
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240

 

2267
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,910

oops my notes are backwards so i should

2268
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
oops my notes are backwards so i should
 

2269
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,270
oops my notes are backwards so i should
switch to my

2270
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,280
switch to my
 

2271
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,829
switch to my
jason's notes which of course are

2272
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:34,839
jason's notes which of course are
 

2273
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,140
jason's notes which of course are
correct

2274
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,150
correct
 

2275
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:41,190
correct
[Laughter]

2276
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,200

 

2277
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,829

right so if if i have a graph that's a

2278
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:43,839
right so if if i have a graph that's a
 

2279
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,710
right so if if i have a graph that's a
dag then the

2280
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:44,720
dag then the
 

2281
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:54,790
dag then the
reverse of the finishing order

2282
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800

 

2283
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,829

is a topological order

2284
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:01,839

 

2285
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,349

by the way we're not going to prove the

2286
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
by the way we're not going to prove the
 

2287
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,030
by the way we're not going to prove the
converse that if i have

2288
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,040
converse that if i have
 

2289
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,589
converse that if i have
a topological order that somehow that

2290
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:07,599
a topological order that somehow that
 

2291
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,310
a topological order that somehow that
thing is the reverse of

2292
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,320
thing is the reverse of
 

2293
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,550
thing is the reverse of
uh dfs at least the way that maybe i

2294
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:12,560
uh dfs at least the way that maybe i
 

2295
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,589
uh dfs at least the way that maybe i
coded it

2296
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599
coded it
 

2297
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,710
coded it
there's a slightly different statement

2298
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:14,720
there's a slightly different statement
 

2299
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,430
there's a slightly different statement
which is does there exist a dfs

2300
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,440
which is does there exist a dfs
 

2301
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,270
which is does there exist a dfs
that has that ordering but that's one

2302
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,280
that has that ordering but that's one
 

2303
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,870
that has that ordering but that's one
that we'll worry about

2304
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
that we'll worry about
 

2305
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,190
that we'll worry about
another time around piazza or whatever

2306
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200
another time around piazza or whatever
 

2307
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,150
another time around piazza or whatever
okay so

2308
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,160
okay so
 

2309
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,430
okay so
uh let's see here

2310
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:27,440

 

2311
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,030

so we need to prove this thing so what

2312
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
so we need to prove this thing so what
 

2313
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,550
so we need to prove this thing so what
are we gonna do well what do we need to

2314
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:30,560
are we gonna do well what do we need to
 

2315
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,430
are we gonna do well what do we need to
check if

2316
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:31,440
check if
 

2317
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,349
check if
is a top large quarter is that if i look

2318
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
is a top large quarter is that if i look
 

2319
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,630
is a top large quarter is that if i look
at any edge in my graph

2320
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:34,640
at any edge in my graph
 

2321
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,390
at any edge in my graph
it obeys the relationship that i have on

2322
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,400
it obeys the relationship that i have on
 

2323
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,750
it obeys the relationship that i have on
the screen here

2324
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760
the screen here
 

2325
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,829
the screen here
uh so in particularly we're going to

2326
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:39,839
uh so in particularly we're going to
 

2327
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,829
uh so in particularly we're going to
take the u

2328
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:41,839
take the u
 

2329
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,710
take the u
v inside of my set of edges and then

2330
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
v inside of my set of edges and then
 

2331
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,630
v inside of my set of edges and then
what i need

2332
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640

 

2333
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,270

is the u is ordered

2334
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,280
is the u is ordered
 

2335
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,790
is the u is ordered
before v

2336
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:56,800

 

2337
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,790

uh using uh the reverse of the finishing

2338
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:58,800
uh using uh the reverse of the finishing
 

2339
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,790
uh using uh the reverse of the finishing
order that we've defined here

2340
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
order that we've defined here
 

2341
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,470
order that we've defined here
okay so let's think back to our

2342
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
okay so let's think back to our
 

2343
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,790
okay so let's think back to our
call to the dfs algorithm remember we

2344
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:06,800
call to the dfs algorithm remember we
 

2345
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,109
call to the dfs algorithm remember we
call this visit function

2346
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:09,119
call this visit function
 

2347
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,910
call this visit function
right so we have two cases right either

2348
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:11,920
right so we have two cases right either
 

2349
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,230
right so we have two cases right either
u

2350
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
u
 

2351
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,349
u
is visited before v or it ain't

2352
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
is visited before v or it ain't
 

2353
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,910
is visited before v or it ain't
yeah uh so let's let's do those uh those

2354
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:17,920
yeah uh so let's let's do those uh those
 

2355
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,910
yeah uh so let's let's do those uh those
two cases

2356
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920

 

2357
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,190

so case number one

2358
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,200

 

2359
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,310

is u is visited

2360
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:28,320
is u is visited
 

2361
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,190
is u is visited
before v

2362
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200

 

2363
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:40,710

okay

2364
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:40,720

 

2365
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,710

all right so what does that mean well

2366
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
all right so what does that mean well
 

2367
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,390
all right so what does that mean well
remember that there's an edge

2368
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:44,400
remember that there's an edge
 

2369
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,990
remember that there's an edge
like pictorially what's going on well

2370
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
like pictorially what's going on well
 

2371
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,349
like pictorially what's going on well
there's like all kinds of graph stuff

2372
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359
there's like all kinds of graph stuff
 

2373
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,950
there's like all kinds of graph stuff
going on and then there's u

2374
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:48,960
going on and then there's u
 

2375
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,550
going on and then there's u
and we know that there's a directed edge

2376
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,560
and we know that there's a directed edge
 

2377
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,870
and we know that there's a directed edge
from u to v

2378
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:52,880
from u to v
 

2379
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,390
from u to v
right that's our our picture right and

2380
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,400
right that's our our picture right and
 

2381
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,670
right that's our our picture right and
maybe there's other stuff going on

2382
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:55,680
maybe there's other stuff going on
 

2383
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,750
maybe there's other stuff going on
outside of v

2384
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:57,760
outside of v
 

2385
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,710
outside of v
so in particular well just by the way

2386
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
so in particular well just by the way
 

2387
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,310
so in particular well just by the way
that we've defined that visit function

2388
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,320
that we've defined that visit function
 

2389
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,270
that we've defined that visit function
what do we know

2390
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,280
what do we know
 

2391
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,030
what do we know
we know that when we call visit

2392
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,040
we know that when we call visit
 

2393
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,470
we know that when we call visit
on u well

2394
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
on u well
 

2395
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,550
on u well
v is one of its outgoing neighbors so in

2396
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
v is one of its outgoing neighbors so in
 

2397
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,150
v is one of its outgoing neighbors so in
particular a visit on you

2398
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,160
particular a visit on you
 

2399
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,309
particular a visit on you
is going to call

2400
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:18,319

 

2401
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,630

visit v and we know that because

2402
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:22,640
visit v and we know that because
 

2403
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,670
visit v and we know that because
well you visited before v right

2404
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
well you visited before v right
 

2405
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,150
well you visited before v right
so currently v's parent is none when i

2406
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,160
so currently v's parent is none when i
 

2407
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,069
so currently v's parent is none when i
get to u

2408
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
get to u
 

2409
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,349
get to u
that makes sense now here's where

2410
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
that makes sense now here's where
 

2411
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,790
that makes sense now here's where
reverse ordering

2412
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:34,800
reverse ordering
 

2413
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,910
reverse ordering
we're gonna have to keep it in our head

2414
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
we're gonna have to keep it in our head
 

2415
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,870
we're gonna have to keep it in our head
right because now well you visit a view

2416
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:38,880
right because now well you visit a view
 

2417
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,069
right because now well you visit a view
called visitor v so notice that visit of

2418
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
called visitor v so notice that visit of
 

2419
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:42,470
called visitor v so notice that visit of
v

2420
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
v
 

2421
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:50,829
v
has to complete before visited of you

2422
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:50,839

 

2423
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:51,990

right

2424
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,000
right
 

2425
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,589
right
v completes before

2426
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599

 

2427
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,750

visit of u well so in reverse

2428
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
visit of u well so in reverse
 

2429
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,950
visit of u well so in reverse
uh uh sorting

2430
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:04,960
uh uh sorting
 

2431
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,950
uh uh sorting
in reverse finishing order here what

2432
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
in reverse finishing order here what
 

2433
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,069
in reverse finishing order here what
does that mean

2434
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:08,079
does that mean
 

2435
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,470
does that mean
well if this completes before uh the

2436
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
well if this completes before uh the
 

2437
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,829
well if this completes before uh the
other guy then they get flipped backward

2438
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:11,839
other guy then they get flipped backward
 

2439
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,790
other guy then they get flipped backward
in the list

2440
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:12,800
in the list
 

2441
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,309
in the list
which is exactly what i want because

2442
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:14,319
which is exactly what i want because
 

2443
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,030
which is exactly what i want because
there's an edge from u to v

2444
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,040
there's an edge from u to v
 

2445
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,069
there's an edge from u to v
okay so case one is done now

2446
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
okay so case one is done now
 

2447
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,430
okay so case one is done now
we have case 2

2448
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440

 

2449
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:33,589

which is that v is visited before you

2450
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599

 

2451
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,190

okay so now um i'm gonna make one

2452
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,200
okay so now um i'm gonna make one
 

2453
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,870
okay so now um i'm gonna make one
additional observation

2454
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
additional observation
 

2455
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,710
additional observation
okay so uh let's now i'm gonna go back

2456
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:40,720
okay so uh let's now i'm gonna go back
 

2457
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,750
okay so uh let's now i'm gonna go back
to my other notes because i like my

2458
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
to my other notes because i like my
 

2459
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,670
to my other notes because i like my
schematic better

2460
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:45,680

 

2461
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,870

right so what's our our basic picture uh

2462
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
right so what's our our basic picture uh
 

2463
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,230
right so what's our our basic picture uh
here

2464
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
here
 

2465
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,550
here
i don't know i oh you know what it was i

2466
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,560
i don't know i oh you know what it was i
 

2467
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,069
i don't know i oh you know what it was i
printed out another copy of this

2468
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,079
printed out another copy of this
 

2469
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,230
printed out another copy of this
that's okay i can do it on my head okay

2470
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,240
that's okay i can do it on my head okay
 

2471
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,390
that's okay i can do it on my head okay
so here's my my source vertex his name

2472
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,400
so here's my my source vertex his name
 

2473
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,349
so here's my my source vertex his name
is s

2474
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,359

 

2475
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,030

now there's a bunch of edges and

2476
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,040
now there's a bunch of edges and
 

2477
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,670
now there's a bunch of edges and
whatever there's a long path

2478
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
whatever there's a long path
 

2479
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,030
whatever there's a long path
and now eventually what happens well

2480
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,040
and now eventually what happens well
 

2481
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,470
and now eventually what happens well
i have a node v

2482
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
i have a node v
 

2483
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,069
i have a node v
and somewhere out there in the universe

2484
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079
and somewhere out there in the universe
 

2485
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,550
and somewhere out there in the universe
there's another node u

2486
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:16,560
there's another node u
 

2487
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,550
there's another node u
and what do i know i know that uh

2488
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:18,560
and what do i know i know that uh
 

2489
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,990
and what do i know i know that uh
there's by assumption i know that

2490
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,000
there's by assumption i know that
 

2491
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,349
there's by assumption i know that
there's an edge from u

2492
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
there's an edge from u
 

2493
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,750
there's an edge from u
to v that makes sense so that's our sort

2494
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
to v that makes sense so that's our sort
 

2495
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,829
to v that makes sense so that's our sort
of picture so far

2496
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:25,839
of picture so far
 

2497
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,710
of picture so far
okay so what do we know we know that our

2498
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:28,720
okay so what do we know we know that our
 

2499
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,790
okay so what do we know we know that our
graph is acyclic

2500
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:30,800
graph is acyclic
 

2501
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,069
graph is acyclic
yeah right that kind of by definition

2502
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:32,079
yeah right that kind of by definition
 

2503
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,309
yeah right that kind of by definition
that's our assumption so

2504
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319
that's our assumption so
 

2505
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,390
that's our assumption so
can we reach u from v

2506
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,400
can we reach u from v
 

2507
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,390
can we reach u from v
in other words does there exist a path

2508
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
in other words does there exist a path
 

2509
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,710
in other words does there exist a path
from v to u

2510
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:42,720
from v to u
 

2511
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:49,190
from v to u
right so that would look like this

2512
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,200

 

2513
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,790

no because our graph is a cyclic and i

2514
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:50,800
no because our graph is a cyclic and i
 

2515
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,470
no because our graph is a cyclic and i
just drew a cycle right

2516
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
just drew a cycle right
 

2517
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,670
just drew a cycle right
so this is a big x there's a frowny face

2518
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
so this is a big x there's a frowny face
 

2519
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,270
so this is a big x there's a frowny face
here can't do it

2520
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,280
here can't do it
 

2521
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,550
here can't do it
he has hair unlike your instructor okay

2522
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
he has hair unlike your instructor okay
 

2523
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,510
he has hair unlike your instructor okay
so uh right so what does this mean well

2524
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:03,520
so uh right so what does this mean well
 

2525
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:03,990
so uh right so what does this mean well
okay

2526
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
okay
 

2527
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,910
okay
so by this uh picture i suppose

2528
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
so by this uh picture i suppose
 

2529
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,829
so by this uh picture i suppose
we know that uh u cannot be reached from

2530
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:10,839
we know that uh u cannot be reached from
 

2531
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:20,069
we know that uh u cannot be reached from
v

2532
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:20,079

 

2533
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,430

yeah so what does that mean well

2534
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:23,440
yeah so what does that mean well
 

2535
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,069
yeah so what does that mean well
it means that the visit to v is going to

2536
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:26,079
it means that the visit to v is going to
 

2537
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,270
it means that the visit to v is going to
complete

2538
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:27,280
complete
 

2539
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,109
complete
and never see you right because remember

2540
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
and never see you right because remember
 

2541
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,950
and never see you right because remember
though the visit to v only ever calls

2542
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:30,960
though the visit to v only ever calls
 

2543
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,030
though the visit to v only ever calls
things that are kind of descendants of v

2544
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,040
things that are kind of descendants of v
 

2545
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,870
things that are kind of descendants of v
right so in other words

2546
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:36,880

 

2547
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,910

visit a v completes

2548
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:43,920

 

2549
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,470

without seeing you

2550
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:50,480

 

2551
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,829

well that's exactly the same thing that

2552
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
well that's exactly the same thing that
 

2553
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,670
well that's exactly the same thing that
we showed in our first case right so by

2554
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:53,680
we showed in our first case right so by
 

2555
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,349
we showed in our first case right so by
the same uh reasoning

2556
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:55,359
the same uh reasoning
 

2557
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,589
the same uh reasoning
right what does that mean in our reverse

2558
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,599
right what does that mean in our reverse
 

2559
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,190
right what does that mean in our reverse
finishing order

2560
00:43:59,190 --> 00:43:59,200
finishing order
 

2561
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,109
finishing order
right the ordering from from u to v is

2562
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
right the ordering from from u to v is
 

2563
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,630
right the ordering from from u to v is
is preserved

2564
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:02,640
is preserved
 

2565
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,030
is preserved
okay so that sort of completes our proof

2566
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:05,040
okay so that sort of completes our proof
 

2567
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,750
okay so that sort of completes our proof
here the

2568
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
here the
 

2569
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,750
here the
reverse finishing order gives me a

2570
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:07,760
reverse finishing order gives me a
 

2571
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,870
reverse finishing order gives me a
topological order which is kind of nice

2572
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
topological order which is kind of nice
 

2573
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,270
topological order which is kind of nice
and so this is a nice convenient way of

2574
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
and so this is a nice convenient way of
 

2575
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,950
and so this is a nice convenient way of
taking all of the nodes in a directed

2576
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:14,960
taking all of the nodes in a directed
 

2577
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,710
taking all of the nodes in a directed
acyclic graph

2578
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:16,720
acyclic graph
 

2579
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,309
acyclic graph
and ordering them in a way that respects

2580
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:18,319
and ordering them in a way that respects
 

2581
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,829
and ordering them in a way that respects
the topology or the connectivity of that

2582
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:20,839
the topology or the connectivity of that
 

2583
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,190
the topology or the connectivity of that
graph so we're going to conclude with

2584
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,200
graph so we're going to conclude with
 

2585
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,630
graph so we're going to conclude with
one final problem

2586
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,640
one final problem
 

2587
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,550
one final problem
uh which i don't have a slide on but

2588
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:26,560
uh which i don't have a slide on but
 

2589
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,230
uh which i don't have a slide on but
that's okay and that's

2590
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,240
that's okay and that's
 

2591
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,950
that's okay and that's
cycle detection so there's a bit of a an

2592
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:30,960
cycle detection so there's a bit of a an
 

2593
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,829
cycle detection so there's a bit of a an
exercise

2594
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:31,839
exercise
 

2595
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,630
exercise
left to the reader here so the problem

2596
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,640
left to the reader here so the problem
 

2597
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:44,069
left to the reader here so the problem
that we're looking for now

2598
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:44,079

 

2599
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:52,309

is that we're given a directed graph

2600
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:52,319

 

2601
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,670

there's a g in graph case you're

2602
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:53,680
there's a g in graph case you're
 

2603
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,430
there's a g in graph case you're
wondering

2604
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,440
wondering
 

2605
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,430
wondering
but now we don't know if it's a dag or

2606
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
but now we don't know if it's a dag or
 

2607
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,430
but now we don't know if it's a dag or
not and so the question that we're

2608
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
not and so the question that we're
 

2609
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,870
not and so the question that we're
trying to ask

2610
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:00,880
trying to ask
 

2611
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,150
trying to ask
is does there exist

2612
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,160
is does there exist
 

2613
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,710
is does there exist
a cycle in our directed acyclic graph

2614
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:08,720
a cycle in our directed acyclic graph
 

2615
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,230
a cycle in our directed acyclic graph
right so we're just given our graph and

2616
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
right so we're just given our graph and
 

2617
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,109
right so we're just given our graph and
we want to know like can we do this

2618
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:13,119
we want to know like can we do this
 

2619
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,390
we want to know like can we do this
let's think through the logic of this a

2620
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,400
let's think through the logic of this a
 

2621
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,190
let's think through the logic of this a
bit so what do we know we know that

2622
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,200
bit so what do we know we know that
 

2623
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,670
bit so what do we know we know that
if our graph were a dag

2624
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:21,680
if our graph were a dag
 

2625
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,030
if our graph were a dag
then i could call dfs get the ordering

2626
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,040
then i could call dfs get the ordering
 

2627
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,390
then i could call dfs get the ordering
out and then i guess flip it it's

2628
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
out and then i guess flip it it's
 

2629
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,390
out and then i guess flip it it's
ordering backwards so i could compute

2630
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:28,400
ordering backwards so i could compute
 

2631
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,230
ordering backwards so i could compute
uh the reverse finishing order and it

2632
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,240
uh the reverse finishing order and it
 

2633
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,069
uh the reverse finishing order and it
would give me a topological order of my

2634
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:32,079
would give me a topological order of my
 

2635
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,750
would give me a topological order of my
graph

2636
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
graph
 

2637
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,470
graph
right so if i were a dag i would get a

2638
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
right so if i were a dag i would get a
 

2639
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,550
right so if i were a dag i would get a
topological order when i called dfs

2640
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:40,560
topological order when i called dfs
 

2641
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,910
topological order when i called dfs
so let's say that i ran dfs

2642
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:43,920
so let's say that i ran dfs
 

2643
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,630
so let's say that i ran dfs
i got whatever ordering i got and now i

2644
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:46,640
i got whatever ordering i got and now i
 

2645
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,069
i got whatever ordering i got and now i
found an edge that points in the wrong

2646
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
found an edge that points in the wrong
 

2647
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,750
found an edge that points in the wrong
direction i i can i can just double

2648
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:49,760
direction i i can i can just double
 

2649
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,670
direction i i can i can just double
check my list of edges and i find one

2650
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:51,680
check my list of edges and i find one
 

2651
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,589
check my list of edges and i find one
uh that does not respect the

2652
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:53,599
uh that does not respect the
 

2653
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:54,790
uh that does not respect the
relationship that i see in the second

2654
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:54,800
relationship that i see in the second
 

2655
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,510
relationship that i see in the second
bullet point here

2656
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:57,520

 

2657
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,270

can my graph be a dag no because if my

2658
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:01,280
can my graph be a dag no because if my
 

2659
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,790
can my graph be a dag no because if my
graph were a dag

2660
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
graph were a dag
 

2661
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,990
graph were a dag
the algorithm would have worked i just

2662
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,000
the algorithm would have worked i just
 

2663
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,990
the algorithm would have worked i just
proved it to you right so if if there

2664
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,000
proved it to you right so if if there
 

2665
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,790
proved it to you right so if if there
were if my

2666
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:06,800
were if my
 

2667
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,710
were if my
my graph were a tag then i could do a

2668
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:08,720
my graph were a tag then i could do a
 

2669
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,390
my graph were a tag then i could do a
reverse finishing order and what i would

2670
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,400
reverse finishing order and what i would
 

2671
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,109
reverse finishing order and what i would
get back

2672
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:11,119
get back
 

2673
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,030
get back
is a topological order so if i found a

2674
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:13,040
is a topological order so if i found a
 

2675
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,309
is a topological order so if i found a
certificate that my order wasn't

2676
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
certificate that my order wasn't
 

2677
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,430
certificate that my order wasn't
topological

2678
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
topological
 

2679
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,710
topological
something went wrong and the only thing

2680
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:16,720
something went wrong and the only thing
 

2681
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,069
something went wrong and the only thing
that could go wrong is that my graph is

2682
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
that could go wrong is that my graph is
 

2683
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,270
that could go wrong is that my graph is
in a dag

2684
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:19,280
in a dag
 

2685
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,550
in a dag
or yeah it's in a deck in fact uh

2686
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
or yeah it's in a deck in fact uh
 

2687
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,150
or yeah it's in a deck in fact uh
sort of an exercise left to the reader

2688
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
sort of an exercise left to the reader
 

2689
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,069
sort of an exercise left to the reader
and or to your section do we still have

2690
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,079
and or to your section do we still have
 

2691
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,109
and or to your section do we still have
section i think we do as of now um is

2692
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:29,119
section i think we do as of now um is
 

2693
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,910
section i think we do as of now um is
that this is an if and only if

2694
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:31,920
that this is an if and only if
 

2695
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,309
that this is an if and only if
meaning that the only time that you even

2696
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
meaning that the only time that you even
 

2697
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,829
meaning that the only time that you even
have a topological ordering in your

2698
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:35,839
have a topological ordering in your
 

2699
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,950
have a topological ordering in your
graph

2700
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:36,960
graph
 

2701
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,589
graph
is if your graph is a dac this is a

2702
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:39,599
is if your graph is a dac this is a
 

2703
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,589
is if your graph is a dac this is a
really easy fact to sanity check by the

2704
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:41,599
really easy fact to sanity check by the
 

2705
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,870
really easy fact to sanity check by the
way so it's not not like a particularly

2706
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
way so it's not not like a particularly
 

2707
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,230
way so it's not not like a particularly
challenging problem but you should

2708
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,240
challenging problem but you should
 

2709
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,190
challenging problem but you should
think through it because it's a good

2710
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,200
think through it because it's a good
 

2711
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,630
think through it because it's a good
exercise to make sure you understand the

2712
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
exercise to make sure you understand the
 

2713
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,990
exercise to make sure you understand the
definitions

2714
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
definitions
 

2715
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,910
definitions
which is to say that if you have a

2716
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:49,920
which is to say that if you have a
 

2717
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,990
which is to say that if you have a
topological order your graph is a dag

2718
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,000
topological order your graph is a dag
 

2719
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,829
topological order your graph is a dag
if you don't have a topological order

2720
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:53,839
if you don't have a topological order
 

2721
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,470
if you don't have a topological order
your graph isn't a dag so in other words

2722
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
your graph isn't a dag so in other words
 

2723
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,069
your graph isn't a dag so in other words
we secretly gave you an algorithm

2724
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:58,079
we secretly gave you an algorithm
 

2725
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,550
we secretly gave you an algorithm
for checking if a graph is a dag at all

2726
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:00,560
for checking if a graph is a dag at all
 

2727
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,750
for checking if a graph is a dag at all
right what could i do

2728
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:01,760
right what could i do
 

2729
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,390
right what could i do
i could compute reverse finishing order

2730
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:04,400
i could compute reverse finishing order
 

2731
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,790
i could compute reverse finishing order
check

2732
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
check
 

2733
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,309
check
if it obeys the relationship on the

2734
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:06,319
if it obeys the relationship on the
 

2735
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,309
if it obeys the relationship on the
second bullet point here for every edge

2736
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:08,319
second bullet point here for every edge
 

2737
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,990
second bullet point here for every edge
and if it does then we're in good shape

2738
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,000
and if it does then we're in good shape
 

2739
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,510
and if it does then we're in good shape
my graph is a tag

2740
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,520
my graph is a tag
 

2741
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,030
my graph is a tag
if it doesn't something went wrong and

2742
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,040
if it doesn't something went wrong and
 

2743
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,230
if it doesn't something went wrong and
the only thing that could have gone

2744
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:14,240
the only thing that could have gone
 

2745
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,550
the only thing that could have gone
wrong is not being a dag

2746
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:16,560
wrong is not being a dag
 

2747
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,270
wrong is not being a dag
okay so in other words uh secretly we

2748
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
okay so in other words uh secretly we
 

2749
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,589
okay so in other words uh secretly we
just solved

2750
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:21,599
just solved
 

2751
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,630
just solved
well i guess the way that i've written

2752
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:22,640
well i guess the way that i've written
 

2753
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,270
well i guess the way that i've written
it here we've solved the cycle detection

2754
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
it here we've solved the cycle detection
 

2755
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,309
it here we've solved the cycle detection
problem here which is to say that well i

2756
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
problem here which is to say that well i
 

2757
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,270
problem here which is to say that well i
have a cycle

2758
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280
have a cycle
 

2759
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,910
have a cycle
if and only if i don't i'm not a dag

2760
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:31,920
if and only if i don't i'm not a dag
 

2761
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,670
if and only if i don't i'm not a dag
which i can check using this technique

2762
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:33,680
which i can check using this technique
 

2763
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,270
which i can check using this technique
of course the word detection here

2764
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,280
of course the word detection here
 

2765
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,470
of course the word detection here
probably means that i actually want to

2766
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
probably means that i actually want to
 

2767
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,990
probably means that i actually want to
find that cycle and i haven't told you

2768
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,000
find that cycle and i haven't told you
 

2769
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,109
find that cycle and i haven't told you
how to do that yet

2770
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,119
how to do that yet
 

2771
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,870
how to do that yet
right all we know how to do so far is

2772
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:40,880
right all we know how to do so far is
 

2773
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,870
right all we know how to do so far is
say like yeah somewhere in this graph

2774
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880
say like yeah somewhere in this graph
 

2775
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,109
say like yeah somewhere in this graph
there's a cycle and that's not so good

2776
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
there's a cycle and that's not so good
 

2777
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,030
there's a cycle and that's not so good
um so we can do one additional piece of

2778
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,040
um so we can do one additional piece of
 

2779
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,950
um so we can do one additional piece of
information in the two minutes we have

2780
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
information in the two minutes we have
 

2781
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,750
information in the two minutes we have
remaining

2782
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:49,760
remaining
 

2783
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,750
remaining
to sort of complete our story here which

2784
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:51,760
to sort of complete our story here which
 

2785
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,990
to sort of complete our story here which
is to modify our algorithm ever so

2786
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:54,000
is to modify our algorithm ever so
 

2787
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,630
is to modify our algorithm ever so
slightly

2788
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:54,640
slightly
 

2789
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,309
slightly
to not only say like thumbs up thumbs

2790
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:56,319
to not only say like thumbs up thumbs
 

2791
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,069
to not only say like thumbs up thumbs
down is there a cycle in this graph

2792
00:47:58,069 --> 00:47:58,079
down is there a cycle in this graph
 

2793
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,750
down is there a cycle in this graph
but also to actually return the vertices

2794
00:47:59,750 --> 00:47:59,760
but also to actually return the vertices
 

2795
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,589
but also to actually return the vertices
as a cycle

2796
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
as a cycle
 

2797
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,430
as a cycle
and here's the the property that we're

2798
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:03,440
and here's the the property that we're
 

2799
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,270
and here's the the property that we're
gonna do that which is uh

2800
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:05,280
gonna do that which is uh
 

2801
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,069
gonna do that which is uh
the following which is that if g

2802
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:08,079
the following which is that if g
 

2803
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:14,390
the following which is that if g
contains a cycle

2804
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:14,400

 

2805
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,829

uh

2806
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839

 

2807
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,910

right then a full

2808
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:21,920
right then a full
 

2809
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,950
right then a full
dfs will traverse

2810
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960

 

2811
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,510

an edge from a vertex v

2812
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
an edge from a vertex v
 

2813
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,349
an edge from a vertex v
to some ancestor v

2814
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:37,359

 

2815
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,030

i guess we haven't carefully defined the

2816
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,040
i guess we haven't carefully defined the
 

2817
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,470
i guess we haven't carefully defined the
the term ancestor here

2818
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:40,480
the term ancestor here
 

2819
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,470
the term ancestor here
essentially uh if you think of the sort

2820
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,480
essentially uh if you think of the sort
 

2821
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,230
essentially uh if you think of the sort
of

2822
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,240
of
 

2823
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,470
of
the running of of the dfs algorithm then

2824
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:46,480
the running of of the dfs algorithm then
 

2825
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,910
the running of of the dfs algorithm then
an ancestor is like something that

2826
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920
an ancestor is like something that
 

2827
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,829
an ancestor is like something that
appears in the recursive call tree

2828
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:49,839
appears in the recursive call tree
 

2829
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,109
appears in the recursive call tree
before i got to v okay so how could we

2830
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
before i got to v okay so how could we
 

2831
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,710
before i got to v okay so how could we
prove that

2832
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:54,720
prove that
 

2833
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,829
prove that
well

2834
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839

 

2835
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,150

let's take a cycle

2836
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:02,160
let's take a cycle
 

2837
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,470
let's take a cycle
um and we'll give it a name in

2838
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:04,480
um and we'll give it a name in
 

2839
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,670
um and we'll give it a name in
particular we'll say that it's

2840
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:05,680
particular we'll say that it's
 

2841
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,270
particular we'll say that it's
a cycle from v0 v1

2842
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:09,280
a cycle from v0 v1
 

2843
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,270
a cycle from v0 v1
to vk and then it's a cycle so it goes

2844
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,280
to vk and then it's a cycle so it goes
 

2845
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,710
to vk and then it's a cycle so it goes
back to v0

2846
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:12,720
back to v0
 

2847
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,390
back to v0
okay and i can order this cycle any way

2848
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:16,400
okay and i can order this cycle any way
 

2849
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,630
okay and i can order this cycle any way
i want notice that if i permute

2850
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:18,640
i want notice that if i permute
 

2851
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,470
i want notice that if i permute
the vertices in this list in a cyclical

2852
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:20,480
the vertices in this list in a cyclical
 

2853
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,990
the vertices in this list in a cyclical
way meaning that i like take the last

2854
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:22,000
way meaning that i like take the last
 

2855
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,030
way meaning that i like take the last
few of them and stick them at the

2856
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
few of them and stick them at the
 

2857
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,230
few of them and stick them at the
beginning of the list

2858
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:24,240
beginning of the list
 

2859
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,430
beginning of the list
it's still a cycle it's the nice thing

2860
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
it's still a cycle it's the nice thing
 

2861
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,710
it's still a cycle it's the nice thing
about cycles uh so in particular

2862
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:28,720
about cycles uh so in particular
 

2863
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,109
about cycles uh so in particular
without loss of generality

2864
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119

 

2865
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,390

we're going to assume uh

2866
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,400
we're going to assume uh
 

2867
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,710
we're going to assume uh
that v zero is the first vertex

2868
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:40,720
that v zero is the first vertex
 

2869
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:52,150
that v zero is the first vertex
uh visited by by by dfs

2870
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,160

 

2871
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,430

what does that mean that means like when

2872
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:53,440
what does that mean that means like when
 

2873
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,349
what does that mean that means like when
i do my dfs algorithm making all these

2874
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:55,359
i do my dfs algorithm making all these
 

2875
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,470
i do my dfs algorithm making all these
recursive calls

2876
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,480
recursive calls
 

2877
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,230
recursive calls
the very first vertex to be touched by

2878
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:58,240
the very first vertex to be touched by
 

2879
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,630
the very first vertex to be touched by
this technique is v naught

2880
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
this technique is v naught
 

2881
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,270
this technique is v naught
okay well now what's going to end up

2882
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:03,280
okay well now what's going to end up
 

2883
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,150
okay well now what's going to end up
happening

2884
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:04,160
happening
 

2885
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,230
happening
well think about the recursive call tree

2886
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,240
well think about the recursive call tree
 

2887
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,190
well think about the recursive call tree
starting at v

2888
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:07,200
starting at v
 

2889
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,710
starting at v
zero by the time that completes

2890
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:12,720
zero by the time that completes
 

2891
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,589
zero by the time that completes
anything that's reachable from v zero is

2892
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599
anything that's reachable from v zero is
 

2893
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,870
anything that's reachable from v zero is
also going to be complete do you see

2894
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:16,880
also going to be complete do you see
 

2895
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,150
also going to be complete do you see
that

2896
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,160
that
 

2897
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,990
that
so like for instance v zero somewhere in

2898
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,000
so like for instance v zero somewhere in
 

2899
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,309
so like for instance v zero somewhere in
his call tree might call v one if it

2900
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:22,319
his call tree might call v one if it
 

2901
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,750
his call tree might call v one if it
and notice that v one was not already

2902
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:23,760
and notice that v one was not already
 

2903
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,589
and notice that v one was not already
visited so in fact it will

2904
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:25,599
visited so in fact it will
 

2905
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,630
visited so in fact it will
for v1 i got to call v2 and so on

2906
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
for v1 i got to call v2 and so on
 

2907
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,309
for v1 i got to call v2 and so on
and in particular we're going to get all

2908
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:32,319
and in particular we're going to get all
 

2909
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:32,870
and in particular we're going to get all
the way

2910
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:32,880
the way
 

2911
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,990
the way
to vertex k right

2912
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,000
to vertex k right
 

2913
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,349
to vertex k right
so in other words

2914
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:39,359

 

2915
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,109

we're going to visit vertex v

2916
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:43,119
we're going to visit vertex v
 

2917
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,589
we're going to visit vertex v
k and notice what's going to happen

2918
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:47,599
k and notice what's going to happen
 

2919
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,829
k and notice what's going to happen
so remember our algorithm in fact we

2920
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:49,839
so remember our algorithm in fact we
 

2921
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,030
so remember our algorithm in fact we
should probably just put it up on the

2922
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:51,040
should probably just put it up on the
 

2923
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,230
should probably just put it up on the
screen would be easier

2924
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
screen would be easier
 

2925
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,990
screen would be easier
than talking about it a bunch well

2926
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,000
than talking about it a bunch well
 

2927
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,470
than talking about it a bunch well
v k is now going to iterate over every

2928
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:58,480
v k is now going to iterate over every
 

2929
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,750
v k is now going to iterate over every
one of the neighbors of v

2930
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
one of the neighbors of v
 

2931
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,109
one of the neighbors of v
k and in particular it's going to see

2932
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:03,119
k and in particular it's going to see
 

2933
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,030
k and in particular it's going to see
vertex v naught

2934
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,040
vertex v naught
 

2935
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,630
vertex v naught
right so we're going to see

2936
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,640

 

2937
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,390

the edge from vk to v0

2938
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
the edge from vk to v0
 

2939
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,150
the edge from vk to v0
which is an edge kind of by definition

2940
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
which is an edge kind of by definition
 

2941
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,510
which is an edge kind of by definition
right because we took this to be a cycle

2942
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
right because we took this to be a cycle

here
well notice that's exactly the thing we

2946
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
well notice that's exactly the thing we

well notice that's exactly the thing we
set out to prove right namely that full

dfs
 

2951
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,309
dfs
traverses an edge from a vertex to one

2952
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:26,319
traverses an edge from a vertex to one
 

2953
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,349
traverses an edge from a vertex to one
of its ancestors

2954
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:27,359
of its ancestors
 

2955
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,150

here's the vertex k here's his ancestor

2956
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160
here's the vertex k here's his ancestor
 

2957
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,589
here's the vertex k here's his ancestor
v naught why do we know that it's an

2958
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
v naught why do we know that it's an
 

2959
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,829
v naught why do we know that it's an
ancestor well because v naught

2960
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
ancestor well because v naught
 

2961
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,670

was called in our call tree before any

2962
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:35,680
was called in our call tree before any
 

2963
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,030
was called in our call tree before any
of these other guys

2964
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:37,040
of these other guys
 

2965
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,750
of these other guys
right so we wanted an algorithm that not

2966
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
right so we wanted an algorithm that not
 

2967
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,430
right so we wanted an algorithm that not
only did cycle detection but also

2968
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:41,440
only did cycle detection but also
 

2969
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,790
only did cycle detection but also
actually gave me this cycle

2970
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
actually gave me this cycle
 

2971
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,630
actually gave me this cycle
what could i do well it's essentially a

2972
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:44,640
what could i do well it's essentially a
 

2973
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,990
what could i do well it's essentially a
small modification

2974
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:46,000
small modification
 

2975
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,230
small modification
of what we already have right so whoops

2976
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,240
of what we already have right so whoops
 

2977
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,069
of what we already have right so whoops
uh right if i want to compute

2978
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
uh right if i want to compute
 

2979
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,750
uh right if i want to compute
topological order or whatever i can just

00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
do dfs
 

2983
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,549
do dfs
and that'll tell me like year nay does

2984
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:54,559
and that'll tell me like year nay does
 

2985

their existing cycle if i want to

2986
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
their existing cycle if i want to
 

2987
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,069
their existing cycle if i want to
actually find that cycle all i have to

2988
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:58,079
actually find that cycle all i have to
 

2989
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,910
actually find that cycle all i have to
do is sort of

2990
00:51:59,910 --> 00:51:59,920
do is sort of
 

2991
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,150
do is sort of
check that topological order property at

2992
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
check that topological order property at
 

2993
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,990

the same time that i traverse the graph

2994
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,000
the same time that i traverse the graph
 

2995
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,390
the same time that i traverse the graph
during dfs and the second that i find an

00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
during dfs and the second that i find an
 

2997
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,230
during dfs and the second that i find an
edge that loops back

2998
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:08,240
edge that loops back
 

2999
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,190
edge that loops back
i'm done and so that's our basic

3000
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,200
i'm done and so that's our basic
 

3001
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,230
i'm done and so that's our basic
algorithm here

3002
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,240
algorithm here
 

3003
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,750
algorithm here
and this is a technique for actually
