00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
problem session that we'll be having on
 

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,590
problem session that we'll be having on
fridays this term it's really an

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
fridays this term it's really an
 

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,950
fridays this term it's really an
experiment

12
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
experiment
 

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,830
experiment
we've never done this before but one of

14
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
we've never done this before but one of
 

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,029
we've never done this before but one of
the things that we were discussed while

16
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
the things that we were discussed while
 

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,150
the things that we were discussed while
preparing for this class

18
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
preparing for this class
 

19
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,310
preparing for this class
is that we have two different methods

20
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
is that we have two different methods
 

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,510
is that we have two different methods
of instruction formally usually

22
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
of instruction formally usually
 

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,229
of instruction formally usually
in this class a lecture which is there

24
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
in this class a lecture which is there
 

25
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,830
in this class a lecture which is there
to present you with the fundamental

26
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
to present you with the fundamental
 

27
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,030
to present you with the fundamental
material

28
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
material
 

29
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,709
material
the the data structures and the

30
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
the the data structures and the
 

31
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,229
the the data structures and the
algorithms uh that are

32
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
algorithms uh that are
 

33
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,190
algorithms uh that are
kind of the base the foundation of what

34
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
kind of the base the foundation of what
 

35
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,790
kind of the base the foundation of what
how you will be approaching problems in

36
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
how you will be approaching problems in
 

37
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,910
how you will be approaching problems in
this class

38
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
this class
 

39
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,950
this class
uh and then the problem sets

40
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
uh and then the problem sets
 

41
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,869
uh and then the problem sets
that you will will you will work on our

42
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
that you will will you will work on our
 

43
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,750
that you will will you will work on our
applications of that material but it's

44
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
applications of that material but it's
 

45
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,149
applications of that material but it's
there's usually a much different feel

46
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
there's usually a much different feel
 

47
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,070
there's usually a much different feel
between those problems that we'll give

48
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
between those problems that we'll give
 

49
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,429
between those problems that we'll give
you than the

50
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
you than the
 

51
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,429
you than the
underlying foundational material right

52
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
underlying foundational material right
 

53
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,030
underlying foundational material right
so the application that

54
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
so the application that
 

55
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,109
so the application that
material feel very different and a lot

56
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
material feel very different and a lot
 

57
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,030
material feel very different and a lot
of times there are tricks to approaching

58
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
of times there are tricks to approaching
 

59
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,230
of times there are tricks to approaching
the problems

60
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
the problems
 

61
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,270
the problems
uh or ways of approaching the problems

62
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
uh or ways of approaching the problems
 

63
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,990
uh or ways of approaching the problems
that um you kind of just have to figure

64
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
that um you kind of just have to figure
 

65
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,630
that um you kind of just have to figure
out by

66
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
out by
 

67
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,310
out by
working on the problems sometimes going

68
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
working on the problems sometimes going
 

69
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,070
working on the problems sometimes going
to office hours

70
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
to office hours
 

71
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,630
to office hours
but what we wanted to do this term was

72
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
but what we wanted to do this term was
 

73
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,990
but what we wanted to do this term was
to

74
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
to
 

75
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,590
to
since we had the opportunity to be

76
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
since we had the opportunity to be
 

77
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,350
since we had the opportunity to be
recorded by ocw

78
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
recorded by ocw
 

79
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,710
recorded by ocw
was to record us going through some

80
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
was to record us going through some
 

81
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,710
was to record us going through some
problems that we've had on problem sets

82
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
problems that we've had on problem sets
 

83
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,069
problems that we've had on problem sets
in the past so you could

84
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
in the past so you could
 

85
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,190
in the past so you could
see how we would approach working on

86
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
see how we would approach working on
 

87
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,389
see how we would approach working on
these problems

88
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
these problems
 

89
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,630
these problems
that you'll be working on at least in a

90
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
that you'll be working on at least in a
 

91
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,510
that you'll be working on at least in a
similar vein

92
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
similar vein
 

93
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,510
similar vein
so that's the goal of this these problem

94
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
so that's the goal of this these problem
 

95
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,789
so that's the goal of this these problem
sessions in the past

96
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
sessions in the past
 

97
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,789
sessions in the past
for ocw we have recorded recitation

98
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
for ocw we have recorded recitation
 

99
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,429
for ocw we have recorded recitation
but we felt that that was a little less

100
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
but we felt that that was a little less
 

101
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,950
but we felt that that was a little less
useful to you guys because

102
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
useful to you guys because
 

103
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,749
useful to you guys because
recitation is meant for interaction

104
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
recitation is meant for interaction
 

105
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,350
recitation is meant for interaction
questions one-on-one questions we wanted

questions one-on-one questions we wanted
 

107
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,709
questions one-on-one questions we wanted
to be a safe space

108
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
to be a safe space

okay so uh we do have a handout up here

128
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
okay so uh we do have a handout up here
 

129
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,910
okay so uh we do have a handout up here
by the door

130
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
by the door
 

131
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,869
by the door
um which uh we may or may not have in

132
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
um which uh we may or may not have in
 

133
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,470
um which uh we may or may not have in
the future this is all an experiment so

134
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
the future this is all an experiment so
 

135
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,309
the future this is all an experiment so
you'll have to work with us as we

136
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
you'll have to work with us as we
 

137
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,550
you'll have to work with us as we
figure this stuff out um they were

138
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
figure this stuff out um they were
 

139
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,990
figure this stuff out um they were
posted on uh

140
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
posted on uh
 

141
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,869
posted on uh
elmod about an hour before this session

142
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
elmod about an hour before this session
 

143
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,750
elmod about an hour before this session
we'll try to

144
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
we'll try to
 

145
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,869
we'll try to
keep that uh as a standard

146
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
keep that uh as a standard
 

147
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,190
keep that uh as a standard
uh but it just shows you the the

148
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
uh but it just shows you the the
 

149
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,869
uh but it just shows you the the
questions we'll work on

150
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
questions we'll work on
 

151
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,309
questions we'll work on
uh today in the in the session

152
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
uh today in the in the session
 

153
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,390
uh today in the in the session
it won't necessarily be the entire it's

154
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
it won't necessarily be the entire it's
 

155
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,750
it won't necessarily be the entire it's
it isn't just

156
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
it isn't just
 

157
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,670
it isn't just
the problem set from last term it's a

158
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
the problem set from last term it's a
 

159
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,110
the problem set from last term it's a
selection of problems from previous

160
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
selection of problems from previous
 

161
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,750
selection of problems from previous
terms

162
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
terms
 

163
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,589
terms
and some of them have been edited to be

164
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
and some of them have been edited to be
 

165
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,949
and some of them have been edited to be
maybe a little shorter and things like

166
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
maybe a little shorter and things like
 

167
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,750
maybe a little shorter and things like
that

168
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
that
 

169
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,309
that
um so what we're going to do is just go

170
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
um so what we're going to do is just go
 

171
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,070
um so what we're going to do is just go
through the problems one by one i'll try

172
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
through the problems one by one i'll try
 

173
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,869
through the problems one by one i'll try
to just

174
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
to just
 

175
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,190
to just
kind of show you how i'm approaching the

176
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
kind of show you how i'm approaching the
 

177
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,990
kind of show you how i'm approaching the
problems

178
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
problems
 

179
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,910
problems
uh but at any point if you want to you

180
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
uh but at any point if you want to you
 

181
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,830
uh but at any point if you want to you
can ask questions that's fine

182
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
can ask questions that's fine
 

183
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,110
can ask questions that's fine
okay all right so the first question we

184
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
okay all right so the first question we
 

185
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,509
okay all right so the first question we
have

186
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
have
 

187
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,550
have
is has a setup that's very similar to

188
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
is has a setup that's very similar to
 

189
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,110
is has a setup that's very similar to
what you will have on your pset one

190
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
what you will have on your pset one
 

191
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,470
what you will have on your pset one
it's essentially saying that uh it has

192
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
it's essentially saying that uh it has
 

193
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,430
it's essentially saying that uh it has
it is

194
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
it is
 

195
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,550
it is
usually many parts this has two parts an

196
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
usually many parts this has two parts an
 

197
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,910
usually many parts this has two parts an
a part and a d part uh i've i've omitted

198
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
a part and a d part uh i've i've omitted
 

199
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,470
a part and a d part uh i've i've omitted
a b and a c that that was on last term's

200
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
a b and a c that that was on last term's
 

201
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,270
a b and a c that that was on last term's
problem set

202
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
problem set
 

203
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,229
problem set
and it has five functions each and

204
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
and it has five functions each and
 

205
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,350
and it has five functions each and
you're trying to

206
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
you're trying to
 

207
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,470
you're trying to
order them increasing asym

208
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
order them increasing asym
 

209
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,190
order them increasing asym
based on their asymptotic behavior so

210
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
based on their asymptotic behavior so
 

211
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,869
based on their asymptotic behavior so
here are the uh

212
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
here are the uh
 

213
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,270
here are the uh
the functions that we have uh maybe i'll

214
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
the functions that we have uh maybe i'll
 

215
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,070
the functions that we have uh maybe i'll
stick it up

216
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
stick it up
 

217
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,229
stick it up
instead

218
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239

 

219
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,710

all right so we have a few sets of

220
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
all right so we have a few sets of
 

221
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,630
all right so we have a few sets of
functions and we just want to order them

222
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
functions and we just want to order them
 

223
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,710
functions and we just want to order them
and some of the the functions may be

224
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
and some of the the functions may be
 

225
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,750
and some of the the functions may be
uh asymptotically equivalent right in

226
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
uh asymptotically equivalent right in
 

227
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,589
uh asymptotically equivalent right in
which case when we are ordering these

228
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
which case when we are ordering these
 

229
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,149
which case when we are ordering these
things

230
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
things
 

231
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,990
things
we're going to put those numbers in a in

232
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
we're going to put those numbers in a in
 

233
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,509
we're going to put those numbers in a in
a set so what we have is

234
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
a set so what we have is
 

235
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,710
a set so what we have is
as an example are three functions

236
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
as an example are three functions
 

237
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,469
as an example are three functions
uh n uh root n

238
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
uh n uh root n
 

239
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,830
uh n uh root n
and n plus root n this is one two

240
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
and n plus root n this is one two
 

241
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,670
and n plus root n this is one two
three and what we're going to ask you to

242
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
three and what we're going to ask you to
 

243
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,469
three and what we're going to ask you to
do is order those functions

244
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
do is order those functions
 

245
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,629
do is order those functions
uh based on their asymptotic complexity

246
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
uh based on their asymptotic complexity
 

247
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,270
uh based on their asymptotic complexity
so hopefully you guys can get this one

248
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
so hopefully you guys can get this one
 

249
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,590
so hopefully you guys can get this one
which one's the slowest growth in term

250
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
which one's the slowest growth in term
 

251
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,710
which one's the slowest growth in term
root n so number two so if we say

252
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
root n so number two so if we say
 

253
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,990
root n so number two so if we say
f of two will be our first one and then

254
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
f of two will be our first one and then
 

255
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,510
f of two will be our first one and then
how about the other two they're the same

256
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
how about the other two they're the same
 

257
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,550
how about the other two they're the same
they're both

258
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
they're both
 

259
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,749
they're both
order n right so we would put in set

260
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
order n right so we would put in set
 

261
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,950
order n right so we would put in set
brackets

262
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
brackets
 

263
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,629

if you put just two and one and three

266
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
if you put just two and one and three
 

267
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,870
if you put just two and one and three
here that would probably be fine

268
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
here that would probably be fine
 

269
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,909
here that would probably be fine
okay but if you were to put two over

270
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
okay but if you were to put two over
 

271
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,790
okay but if you were to put two over
here

272
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
here
 

273
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,909
here
or not have these curly braces

274
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
or not have these curly braces
 

275
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,469
or not have these curly braces
around here those would not be correct

276
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
around here those would not be correct
 

277
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,909
around here those would not be correct
and you'd get points marked off

278
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
and you'd get points marked off
 

279
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,950
and you'd get points marked off
does that make sense okay so we're going

280
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
does that make sense okay so we're going
 

281
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,749
does that make sense okay so we're going
to approach the first set of problems

282
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
to approach the first set of problems
 

283
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,990
to approach the first set of problems
first set of functions which is a little

284
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
first set of functions which is a little
 

285
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,590
first set of functions which is a little
different than the second set of

286
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
different than the second set of
 

287
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,029
different than the second set of
functions hopefully this one's a little

288
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
functions hopefully this one's a little
 

289
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,990
functions hopefully this one's a little
easier

290
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000

 

291
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,909

one of the common approaches that i have

292
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
one of the common approaches that i have
 

293
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,110
one of the common approaches that i have
in going through these

294
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
in going through these
 

295
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,310
in going through these
things some of these are in a form that

296
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
things some of these are in a form that
 

297
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,950
things some of these are in a form that
is hard for me to tell

298
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
is hard for me to tell
 

299
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,430
is hard for me to tell
how they would compare to other things

300
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
how they would compare to other things
 

301
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,790
how they would compare to other things
actually most of these are

302
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
actually most of these are
 

303
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,070
actually most of these are
are fine but in general does can can

304
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
are fine but in general does can can
 

305
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,909
are fine but in general does can can
anyone just buy eyeballing

306
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
anyone just buy eyeballing
 

307
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,990
anyone just buy eyeballing
tell me an order that that works for

308
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
tell me an order that that works for
 

309
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,670
tell me an order that that works for
them

310
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680

 

311
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,749

yeah um okay this is a little

312
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
yeah um okay this is a little
 

313
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,430
yeah um okay this is a little
a little difficult to do on the spot

314
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
a little difficult to do on the spot
 

315
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,830
a little difficult to do on the spot
with five functions

316
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840

 

317
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,629

okay

318
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639

 

319
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,870

okay great that's that's excellent so

320
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
okay great that's that's excellent so
 

321
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,230
okay great that's that's excellent so
what we've got here

322
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
what we've got here
 

323
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,990
what we've got here
is on f2 f3 and f5

324
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
is on f2 f3 and f5
 

325
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,390
is on f2 f3 and f5
we kind of have this n leading term if

326
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
we kind of have this n leading term if
 

327
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,350
we kind of have this n leading term if
we factor an n

328
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
we factor an n
 

329
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,390
we factor an n
out of that then we're comparing log

330
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
out of that then we're comparing log
 

331
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,350
out of that then we're comparing log
with a

332
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
with a
 

333
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,670
with a
you know basically we look over here at

334
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
you know basically we look over here at
 

335
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,350
you know basically we look over here at
the polynomial function

336
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
the polynomial function
 

337
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,909
the polynomial function
right this one's smallest out of them

338
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
right this one's smallest out of them
 

339
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,070
right this one's smallest out of them
and then the log factor

340
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
and then the log factor
 

341
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,909
and then the log factor
is smaller than a polynomial factor

342
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
is smaller than a polynomial factor
 

343
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,390
is smaller than a polynomial factor
right log grows slower than linear

344
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
right log grows slower than linear
 

345
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,430
right log grows slower than linear
right and so this guy

346
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
right and so this guy
 

347
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,150
right and so this guy
is smaller than f2 is smaller than f3

348
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
is smaller than f2 is smaller than f3
 

349
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,710
is smaller than f2 is smaller than f3
that's

350
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
that's
 

351
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,670
that's
great that your colleague said um in

352
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
great that your colleague said um in
 

353
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,629
great that your colleague said um in

this nice uh you know

360
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
this nice uh you know
 

361
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,830
this nice uh you know
fact i guess that a

362
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

 

363
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,990

is

364
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
is
 

365
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,589
is
is less than asymptotically this

366
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
is less than asymptotically this
 

367
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,990
is less than asymptotically this
polynomial this log and to any power is

368
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
polynomial this log and to any power is
 

369
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,629
polynomial this log and to any power is
asymptotically less than any polynomial

370
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
asymptotically less than any polynomial
 

371
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,350
asymptotically less than any polynomial
for any

372
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
for any
 

373
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,749
for any
positive a and b and in particular

374
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
positive a and b and in particular
 

375
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,189
positive a and b and in particular
there's actually a stronger thing you

376
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
there's actually a stronger thing you
 

377
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,950
there's actually a stronger thing you
can say which is

378
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
can say which is
 

379
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,029
can say which is

theta right so things that are

390
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
theta right so things that are
 

391
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,390
theta right so things that are
asymptotically

392
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,710
asymptotically
equivalent are not going to be included

394
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
equivalent are not going to be included
 

395
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,629
equivalent are not going to be included
in this set so actually these things are

396
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
in this set so actually these things are
 

397
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,950
in this set so actually these things are
strictly asymptotic grows strictly

398
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960

than any polynomial does that make sense

402
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
than any polynomial does that make sense
 

403
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,909
than any polynomial does that make sense
okay so knowing this

404
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
okay so knowing this
 

405
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,029
okay so knowing this
identity right or this

406
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
identity right or this
 

407
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,430
identity right or this
uh relation can we say anything about f1

408
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440

 

409
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,629

someone maybe maybe someone else any a

410
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
someone maybe maybe someone else any a
 

411
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,029
someone maybe maybe someone else any a
and b

412
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
and b
 

413
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,390
and b
any positive a and b anyone else have a

414
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
any positive a and b anyone else have a
 

415
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,430
any positive a and b anyone else have a
a guess on how yeah uh

416
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
a guess on how yeah uh
 

417
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,950
a guess on how yeah uh
that f1 is less than f1 yeah f1 is less

418
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
that f1 is less than f1 yeah f1 is less
 

419
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,270
that f1 is less than f1 yeah f1 is less
than

420
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
than
 

421
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,950
than
f5 right because just using that

422
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
f5 right because just using that
 

423
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,469
f5 right because just using that
identity this sorry a

424
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
identity this sorry a
 

425
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,029
identity this sorry a
here that i erased stupidly right is

426
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
here that i erased stupidly right is
 

427
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:13,990
here that i erased stupidly right is
smaller than

428
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
smaller than
 

429
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,869
smaller than
say this is small this is bigger than n

430
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
say this is small this is bigger than n
 

431
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,189
say this is small this is bigger than n
right

432
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
right
 

433
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,710
right
and n to the b being one

434
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
and n to the b being one
 

435
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,469
and n to the b being one
is bigger right so uh and then

436
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
is bigger right so uh and then
 

437
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,430
is bigger right so uh and then
as your colleague pointed out before

438
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
as your colleague pointed out before
 

439
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,629
as your colleague pointed out before
this thing is

440
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
this thing is
 

441
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,950
this thing is
exponential so definitely higher than a

442
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
exponential so definitely higher than a
 

443
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,550
exponential so definitely higher than a
polynomial okay so that was very easy

444
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
polynomial okay so that was very easy
 

445
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,509
polynomial okay so that was very easy
right so the

446
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
right so the
 

447
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,709
right so the
the answer here is if i if i got uh if i

448
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
the answer here is if i if i got uh if i
 

449
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,990
the answer here is if i if i got uh if i
remember correctly

450
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
remember correctly
 

451
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,829
remember correctly
f1 f5 f2

452
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
f1 f5 f2
 

453
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,190

454
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
f3 and then f4
 

455
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,350
f3 and then f4
great so that one was pretty easy

456
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
great so that one was pretty easy
 

457
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,470
great so that one was pretty easy
how about b or d

458
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
how about b or d
 

459
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,070
how about b or d
i guess yeah sure

460
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080

 

461
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,670

how would you go about proving that so

462
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
how would you go about proving that so
 

463
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,269
how would you go about proving that so
there is a proof in your recitation

464
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
there is a proof in your recitation
 

465
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,389
there is a proof in your recitation
handout

466
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
handout
 

467
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,910
handout
uh there the the method in which they

468
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
uh there the the method in which they
 

469
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,230
uh there the the method in which they
proved that in the recitation handout

470
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
proved that in the recitation handout
 

471
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,310
proved that in the recitation handout
was putting um

472
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
was putting um
 

473
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,630
was putting um
the the two taking a ratio of the two

474
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
the the two taking a ratio of the two
 

475
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,389
the the two taking a ratio of the two
functions

476
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
functions
 

477
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,990
functions
and taking their limit as n goes to

478
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
and taking their limit as n goes to
 

479
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,430
and taking their limit as n goes to
infinity right

480
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
infinity right
 

481
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,630
infinity right
and if the top one if it goes to it

482
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
and if the top one if it goes to it
 

483
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,509
and if the top one if it goes to it
it grows arbitrarily then the top one

484
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
it grows arbitrarily then the top one
 

485
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,310
it grows arbitrarily then the top one
would be

486
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
would be
 

487
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,190
would be
asymptotic grow absent faster and if the

488
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
asymptotic grow absent faster and if the
 

489
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,590
asymptotic grow absent faster and if the
it

490
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
it
 

491
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,070
it
went to zero the bottom one would grow

492
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
went to zero the bottom one would grow
 

493
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,430
went to zero the bottom one would grow
asymptotically faster

494
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
asymptotically faster
 

495
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,590
asymptotically faster
and if it went to some constant then

496
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
and if it went to some constant then
 

497
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,350
and if it went to some constant then
that would be

498
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
that would be
 

499
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,110
that would be
asymptotically equivalent does that make

500
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
asymptotically equivalent does that make
 

501
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,310
asymptotically equivalent does that make
sense in in actuality to make the

502
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
sense in in actuality to make the
 

503
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,350
sense in in actuality to make the
limit easier to take we take the limit

504
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
limit easier to take we take the limit
 

505
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,430
limit easier to take we take the limit
of the logarithm of the ratio it just

506
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
of the logarithm of the ratio it just
 

507
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,630
of the logarithm of the ratio it just
made it easier

508
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
made it easier
 

509
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,990
made it easier
does that make sense okay

510
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
does that make sense okay
 

511
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,190
does that make sense okay
so let's move on to b b

512
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
so let's move on to b b
 

513
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,590
so let's move on to b b
we have a polynomial and an exponential

514
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
we have a polynomial and an exponential
 

515
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,790
we have a polynomial and an exponential
and then we have these things down here

516
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
and then we have these things down here
 

517
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,670
and then we have these things down here
what do these things in in parentheses

518
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
what do these things in in parentheses
 

519
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,590
what do these things in in parentheses
mean

520
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
mean
 

521
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,150
mean
choose right it's a binomial coefficient

522
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
choose right it's a binomial coefficient
 

523
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,949
choose right it's a binomial coefficient
uh

524
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
uh
 

525
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,310
uh
does anyone know what a binomial

526
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
does anyone know what a binomial
 

527
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,630
does anyone know what a binomial
coefficient is yeah

528
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
coefficient is yeah
 

529
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,470
coefficient is yeah
pro hopefully from o42 or something like

530
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
pro hopefully from o42 or something like
 

531
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,389
pro hopefully from o42 or something like
that or whatever your competition math

532
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
that or whatever your competition math
 

533
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,430
that or whatever your competition math
background is

534
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
background is
 

535
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,910
background is
um but in general we have this

536
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
um but in general we have this
 

537
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,790
um but in general we have this
definition

538
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
definition
 

539
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,030
definition
right this thing is what does anyone

540
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
right this thing is what does anyone
 

541
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,230
right this thing is what does anyone
remember

542
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
remember
 

543
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,350
remember
what does n choose k mean it means

544
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
what does n choose k mean it means
 

545
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,910
what does n choose k mean it means
that yeah to choose k objects

546
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
that yeah to choose k objects
 

547
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,990
that yeah to choose k objects
yeah the number of ways to choose k

548
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
yeah the number of ways to choose k
 

549
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,030
yeah the number of ways to choose k
objects from n

550
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
objects from n
 

551
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,110
objects from n
things right i never remember this

552
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
things right i never remember this
 

553
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,310
things right i never remember this
formula

554
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
formula
 

555
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,110
formula
uh and probably a lot of you have

556
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
uh and probably a lot of you have
 

557
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,430
uh and probably a lot of you have
memorized this formula

558
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
memorized this formula
 

559
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,030
memorized this formula
uh i'm not going to ask you to do it i'm

560
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
uh i'm not going to ask you to do it i'm
 

561
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,470
uh i'm not going to ask you to do it i'm
going to tell you how i

562
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
going to tell you how i
 

563
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,350
going to tell you how i
kind of think about this uh what if i

564
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
kind of think about this uh what if i
 

565
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,230
kind of think about this uh what if i
want to know the

566
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
want to know the
 

567
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,269
want to know the
number of permutations of n choose k

568
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
number of permutations of n choose k
 

569
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,030
number of permutations of n choose k
i mean of of of n so sorry just how many

570
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
i mean of of of n so sorry just how many
 

571
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,069
i mean of of of n so sorry just how many
permutations are there

572
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
permutations are there
 

573
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,190
permutations are there
of n items what is that that's just n

574
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
of n items what is that that's just n
 

575
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,829
of n items what is that that's just n
factorial

576
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
factorial
 

577
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,949
factorial
right so what we do here is we want to

578
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
right so what we do here is we want to
 

579
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,389
right so what we do here is we want to
choose

580
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
choose
 

581
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,350
choose
some n number of things

582
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
some n number of things
 

583
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,829
some n number of things
okay i have n factorial different ways

584
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
okay i have n factorial different ways
 

585
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,269
okay i have n factorial different ways
of choosing those

586
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
of choosing those
 

587
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,230
of choosing those
but then essentially in here and in here

588
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
but then essentially in here and in here
 

589
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,790
but then essentially in here and in here
k and n minus k i don't really care what

590
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
k and n minus k i don't really care what
 

591
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,990
k and n minus k i don't really care what
their order is

592
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
their order is
 

593
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,190
their order is
right so i'm going to divide out

594
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
right so i'm going to divide out
 

595
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,190
right so i'm going to divide out
the permutations of this stuff and this

596
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
the permutations of this stuff and this
 

597
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,269
the permutations of this stuff and this
stuff does that make sense

598
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
stuff does that make sense
 

599
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,389
stuff does that make sense
so the formula here as i remember it

600
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
so the formula here as i remember it
 

601
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,509
so the formula here as i remember it
that hopefully is correct is

602
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
that hopefully is correct is
 

603
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,870
that hopefully is correct is
n minus k factorial right so i'm

604
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
n minus k factorial right so i'm
 

605
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,509
n minus k factorial right so i'm
getting all of the permutations of the

606
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
getting all of the permutations of the
 

607
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,310
getting all of the permutations of the
whole thing

608
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
whole thing
 

609
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,030
whole thing
divided by their constituents does that

610
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
divided by their constituents does that
 

611
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,110
divided by their constituents does that
make sense

612
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
make sense
 

613
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,389
make sense
did i do that right okay cool

614
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
did i do that right okay cool
 

615
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,310
did i do that right okay cool
so that's a nice transformation so the

616
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
so that's a nice transformation so the
 

617
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,829
so that's a nice transformation so the
first step is kind of writing these in

618
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
first step is kind of writing these in
 

619
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,430
first step is kind of writing these in
terms of factorials

620
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
terms of factorials
 

621
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,870
terms of factorials
that doesn't really help me any because

622
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
that doesn't really help me any because
 

623
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,829
that doesn't really help me any because
i don't know how big factorial is base

624
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
i don't know how big factorial is base
 

625
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,150
i don't know how big factorial is base
with respect to these other things does

626
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
with respect to these other things does
 

627
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,829
with respect to these other things does
anyone know how big factorial is

628
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
anyone know how big factorial is
 

629
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,470
anyone know how big factorial is
yeah you can use sterling's

630
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
yeah you can use sterling's
 

631
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,829
yeah you can use sterling's
approximation so that's

632
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
approximation so that's
 

633
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,670
approximation so that's
that's nice does anyone remember what

634
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
that's nice does anyone remember what
 

635
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,230
that's nice does anyone remember what
sterling's approximation is

636
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
sterling's approximation is
 

637
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,629
sterling's approximation is
no i don't remember either i always have

638
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
no i don't remember either i always have
 

639
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,750
no i don't remember either i always have
to look it up

640
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
to look it up
 

641
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,910
to look it up
uh sterling's approximation says

642
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920

 

643
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,509

n factorial is

644
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
n factorial is
 

645
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,990
n factorial is
uh approximately and this approximation

646
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
uh approximately and this approximation
 

647
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,990
uh approximately and this approximation
is much stronger than

648
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
is much stronger than
 

649
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,550
is much stronger than
um uh than an asymptotic behavior

650
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
um uh than an asymptotic behavior
 

651
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,190
um uh than an asymptotic behavior
it's actually as these things as n

652
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
it's actually as these things as n
 

653
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,870
it's actually as these things as n
approaches infinity these things are

654
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
approaches infinity these things are
 

655
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,509
approaches infinity these things are
equal

656
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
equal
 

657
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,230
equal
the limit is the identity uh but the

658
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
the limit is the identity uh but the
 

659
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,509
the limit is the identity uh but the
approximation is

660
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
approximation is
 

661
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,550
approximation is
the square root of 2 pi

662
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
the square root of 2 pi
 

663
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,670
the square root of 2 pi
n n over e to the n

664
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
n n over e to the n
 

665
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,670
n n over e to the n
okay that's fun

666
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680

 

667
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,629

so what kind of growth is this

668
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639

 

669
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,030

super super bad right right it's

670
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
super super bad right right it's
 

671
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,350
super super bad right right it's
it's you know definitely exponential

672
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
it's you know definitely exponential
 

673
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,069
it's you know definitely exponential
it's

674
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
it's
 

675
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,230
it's
higher than exponential it's n to the n

676
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
higher than exponential it's n to the n
 

677
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,190
higher than exponential it's n to the n
something like that

678
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
something like that
 

679
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,550
something like that
dividing out uh an e e this is uh

680
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
dividing out uh an e e this is uh
 

681
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,069
dividing out uh an e e this is uh
you know e right uh the base of the

682
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
you know e right uh the base of the
 

683
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,269
you know e right uh the base of the
natural logarithm

684
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
natural logarithm
 

685
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,269
natural logarithm
right and this is a constant right and

686
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
right and this is a constant right and
 

687
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,030
right and this is a constant right and
so it's pi pi is a constant

688
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
so it's pi pi is a constant
 

689
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,310
so it's pi pi is a constant
kind of interesting that we have two

690
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
kind of interesting that we have two
 

691
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,470
kind of interesting that we have two
transcendental numbers here that's

692
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
transcendental numbers here that's
 

693
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,110
transcendental numbers here that's
that's kind of fun like mathematics i'm

694
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
that's kind of fun like mathematics i'm
 

695
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,829
that's kind of fun like mathematics i'm
sure

696
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
sure
 

697
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,670
sure
some one of your o42 instructors could

698
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
some one of your o42 instructors could
 

699
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,269
some one of your o42 instructors could
tell you why uh

700
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
tell you why uh
 

701
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,230
tell you why uh
i can't right now off the top of my head

702
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
i can't right now off the top of my head
 

703
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,110
i can't right now off the top of my head
but this is

704
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
but this is
 

705
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,030
but this is
this is an approximation that's very

706
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
this is an approximation that's very
 

707
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,230
this is an approximation that's very
good right

708
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
good right
 

709
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,110
good right
and actually uh some sometimes other

710
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
and actually uh some sometimes other
 

711
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,829
and actually uh some sometimes other
people will think

712
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
people will think
 

713
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,509
people will think
this is this is what people call

714
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
this is this is what people call
 

715
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,230
this is this is what people call
sterling's approximation

716
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
sterling's approximation
 

717
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,030
sterling's approximation
one a weaker notion that sometimes is

718
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
one a weaker notion that sometimes is
 

719
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,750
one a weaker notion that sometimes is
useful

720
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
useful
 

721
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,629
useful
for you is uh if you take the logarithm

722
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
for you is uh if you take the logarithm
 

723
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,189
for you is uh if you take the logarithm
of both sides

724
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199

 

725
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:08,870

this is asymptotically what

726
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880

 

727
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,470

if i took the log of this thing

728
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
if i took the log of this thing
 

729
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,790
if i took the log of this thing
it is uh you know a polynomial thing

730
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
it is uh you know a polynomial thing
 

731
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,509
it is uh you know a polynomial thing
it's it's basically n log n right so

732
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
it's it's basically n log n right so
 

733
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,069
it's it's basically n log n right so
it's

734
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
it's
 

735
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,710
it's
if we take a log of this thing it would

736
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
if we take a log of this thing it would
 

737
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,430
if we take a log of this thing it would
be

738
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
be
 

739
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,949
be
uh various things all right let's let's

740
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
uh various things all right let's let's
 

741
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,470
uh various things all right let's let's
do it out

742
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
do it out
 

743
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,509
do it out
2 pi n n over e

744
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
2 pi n n over e
 

745
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,629
2 pi n n over e
to the n so when we're

746
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
to the n so when we're
 

747
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,790
to the n so when we're
inside a logarithm multiplication we can

748
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
inside a logarithm multiplication we can
 

749
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,910
inside a logarithm multiplication we can
split it out

750
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
split it out
 

751
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,590
split it out
becomes addition division becomes

752
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
becomes addition division becomes
 

753
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,430
becomes addition division becomes
subtraction right and this thing

754
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
subtraction right and this thing
 

755
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,590
subtraction right and this thing
grows faster than all these other things

756
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
grows faster than all these other things
 

757
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,350
grows faster than all these other things
so we can ignore them when we

758
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
so we can ignore them when we
 

759
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,670
so we can ignore them when we
add them out asymptotically and so we

760
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
add them out asymptotically and so we
 

761
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,710
add them out asymptotically and so we
end up getting is this

762
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
end up getting is this
 

763
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,030
end up getting is this
n to the n the n comes out on the

764
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
n to the n the n comes out on the
 

765
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,750
n to the n the n comes out on the
logarithm

766
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
logarithm
 

767
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,949
logarithm
and you get something that's theta n

768
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
and you get something that's theta n
 

769
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,949
and you get something that's theta n
log n oh that's fun

770
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
log n oh that's fun
 

771
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,710
log n oh that's fun
this is something we might use later on

772
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
this is something we might use later on
 

773
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,110
this is something we might use later on
in the class okay

774
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
in the class okay
 

775
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,829
in the class okay
okay but when we are comparing these

776
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
okay but when we are comparing these
 

777
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:11,990
okay but when we are comparing these
functions

778
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000

one of the nice things to do is convert

780
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
one of the nice things to do is convert
 

781
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,269
one of the nice things to do is convert
them into

782
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
them into
 

783
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,269
them into
something that's familiar to us so that

784
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
something that's familiar to us so that
 

785
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,710
something that's familiar to us so that
we can compare them easily

786
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
we can compare them easily
 

787
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,750
we can compare them easily
right so here this thing is

788
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
right so here this thing is
 

789
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,509
right so here this thing is
whatever that thing is right roughly

790
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
whatever that thing is right roughly
 

791
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,269
whatever that thing is right roughly
square root n n over e to the n right

792
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
square root n n over e to the n right
 

793
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,230
square root n n over e to the n right
that's

794
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
that's
 

795
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,069
that's
that's the this is uh i'm gonna say

796
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
that's the this is uh i'm gonna say
 

797
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,949
that's the this is uh i'm gonna say
theta okay that's a little bit more

798
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
theta okay that's a little bit more
 

799
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,710
theta okay that's a little bit more
precise

800
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
precise
 

801
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,990
precise
all right then what about these two

802
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
all right then what about these two
 

803
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,470
all right then what about these two
things let's start with the bottom one

804
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
things let's start with the bottom one
 

805
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,389
things let's start with the bottom one
can someone tell me what this is

806
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
can someone tell me what this is
 

807
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,710
can someone tell me what this is
asymptotically yeah

808
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
asymptotically yeah
 

809
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,509
asymptotically yeah
n cubed why is that well if we plug this

810
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
n cubed why is that well if we plug this
 

811
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:49,990
n cubed why is that well if we plug this
stuff

812
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
stuff
 

813
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,350
stuff
into that definition here right we have

814
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
into that definition here right we have
 

815
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,949
into that definition here right we have
n factorial over 3 factorial

816
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
n factorial over 3 factorial
 

817
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,030
n factorial over 3 factorial
n minus 3 factorial right

818
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
n minus 3 factorial right
 

819
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,150
n minus 3 factorial right
n factorial over n minus 3 factorial

820
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
n factorial over n minus 3 factorial
 

821
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,389
n factorial over n minus 3 factorial
just leaves us with an n an n minus 1

822
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
just leaves us with an n an n minus 1
 

823
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,670
just leaves us with an n an n minus 1
and an n minus 2

824
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
and an n minus 2
 

825
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,350
and an n minus 2
over 6 right and if you multiply all

826
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
over 6 right and if you multiply all
 

827
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,310
over 6 right and if you multiply all
that out the leading term is an n cubed

828
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
that out the leading term is an n cubed
 

829
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,910
that out the leading term is an n cubed
right so this thing is

830
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
right so this thing is
 

831
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,590
right so this thing is
asymptotically n cubed i kind of skipped

832
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
asymptotically n cubed i kind of skipped
 

833
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,030
asymptotically n cubed i kind of skipped
some steps but hopefully you could

834
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
some steps but hopefully you could
 

835
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,030
some steps but hopefully you could
follow that

836
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
follow that
 

837
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,550
follow that
okay and then the last thing to

838
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
okay and then the last thing to
 

839
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,310
okay and then the last thing to
remain is this one right there

840
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320

 

841
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,749

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,990
that one's a little tricky
anyone want to help me out here what we

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,710
sterling's approximation to replace the
factorials that make sense okay so what

854
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
factorials that make sense okay so what
 

855
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,430
factorials that make sense okay so what
i'm going to do

856
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
i'm going to do
 

857
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,470
i'm going to do
is let's do this in two steps

858
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
is let's do this in two steps
 

859
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,590
is let's do this in two steps
uh this is going to be n factorial over

860
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600

 

861
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,590

what is this n over 2 factorial and then

862
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
what is this n over 2 factorial and then
 

863
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,790
what is this n over 2 factorial and then
what is n minus

864
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
what is n minus
 

865
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,150
what is n minus
n over 2 that's also n over two so this

866
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
n over 2 that's also n over two so this
 

867
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,309
n over 2 that's also n over two so this
is going to be

868
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
is going to be
 

869
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,590
is going to be
n over two factorial

870
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
n over two factorial
 

871
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,350
n over two factorial
squared is that okay yeah

872
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
squared is that okay yeah
 

873
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,750
squared is that okay yeah
now let's replace this stuff with

874
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
now let's replace this stuff with
 

875
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,510
now let's replace this stuff with
sterling's approximation and see if we

876
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
sterling's approximation and see if we
 

877
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,549
sterling's approximation and see if we
can simplify

878
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
can simplify
 

879
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,750
can simplify
okay so on the top we have 2 pi

880
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
okay so on the top we have 2 pi
 

881
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,189
okay so on the top we have 2 pi
n n over e to the n

882
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
n n over e to the n
 

883
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,270
n n over e to the n
over and then we've got a square here

884
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
over and then we've got a square here
 

885
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,830
over and then we've got a square here
pi n x canceled the two

886
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
pi n x canceled the two
 

887
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,350
pi n x canceled the two
n over two over e to the

888
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
n over two over e to the
 

889
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,310
n over two over e to the
n over two did i do that right

890
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
n over two did i do that right
 

891
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,029
n over two did i do that right
okay i can't spell and a lot of times i

892
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
okay i can't spell and a lot of times i
 

893
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,549
okay i can't spell and a lot of times i
make arithmetic errors so

894
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:46,559
make arithmetic errors so
 

895
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,990
make arithmetic errors so
catch me if i if i am doing one

896
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
catch me if i if i am doing one
 

897
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,510
catch me if i if i am doing one
okay so let's simplify this bottom here

898
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
okay so let's simplify this bottom here
 

899
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,350
okay so let's simplify this bottom here
uh i'm not going to rewrite the top the

900
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
uh i'm not going to rewrite the top the
 

901
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,190
uh i'm not going to rewrite the top the
bottom here we square

902
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
bottom here we square
 

903
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,230
bottom here we square
this guy it's pi times n

904
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
this guy it's pi times n
 

905
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,669
this guy it's pi times n
and then this guy n over 2 squared that

906
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
and then this guy n over 2 squared that
 

907
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,870
and then this guy n over 2 squared that
just stays as an n right

908
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
just stays as an n right
 

909
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,390
just stays as an n right
then we have n over 2

910
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
then we have n over 2
 

911
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,470
then we have n over 2
to the n over e

912
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
to the n over e
 

913
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,470
to the n over e
something like that and over 2 over e to

914
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
something like that and over 2 over e to
 

915
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,990
something like that and over 2 over e to
the n that makes more

916
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
the n that makes more
 

917
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,870
the n that makes more
mean happier okay so now we have this

918
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
mean happier okay so now we have this
 

919
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,510
mean happier okay so now we have this
over this

920
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
over this
 

921
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,870
over this
how do we simplify well we can cancel

922
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
how do we simplify well we can cancel
 

923
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,350
how do we simplify well we can cancel
out

924
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
out
 

925
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,390
out
one of the root n so we've got square

926
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
one of the root n so we've got square
 

927
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,110
one of the root n so we've got square
root

928
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
root
 

929
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,150
root
of pi n down here

930
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,160
of pi n down here
 

931
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,789
of pi n down here
and square root of 2 up top

932
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799

 

933
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,669

and then what do we got we've got

934
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
and then what do we got we've got
 

935
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,230
and then what do we got we've got
n to the n down here and n to the n down

936
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
n to the n down here and n to the n down
 

937
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,909
n to the n down here and n to the n down
up there so those cancel

938
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
up there so those cancel
 

939
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,430
up there so those cancel
we got e 1 over e to the n 1 over e to

940
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
we got e 1 over e to the n 1 over e to
 

941
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,270
we got e 1 over e to the n 1 over e to
the n up there those cancel

942
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
the n up there those cancel
 

943
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,190
the n up there those cancel
what's left in this term when after we

944
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
what's left in this term when after we
 

945
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,789
what's left in this term when after we
cancel

946
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
cancel
 

947
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,190
cancel
uh 1 over 2 to the n in the denominator

948
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
uh 1 over 2 to the n in the denominator
 

949
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,990
uh 1 over 2 to the n in the denominator
right

950
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
right
 

951
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,190
right
which is 2 to the n in the numerator

952
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
which is 2 to the n in the numerator
 

953
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,470
which is 2 to the n in the numerator
okay so this thing is what

954
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
okay so this thing is what
 

955
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,990
okay so this thing is what
this thing is right asymptote we can get

956
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
this thing is right asymptote we can get
 

957
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,990
this thing is right asymptote we can get
rid of these constants and it's root n

958
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
rid of these constants and it's root n
 

959
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,549
rid of these constants and it's root n
it means it's 2 to the n over root n

960
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
it means it's 2 to the n over root n
 

961
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,270
it means it's 2 to the n over root n
asymptotically right

962
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
asymptotically right
 

963
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,669
asymptotically right
does that make sense everybody okay with

964
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
does that make sense everybody okay with
 

965
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,870
does that make sense everybody okay with
that knowledge

966
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
that knowledge
 

967
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,390
that knowledge
and i'm sorry for my messy board work

968
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
and i'm sorry for my messy board work
 

969
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,150
and i'm sorry for my messy board work
uh what is the ordering of these

970
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
uh what is the ordering of these
 

971
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,750
uh what is the ordering of these
functions then can someone

972
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
functions then can someone
 

973
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,430
functions then can someone
help me out someone else

974
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440

 

975
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,470

eric i'm sorry you can't answer come on

976
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
eric i'm sorry you can't answer come on
 

977
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,870
eric i'm sorry you can't answer come on
guys you followed what i said

978
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
guys you followed what i said
 

979
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,029
guys you followed what i said
how about some of the starting start it

980
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
how about some of the starting start it
 

981
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:49,909
how about some of the starting start it
out for me

982
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919

 

983
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,750

right so both of these things are

984
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
right so both of these things are
 

985
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,350
right so both of these things are
asymptotically equivalent so we should

986
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
asymptotically equivalent so we should
 

987
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,070
asymptotically equivalent so we should
put those in brackets

988
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
put those in brackets
 

989
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:06,710
put those in brackets
f2 f5

990
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
f2 f5
 

991
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,350
f2 f5
f3 this one why this one

992
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
f3 this one why this one
 

993
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,590
f3 this one why this one
i'm i'm just asking you to justify what

994
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
i'm i'm just asking you to justify what
 

995
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,350
i'm i'm just asking you to justify what
you're saying

996
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360

 

997
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,470

this one's the biggest

998
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480

 

999
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,270

i don't know if that's f4 f4 is the

1000
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
i don't know if that's f4 f4 is the
 

1001
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,870
i don't know if that's f4 f4 is the
biggest right so this one's definitely

1002
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
biggest right so this one's definitely
 

1003
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,390
biggest right so this one's definitely
bigger than this

1004
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
bigger than this
 

1005
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,630
bigger than this
right because it's n to the n as opposed

1006
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
right because it's n to the n as opposed
 

1007
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,390
right because it's n to the n as opposed
to

1008
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
to
 

1009
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,430
to
two to the n okay

1010
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
two to the n okay
 

1011
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,029
two to the n okay
so for any n larger than 2 plus

1012
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,039
so for any n larger than 2 plus
 

1013
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,470
so for any n larger than 2 plus
e is is you know fairly obvious that

1014
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
e is is you know fairly obvious that
 

1015
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,430
e is is you know fairly obvious that
that's bigger

1016
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
that's bigger
 

1017
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,430
that's bigger
so when have 3 why would f3 be before f1

1018
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
so when have 3 why would f3 be before f1
 

1019
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,350
so when have 3 why would f3 be before f1
but we're dividing by a polynomial

1020
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
but we're dividing by a polynomial
 

1021
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,870
but we're dividing by a polynomial
factor right so

1022
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
factor right so
 

1023
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,909
factor right so
it's going to be uh slower

1024
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
it's going to be uh slower
 

1025
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,310
it's going to be uh slower
asymptotically than than the first one

1026
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
asymptotically than than the first one
 

1027
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,430
asymptotically than than the first one
right there right so

1028
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
right there right so
 

1029
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,750
right there right so
you got it right what is it f3

1030
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
you got it right what is it f3
 

1031
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,909
you got it right what is it f3
f1 and f4

1032
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
f1 and f4
 

1033
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,430
f1 and f4
okay cool so

1034
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
okay cool so
 

1035
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,430
okay cool so
it's a little complicated but you know

1036
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
it's a little complicated but you know
 

1037
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,190
it's a little complicated but you know
just applying some logarithm and

1038
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
just applying some logarithm and
 

1039
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,549
just applying some logarithm and
exponent rules

1040
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
exponent rules
 

1041
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,590
exponent rules
uh understanding that log rhythmic

1042
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:19,600
uh understanding that log rhythmic
 

1043
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,470
uh understanding that log rhythmic
factors grow slower than polynomial ones

1044
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
factors grow slower than polynomial ones
 

1045
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,510
factors grow slower than polynomial ones
and again grow slower than exponential

1046
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
and again grow slower than exponential
 

1047
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:25,990
and again grow slower than exponential
ones

1048
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
ones
 

1049
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,029
ones
and being able to do some

1050
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
and being able to do some
 

1051
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,470
and being able to do some
transformations of some of these

1052
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
transformations of some of these
 

1053
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,310
transformations of some of these
mathematical quantities to get them in a

1054
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
mathematical quantities to get them in a
 

1055
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,350
mathematical quantities to get them in a
polynomial

1056
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
polynomial
 

1057
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,149
polynomial
like looking form is how you're going to

1058
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
like looking form is how you're going to
 

1059
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:34,710
like looking form is how you're going to
approach

1060
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
approach
 

1061
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,110
approach
these problems does that make sense all

1062
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
these problems does that make sense all
 

1063
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,830
these problems does that make sense all
right so

1064
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
right so
 

1065
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,430
right so
we're going to move on to question

1066
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
we're going to move on to question
 

1067
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:51,669
we're going to move on to question
tuna yeah you've got a question

1068
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679

 

1069
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,909

so it's just that i don't i don't know

1070
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
so it's just that i don't i don't know
 

1071
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,669
so it's just that i don't i don't know
how to simplify that any further

1072
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
how to simplify that any further
 

1073
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,669
how to simplify that any further
right you've got a polynomial factor

1074
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
right you've got a polynomial factor
 

1075
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,950
right you've got a polynomial factor
here and then this is an

1076
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
here and then this is an
 

1077
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,630
here and then this is an
n to the n term divided by an

1078
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
n to the n term divided by an
 

1079
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:09,510
n to the n term divided by an
exponential okay

1080
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520

 

1081
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,789

f3 took this uh this

1082
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
f3 took this uh this
 

1083
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,909
f3 took this uh this
little cycle here okay what we did was

1084
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
little cycle here okay what we did was
 

1085
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,630
little cycle here okay what we did was
we

1086
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
we
 

1087
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,029
we
probably we uh expanded out the

1088
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
probably we uh expanded out the
 

1089
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,630
probably we uh expanded out the
definition

1090
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
definition
 

1091
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,430
definition
of the binomial coefficient here then we

1092
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
of the binomial coefficient here then we
 

1093
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,630
of the binomial coefficient here then we
applied sterling

1094
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
applied sterling
 

1095
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,710
applied sterling
and then we simplified and got back does

1096
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
and then we simplified and got back does
 

1097
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,830
and then we simplified and got back does
that make sense

1098
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
that make sense
 

1099
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,909
that make sense
yeah sure is there a reason

1100
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919

 

1101
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,590

why is f3 before f1 right so this is

1102
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
why is f3 before f1 right so this is
 

1103
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,190
why is f3 before f1 right so this is
if i erase the 2 and the pi

1104
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
if i erase the 2 and the pi
 

1105
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,029
if i erase the 2 and the pi
this thing is theta of that 2 to the n

1106
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
this thing is theta of that 2 to the n
 

1107
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,630
this thing is theta of that 2 to the n
over a polynomial factor right it's over

1108
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
over a polynomial factor right it's over
 

1109
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,669
over a polynomial factor right it's over
n to the one-half right n

1110
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
n to the one-half right n
 

1111
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,590
n to the one-half right n
to the one-half grows uh non-trivially

1112
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
to the one-half grows uh non-trivially
 

1113
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,830
to the one-half grows uh non-trivially
right right and so this is going to

1114
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
right right and so this is going to
 

1115
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,669
right right and so this is going to
decrease the running time of this thing

1116
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
decrease the running time of this thing
 

1117
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,110
decrease the running time of this thing
by a polynomial factor

1118
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
by a polynomial factor
 

1119
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,110
by a polynomial factor
right you could think about a we're

1120
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
right you could think about a we're
 

1121
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,630
right you could think about a we're
multiplying this by a

1122
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
multiplying this by a
 

1123
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,870
multiplying this by a
n to the minus one-half as well right

1124
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
n to the minus one-half as well right
 

1125
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,430
n to the minus one-half as well right
that's another way of thinking about it

1126
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
that's another way of thinking about it
 

1127
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,750
that's another way of thinking about it
any other questions okay

1128
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
any other questions okay
 

1129
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,750
any other questions okay
so we're going to move on to

1130
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760

 

1131
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,270

problem two i guess i need a

1132
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
problem two i guess i need a
 

1133
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,390
problem two i guess i need a
an eraser

1134
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400

 

1135
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,029

so problem two is kind of a funny

1136
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
so problem two is kind of a funny
 

1137
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,830
so problem two is kind of a funny
looking problem

1138
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840
looking problem
 

1139
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,190
looking problem
uh the point of this problem is

1140
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
uh the point of this problem is
 

1141
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,350
uh the point of this problem is
uh kind of to get you to think about

1142
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360
uh kind of to get you to think about
 

1143
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,630
uh kind of to get you to think about
using some of the things we're going to

1144
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
using some of the things we're going to
 

1145
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,029
using some of the things we're going to
be using in this class as a black box

1146
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
be using in this class as a black box
 

1147
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,310
be using in this class as a black box
if you if you using something as black

1148
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
if you if you using something as black
 

1149
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,390
if you if you using something as black
box means is that it has a kind of a

1150
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
box means is that it has a kind of a
 

1151
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,230
box means is that it has a kind of a
public interface that you're allowed to

1152
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
public interface that you're allowed to
 

1153
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,510
public interface that you're allowed to
work with but

1154
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
work with but
 

1155
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,029
work with but
i'm not allowed to see what's inside of

1156
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
i'm not allowed to see what's inside of
 

1157
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,510
i'm not allowed to see what's inside of
it right and a lot of times what we'll

1158
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
it right and a lot of times what we'll
 

1159
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,710
it right and a lot of times what we'll
do in this class

1160
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:00,720
do in this class
 

1161
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,630
do in this class
is try to use a black box and just

1162
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
is try to use a black box and just
 

1163
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,430
is try to use a black box and just
try to use the abstracted outer

1164
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
try to use the abstracted outer
 

1165
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,549
try to use the abstracted outer
functions

1166
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
functions
 

1167
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,390
functions
uh so that we can prove things about it

1168
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
uh so that we can prove things about it
 

1169
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,350
uh so that we can prove things about it
right we can just accept those as true

1170
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
right we can just accept those as true
 

1171
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,310
right we can just accept those as true
and then use those to to deal with our

1172
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
and then use those to to deal with our
 

1173
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,070
and then use those to to deal with our
analysis so what we're given in this

1174
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
analysis so what we're given in this
 

1175
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,789
analysis so what we're given in this
problem

1176
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
problem
 

1177
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,750
problem
is a data structure supporting um

1178
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
is a data structure supporting um
 

1179
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,590
is a data structure supporting um
a sequence interface that you heard

1180
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
a sequence interface that you heard
 

1181
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,029
a sequence interface that you heard
about yesterday right

1182
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
about yesterday right
 

1183
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,230
about yesterday right
what's the sequence interface again it

1184
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
what's the sequence interface again it
 

1185
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,909
what's the sequence interface again it
what is a sequence interval how does it

1186
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:31,919
what is a sequence interval how does it
 

1187
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,909
what is a sequence interval how does it
store items

1188
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919
store items
 

1189
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,029
store items
anyone remember yeah

1190
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
anyone remember yeah
 

1191
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,630
anyone remember yeah
in in well it okay

1192
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
in in well it okay
 

1193
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,110
in in well it okay
all right so so what your your colleague

1194
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120
all right so so what your your colleague
 

1195
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,390
all right so so what your your colleague
is saying here is

1196
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400
is saying here is
 

1197
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,190
is saying here is
we list them in a contiguous array okay

1198
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
we list them in a contiguous array okay
 

1199
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,390
we list them in a contiguous array okay
does anyone have a problem with that

1200
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
does anyone have a problem with that
 

1201
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,070
does anyone have a problem with that
definition

1202
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080
definition
 

1203
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,950
definition
yeah up there

1204
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960

 

1205
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,590

okay if you use the link so um one of

1206
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
okay if you use the link so um one of
 

1207
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,070
okay if you use the link so um one of
the

1208
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,080
the
 

1209
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,350
the
the important things about this class

1210
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
the important things about this class
 

1211
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,750
the important things about this class
is abstracting this idea of an interface

1212
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
is abstracting this idea of an interface
 

1213
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,590
is abstracting this idea of an interface
versus an implementation and so

1214
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
versus an implementation and so
 

1215
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,830
versus an implementation and so
what this student down here said is

1216
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:07,840
what this student down here said is
 

1217
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,909
what this student down here said is
talking to me about an array

1218
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
talking to me about an array
 

1219
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,310
talking to me about an array
as an underlying implementation and what

1220
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
as an underlying implementation and what
 

1221
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,830
as an underlying implementation and what
the student back there was talking about

1222
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:13,840
the student back there was talking about
 

1223
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,789
the student back there was talking about
is a linked list

1224
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
is a linked list
 

1225
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,789
is a linked list
these are both things that can implement

1226
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
these are both things that can implement
 

1227
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,909
these are both things that can implement
that interface

1228
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
that interface
 

1229
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,630
that interface
right but in reality the interface is

1230
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
right but in reality the interface is
 

1231
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,190
right but in reality the interface is
something

1232
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
something
 

1233
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,909
something
abstracted outside of those ideas we

1234
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
abstracted outside of those ideas we
 

1235
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,029
abstracted outside of those ideas we
could implement

1236
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
could implement
 

1237
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,710
could implement
with either of those data structures

1238
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
with either of those data structures
 

1239
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,470
with either of those data structures
right so

1240
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
right so
 

1241
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,789
right so
what makes the sequence interface a

1242
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
what makes the sequence interface a
 

1243
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,310
what makes the sequence interface a
sequence interface yeah an order

1244
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
sequence interface yeah an order
 

1245
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,830
sequence interface yeah an order
or at least an index specific way that

1246
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
or at least an index specific way that
 

1247
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,990
or at least an index specific way that
allows for calling though

1248
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
allows for calling though
 

1249
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,230
allows for calling though
so so it's about the data right that

1250
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
so so it's about the data right that
 

1251
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,350
so so it's about the data right that
we're storing right

1252
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,360
we're storing right
 

1253
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,549
we're storing right
the data that we're storing we're

1254
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
the data that we're storing we're
 

1255
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,870
the data that we're storing we're
storing some number of things

1256
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
storing some number of things
 

1257
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,990
storing some number of things
right and the important thing is that

1258
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,000
right and the important thing is that
 

1259
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,710
right and the important thing is that
the data structure is maintaining being

1260
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
the data structure is maintaining being
 

1261
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,669
the data structure is maintaining being
able to

1262
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:51,679
able to
 

1263
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,710
able to
find items in that set by

1264
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
find items in that set by
 

1265
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,750
find items in that set by
by maintaining an order on them right

1266
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
by maintaining an order on them right
 

1267
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,830
by maintaining an order on them right
i usually like to call it an extrinsic

1268
00:25:59,830 --> 00:25:59,840
i usually like to call it an extrinsic
 

1269
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,110
i usually like to call it an extrinsic
order on these things right

1270
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
order on these things right
 

1271
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,710
order on these things right
it has nothing to do with what the items

1272
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
it has nothing to do with what the items
 

1273
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,190
it has nothing to do with what the items
are right it has to do with how

1274
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
are right it has to do with how
 

1275
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,870
are right it has to do with how
i put them in order there's a first

1276
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880
i put them in order there's a first
 

1277
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,549
i put them in order there's a first
thing there's a tenth thing there's a

1278
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
thing there's a tenth thing there's a
 

1279
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,269
thing there's a tenth thing there's a
last thing

1280
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:09,279
last thing
 

1281
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,029
last thing
right that's what a sequence of items is

1282
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
right that's what a sequence of items is
 

1283
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,070
right that's what a sequence of items is
right and so uh what this data structure

1284
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,080
right and so uh what this data structure
 

1285
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,029
right and so uh what this data structure
is doing

1286
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:17,039
is doing
 

1287
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,310
is doing
that's the input that is the kind of uh

1288
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,320
that's the input that is the kind of uh
 

1289
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,070
that's the input that is the kind of uh
what we have available to us in this

1290
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
what we have available to us in this
 

1291
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,070
what we have available to us in this
problem is some kind of data

1292
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,080
problem is some kind of data
 

1293
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,990
problem is some kind of data
structure storing a sequence of things

1294
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
structure storing a sequence of things
 

1295
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,310
structure storing a sequence of things
and it can support these four operations

1296
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:30,320
and it can support these four operations
 

1297
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,310
and it can support these four operations
right and insert first

1298
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
right and insert first
 

1299
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,149
right and insert first
insert last delete first and delete last

1300
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
insert last delete first and delete last
 

1301
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,750
insert last delete first and delete last
and it supports each of those things in

1302
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:37,760
and it supports each of those things in
 

1303
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,190
and it supports each of those things in
constant time

1304
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
constant time
 

1305
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,149
constant time
okay you don't know a data structure

1306
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
okay you don't know a data structure
 

1307
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,350
okay you don't know a data structure
that does that

1308
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
that does that
 

1309
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,029
that does that
yet you will on your problem set one

1310
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
yet you will on your problem set one
 

1311
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,430
yet you will on your problem set one
and we'll talk about another way to do

1312
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440
and we'll talk about another way to do
 

1313
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,149
and we'll talk about another way to do
that

1314
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
that
 

1315
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,590
that
today um but we we don't care how it's

1316
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
today um but we we don't care how it's
 

1317
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,310
today um but we we don't care how it's
implemented

1318
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
implemented
 

1319
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,990
implemented
we just give you this black box that

1320
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000
we just give you this black box that
 

1321
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,669
we just give you this black box that
achieves these things yay

1322
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
achieves these things yay
 

1323
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,390
achieves these things yay
awesome uh and so what we're trying to

1324
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
awesome uh and so what we're trying to
 

1325
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,110
awesome uh and so what we're trying to
do is

1326
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
do is
 

1327
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,070
do is
we have this thing right and i want to

1328
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
we have this thing right and i want to
 

1329
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,710
we have this thing right and i want to
be able to

1330
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
be able to
 

1331
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,950
be able to
manipulate the sequence stored inside

1332
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
manipulate the sequence stored inside
 

1333
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,430
manipulate the sequence stored inside
but all i have access to

1334
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
but all i have access to
 

1335
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,549
but all i have access to
are these external operations okay

1336
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
are these external operations okay
 

1337
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:18,149
are these external operations okay
so the idea is going to be let's

1338
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159

 

1339
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,230

implement algorithms for these some

1340
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,240
implement algorithms for these some
 

1341
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,070
implement algorithms for these some
higher level operations

1342
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
higher level operations
 

1343
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,470
higher level operations
in terms of these lower level things

1344
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
in terms of these lower level things
 

1345
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,669
in terms of these lower level things
that are given to us does that make

1346
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
that are given to us does that make
 

1347
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,470
that are given to us does that make
sense

1348
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
sense
 

1349
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,110
sense
okay and this is actually a pretty easy

1350
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,120
okay and this is actually a pretty easy
 

1351
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,590
okay and this is actually a pretty easy
question

1352
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
question
 

1353
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,269
question
hopefully we'll have slightly more

1354
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:31,279
hopefully we'll have slightly more
 

1355
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,750
hopefully we'll have slightly more
difficult ones for you on

1356
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760
difficult ones for you on
 

1357
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,710
difficult ones for you on
in a different context uh on problem set

1358
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
in a different context uh on problem set
 

1359
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,110
in a different context uh on problem set
one

1360
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
one
 

1361
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,230
one
okay so uh the first uh operation we're

1362
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
okay so uh the first uh operation we're
 

1363
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,990
okay so uh the first uh operation we're
going to support

1364
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,000
going to support
 

1365
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,190
going to support
or try to support uh is an

1366
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
or try to support uh is an
 

1367
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,230
or try to support uh is an
operation called swap ends

1368
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
operation called swap ends
 

1369
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,389
operation called swap ends
okay and what this is going to do is

1370
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:50,399
okay and what this is going to do is
 

1371
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,230
okay and what this is going to do is
take the data structure that we gave

1372
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
take the data structure that we gave
 

1373
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,070
take the data structure that we gave
another way you could do this is put

1374
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
another way you could do this is put
 

1375
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,070
another way you could do this is put
this as a method on that data structure

1376
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
this as a method on that data structure
 

1377
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,630
this as a method on that data structure
but

1378
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
but
 

1379
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,149
but
let's do this separately it's going to

1380
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
let's do this separately it's going to
 

1381
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,789
let's do this separately it's going to
take that data structure that we gave

1382
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:00,799
take that data structure that we gave
 

1383
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,669
take that data structure that we gave
i gave you that's storing the sequence

1384
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679

 

1385
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,430

as the only argument and what is going

1386
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
as the only argument and what is going
 

1387
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,350
as the only argument and what is going
to what we're asking you to do

1388
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360
to what we're asking you to do
 

1389
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,990
to what we're asking you to do
is describe an algorithm to swap the

1390
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
is describe an algorithm to swap the
 

1391
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,830
is describe an algorithm to swap the
first and the last items

1392
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
first and the last items
 

1393
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,950
first and the last items
okay so i i mean i

1394
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
okay so i i mean i
 

1395
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,029
okay so i i mean i
if it's if it was an array i could just

1396
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
if it's if it was an array i could just
 

1397
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,630
if it's if it was an array i could just
look at index 0

1398
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
look at index 0
 

1399
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,029
look at index 0
look at that look at the last one look

1400
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,039
look at that look at the last one look
 

1401
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,230
look at that look at the last one look
at that and swap them

1402
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
at that and swap them
 

1403
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,190
at that and swap them
okay but i don't have access to what

1404
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,200
okay but i don't have access to what
 

1405
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,750
okay but i don't have access to what
that underlying representation is so

1406
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
that underlying representation is so
 

1407
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,630
that underlying representation is so
how would i do that using the the things

1408
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:32,640
how would i do that using the the things
 

1409
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,750
how would i do that using the the things
that we have

1410
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
that we have
 

1411
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,470
that we have
available to us this is a pretty easy

1412
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
available to us this is a pretty easy
 

1413
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,350
available to us this is a pretty easy
question

1414
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,360
question
 

1415
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,830
question
uh what do we got just a quick question

1416
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
uh what do we got just a quick question
 

1417
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,909
uh what do we got just a quick question
yeah does the delete method also return

1418
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919
yeah does the delete method also return
 

1419
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,350
yeah does the delete method also return
whatever deletes

1420
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
whatever deletes
 

1421
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,990
whatever deletes
yes yes it does so in general if you

1422
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
yes yes it does so in general if you
 

1423
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,350
yes yes it does so in general if you
actually take a look at the session

1424
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
actually take a look at the session
 

1425
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,870
actually take a look at the session
notes it's giving you a nice little

1426
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:48,880
notes it's giving you a nice little
 

1427
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,590
notes it's giving you a nice little
reminder

1428
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:49,600
reminder
 

1429
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,430
reminder
recall the delete operations return the

1430
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
recall the delete operations return the
 

1431
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,710
recall the delete operations return the
deleted item

1432
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:52,720
deleted item
 

1433
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,950
deleted item
okay it says it right there on the thing

1434
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
okay it says it right there on the thing
 

1435
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,990
okay it says it right there on the thing
all right uh yeah

1436
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
all right uh yeah
 

1437
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,510
all right uh yeah
did you oh i i also had a question sure

1438
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,520
did you oh i i also had a question sure
 

1439
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,750
did you oh i i also had a question sure
and then this actually after you got it

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,230
one of the things that eric talked about
yesterday was generally in this class

1450
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,240
yesterday was generally in this class

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,470
yesterday was generally in this class
uh if you have it usually what we'll

1452
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
uh if you have it usually what we'll
 

1453
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,149
uh if you have it usually what we'll
give you is a running time bound on the

give you is a running time bound on the
things that you ask for

amount of time
but the amount of space that we are

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
but the amount of space that we are
 

1467
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,909

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,870
we'll
ask you to stay within a time bound and

1480
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
ask you to stay within a time bound and
 

1481
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,630
ask you to stay within a time bound and
not ask you to do something separate

1482
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
not ask you to do something separate

with space
 

1485
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,750
with space
but there are problems probably at the

1486
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,760
but there are problems probably at the
 

1487
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,789
but there are problems probably at the
end of this unit

1488
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:48,799
end of this unit
 

1489
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,630
end of this unit
where we might talk about space

1490
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
where we might talk about space
 

1491
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,230
where we might talk about space
complexity uh

1492
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
complexity uh
 

1493
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,549
complexity uh
but usually we will be we will be very

1494
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
but usually we will be we will be very
 

1495
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,590
but usually we will be we will be very
specific if we

1496
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,600
specific if we
 

1497
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,549
specific if we
if we want you to think about space any

1498
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
if we want you to think about space any
 

1499
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,909
if we want you to think about space any
other questions

1500
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
other questions
 

1501
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,990
other questions
all right so how do we implement this

1502
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
all right so how do we implement this
 

1503
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,950
all right so how do we implement this
swap ends thing

1504
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:02,960
swap ends thing
 

1505
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:10,070
swap ends thing
yeah this is a pretty easy one yeah

1506
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,080

 

1507
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,870

okay so another thing about this class

1508
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
okay so another thing about this class
 

1509
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,630
okay so another thing about this class
right

1510
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
right
 

1511
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,870
right
your your colleague over here is trying

1512
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:16,880
your your colleague over here is trying
 

1513
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,750
your your colleague over here is trying
to write

1514
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
to write
 

1515
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,350
to write
code to me okay uh

1516
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
code to me okay uh
 

1517
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,510
code to me okay uh
which is great for a computer and that's

which is great for a computer and that's
 

1519
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,590
which is great for a computer and that's
great if you're taking six level nine

1520
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
great if you're taking six level nine
 

1521
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,950
great if you're taking six level nine
it's not great if you're talking to your

it's not great if you're talking to your
 

1523
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,630
it's not great if you're talking to your
friends or if you're talking to me

right i am i can't parse code in my head
 

1527
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,149
right i am i can't parse code in my head
and compile it all the time

1528
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:34,159
and compile it all the time
 

1529
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,630
and compile it all the time
sometimes something i can but but not

1530
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
sometimes something i can but but not
 

1531
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,909
sometimes something i can but but not
all the time especially when it gets to

1532

all the time especially when it gets to
 

1533
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,870
all the time especially when it gets to
be a large program

1534
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
be a large program
 

1535
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,350

what it is the algorithm is doing okay

1542
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
what it is the algorithm is doing okay
 

1543
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,070
what it is the algorithm is doing okay
so

1544
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080
so
 

1545
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,750
so
can you start over with your description

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
can you start over with your description
 

1547
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,470
can you start over with your description
words are hard i agree with you okay

1548
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
words are hard i agree with you okay
 

1549
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,430
words are hard i agree with you okay

i would delete the last the last then

1552
00:30:59,830 --> 00:30:59,840
i would delete the last the last then
 

1553
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,830
i would delete the last the last then
okay

1554
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:02,840

 

1555
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,070

okay

1556
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
okay
 

1557
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,990
okay
okay so proposal we have a sequence of

1558
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
okay so proposal we have a sequence of
 

1559
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,029
okay so proposal we have a sequence of
things

1560
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,039
things
 

1561
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,149
things
uh again as eric was doing in lecture

1562
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
uh again as eric was doing in lecture
 

1563
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,630
uh again as eric was doing in lecture
yesterday uh this isn't representing an

1564
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
yesterday uh this isn't representing an
 

1565
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,230
yesterday uh this isn't representing an
array it's representing a sequence so

1566
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
array it's representing a sequence so
 

1567
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,750
array it's representing a sequence so
this is the

1568
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
this is the
 

1569
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,310
this is the
front first i guessed and last

1570
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
front first i guessed and last
 

1571
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,870
front first i guessed and last
and what your colleague was saying was

1572
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:24,880
and what your colleague was saying was
 

1573
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,110
and what your colleague was saying was
to delete this guy

1574
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
to delete this guy
 

1575
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,630
to delete this guy
yeah and stick it on the front

1576
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
yeah and stick it on the front
 

1577
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,750
yeah and stick it on the front
okay maybe by using delete last

1578
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
okay maybe by using delete last
 

1579
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,029
okay maybe by using delete last
and insert first okay

1580
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039
and insert first okay
 

1581
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,070
and insert first okay
that sounds pretty good does that do

1582
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
that sounds pretty good does that do
 

1583
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,149
that sounds pretty good does that do
what swap ends is doing swap ends

1584
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
what swap ends is doing swap ends
 

1585
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,830
what swap ends is doing swap ends
swap the first and last items in the

1586
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:44,840
swap the first and last items in the
 

1587
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,789
swap the first and last items in the
sequence

1588
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
sequence
 

1589
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,789
sequence
it's probably better to first store it

1590
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799
it's probably better to first store it
 

1591
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,950
it's probably better to first store it
in some other variables so that way we

1592
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
in some other variables so that way we
 

1593
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,350
in some other variables so that way we
can

1594
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
can
 

1595
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,310
can
get the delete the end so what your

1596
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
get the delete the end so what your
 

1597
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,350
get the delete the end so what your
colleague is saying

1598
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
colleague is saying
 

1599
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,669
colleague is saying
is well we've done kind of half of our

1600
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:57,679
is well we've done kind of half of our
 

1601
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,590
is well we've done kind of half of our
work

1602
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
work
 

1603
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,830
work
the first one's still over here right

1604
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
the first one's still over here right
 

1605
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,950
the first one's still over here right
that's no good

1606
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:02,960
that's no good
 

1607
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,789
that's no good
okay does someone have a way to modify

1608
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:04,799
okay does someone have a way to modify
 

1609
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,230
okay does someone have a way to modify
this

1610
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,240
this
 

1611
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,230
this
yeah before i modify the question in

1612
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
yeah before i modify the question in
 

1613
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,669
yeah before i modify the question in
order to modify

1614
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
order to modify
 

1615
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,830
order to modify
um restrictions about the amount of

1616
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
um restrictions about the amount of
 

1617
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,789
um restrictions about the amount of
things we're storing

1618
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:12,799
things we're storing
 

1619
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,110
things we're storing
ah yeah so how much extra space can we

1620
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
ah yeah so how much extra space can we
 

1621
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,389
ah yeah so how much extra space can we
use for example

1622
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
use for example
 

1623
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,269
use for example
right the easiest way would be to um

1624
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
right the easiest way would be to um
 

1625
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,950
right the easiest way would be to um
delete the labs that they prefer

1626
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
delete the labs that they prefer
 

1627
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,110
delete the labs that they prefer
and then just if we have them already

1628
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
and then just if we have them already
 

1629
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,070
and then just if we have them already
kept

1630
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
kept
 

1631
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,789
kept
them but i don't know if i can keep two

1632
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
them but i don't know if i can keep two
 

1633
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,830
them but i don't know if i can keep two
different bibles

1634
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:27,840
different bibles
 

1635
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,870
different bibles
good good question so the question right

1636
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:30,880
good good question so the question right
 

1637
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,590
good good question so the question right
can i

1638
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:31,600
can i
 

1639
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,149
can i
use additional space and in general if

1640
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:34,159
use additional space and in general if
 

1641
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,070
use additional space and in general if
we don't give you any restrictions

1642
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
we don't give you any restrictions
 

1643
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,430
we don't give you any restrictions
on what you can store then

1644
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440
on what you can store then
 

1645
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,590
on what you can store then
you can go wild do whatever you want

1646
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
you can go wild do whatever you want
 

1647
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,750
you can go wild do whatever you want
outside of this data structure right

1648
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:43,760
outside of this data structure right
 

1649
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,389
outside of this data structure right
like one of the things you could do is

1650
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:46,399
like one of the things you could do is
 

1651
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,549
like one of the things you could do is
you know

1652
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
you know
 

1653
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,269
you know
remove first on all of these things

1654
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:51,279
remove first on all of these things
 

1655
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,630
remove first on all of these things
right

1656
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,640
right
 

1657
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,110
right
store it in some data structure you like

1658
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
store it in some data structure you like
 

1659
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,190
store it in some data structure you like
manipulate it as much as you want

1660
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
manipulate it as much as you want
 

1661
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,590
manipulate it as much as you want
and then insert first i'm all the way

1662
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
and then insert first i'm all the way
 

1663
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,269
and then insert first i'm all the way
back in and rewrite the thing

1664
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,279
back in and rewrite the thing
 

1665
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,950
back in and rewrite the thing
but that's not going to give us constant

1666
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
but that's not going to give us constant
 

1667
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,870
but that's not going to give us constant
time which is what we're asking for

1668
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
time which is what we're asking for
 

1669
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,190
time which is what we're asking for
right but if we don't tell you otherwise

allowed to store a constant number of
 

1677
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,149
allowed to store a constant number of

things since we have constant time
 

1679
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,269
things since we have constant time
but generally uh unless we say no you

can't use additional space
you can use additional space okay so how

1684
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
you can use additional space okay so how
 

1685
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,350
you can use additional space okay so how
would you do that would

1686
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
would you do that would
 

1687
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:30,230
would you do that would
probably erase the last one

1688
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240

 

1689
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,830

that's great so what your colleague is

1690
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:31,840
that's great so what your colleague is
 

1691
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,470
that's great so what your colleague is
saying we delete both of them

1692
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,480
saying we delete both of them
 

1693
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,870
saying we delete both of them
we store them in temporary variables and

1694
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
we store them in temporary variables and
 

1695
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,070
we store them in temporary variables and
then one at a time

1696
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,080
then one at a time
 

1697
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,509
then one at a time
we insert each of them in their

1698
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:39,519
we insert each of them in their
 

1699
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,509
we insert each of them in their
corresponding place using the functions

1700
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
corresponding place using the functions
 

1701
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,789
corresponding place using the functions
that we have available okay

1702
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:42,799
that we have available okay
 

1703
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,310
that we have available okay
so if i were to write little pseudocode

1704
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,320
so if i were to write little pseudocode
 

1705
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,190
so if i were to write little pseudocode
for this um

1706
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
for this um
 

1707
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,269
for this um
i might take you know the first one

1708
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:51,279
i might take you know the first one
 

1709
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,750
i might take you know the first one
right i'd delete

1710
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:55,760
right i'd delete
 

1711
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,110
right i'd delete
uh first okay

1712
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
uh first okay
 

1713
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,230
uh first okay
i'm really abusing notation here

1714
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
i'm really abusing notation here
 

1715
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,389
i'm really abusing notation here
but that's okay you get what i'm saying

1716
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:04,399
but that's okay you get what i'm saying
 

1717
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,230
but that's okay you get what i'm saying
uh delete

1718
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,240

 

1719
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,230

the last and then store them

1720
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,240
the last and then store them
 

1721
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,669
the last and then store them
in their respective places insert

1722
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
in their respective places insert
 

1723
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,829
in their respective places insert
at the front which one i'm going to

1724
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:18,839
at the front which one i'm going to
 

1725
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,310
at the front which one i'm going to
insert

1726
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,320
insert
 

1727
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,950
insert
what's up hmm

1728
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:24,960
what's up hmm
 

1729
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,750
what's up hmm
speak up guys x2 yes thank you

1730
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
speak up guys x2 yes thank you
 

1731
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,750
speak up guys x2 yes thank you
and insert last

1732
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
and insert last
 

1733
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,109
and insert last
x1 right okay

1734
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119
x1 right okay
 

1735
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,750
x1 right okay
that's pretty easy yeah what would in

1736
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:39,760
that's pretty easy yeah what would in
 

1737
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,510
that's pretty easy yeah what would in
this case what would let her and

1738
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
this case what would let her and
 

1739
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,349
this case what would let her and
i think this might be relevant from like

1740
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:43,359
i think this might be relevant from like
 

1741
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,030
i think this might be relevant from like
what would constitute a pseudocode

1742
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
what would constitute a pseudocode
 

1743
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,629
what would constitute a pseudocode
versus

1744
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:46,639
versus
 

1745
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,430
versus
writing pythons all right so for this

1746
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:49,440
writing pythons all right so for this
 

1747
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,310
writing pythons all right so for this
this problem

1748
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,320
this problem
 

1749
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,069
this problem
you'll see the solutions posted to this

1750
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,079
you'll see the solutions posted to this
 

1751
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,990
you'll see the solutions posted to this
later on in that one

1752
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
later on in that one
 

1753
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,349
later on in that one
i wrote up a description of what i was

1754
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
i wrote up a description of what i was
 

1755
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,069
i wrote up a description of what i was
going to do

1756
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
going to do
 

1757
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,349
going to do
and then i actually because this was

1758
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
and then i actually because this was
 

1759
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,430
and then i actually because this was
pretty easy you know i actually wrote

1760
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,440
pretty easy you know i actually wrote
 

1761
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,270
pretty easy you know i actually wrote
down some python code to do

1762
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
down some python code to do
 

1763
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,510
down some python code to do
whatever whatever this thing was but in

1764
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,520
whatever whatever this thing was but in
 

1765
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,870
whatever whatever this thing was but in
general and

1766
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
general and
 

1767
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,150
general and
uh it's actually okay to write python or

1768
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,160
uh it's actually okay to write python or
 

1769
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,270
uh it's actually okay to write python or
pseudo code

1770
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
pseudo code
 

1771
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,390
pseudo code
of this form on your problem sets or on

1772
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
of this form on your problem sets or on
 

1773
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,430
of this form on your problem sets or on
an exam or something like that but

1774
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
an exam or something like that but
 

1775
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,190
an exam or something like that but
if we can't understand what your

1776
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
if we can't understand what your
 

1777
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,030
if we can't understand what your
variables mean if we can't understand

1778
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
variables mean if we can't understand
 

1779
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,069
variables mean if we can't understand
what your

1780
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:22,079
what your
 

1781
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,710
what your
pseudo code is doing then that's not

1782
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
pseudo code is doing then that's not
 

1783
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,510
pseudo code is doing then that's not
sufficient

1784
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,520
sufficient
 

1785
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,470
sufficient
right so the reason why we ask for words

1786
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,480
right so the reason why we ask for words
 

1787
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,190
right so the reason why we ask for words
is

1788
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
is
 

1789
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,750
is
so that you can communicate those ideas

1790
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
so that you can communicate those ideas
 

1791
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,470
so that you can communicate those ideas
well

1792
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
well
 

1793
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,150
well
okay so can you also have a combination

1794
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
okay so can you also have a combination
 

1795
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,150
okay so can you also have a combination
of pseudocode and description sure

1796
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
of pseudocode and description sure
 

1797
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,870
of pseudocode and description sure
yeah including both of them can be

1798
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
yeah including both of them can be
 

1799
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,630
yeah including both of them can be
clarifying for you

1800
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
clarifying for you
 

1801
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,710
clarifying for you
potentially yeah any other questions

1802
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720

 

1803
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,069

okay so now we have so one of this is

1804
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
okay so now we have so one of this is
 

1805
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,870
okay so now we have so one of this is
not such a

1806
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
not such a
 

1807
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,750
not such a
interesting question from an algorithm

1808
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:55,760
interesting question from an algorithm
 

1809
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,790
interesting question from an algorithm
standpoint right

1810
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:56,800
standpoint right
 

1811
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,270
standpoint right
this is a constant size problem kind of

1812
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
this is a constant size problem kind of
 

1813
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,069
this is a constant size problem kind of
right

1814
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:00,079
right
 

1815
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,870
right
i have this data structure i do two

1816
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
i have this data structure i do two
 

1817
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,510
i have this data structure i do two
operations i need to do something right

1818
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
operations i need to do something right
 

1819
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,069
operations i need to do something right
and this is so easy that i'm really not

1820
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:08,079
and this is so easy that i'm really not
 

1821
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,109
and this is so easy that i'm really not
even gonna argue

1822
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:09,119
even gonna argue
 

1823
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,109
even gonna argue
correctness i'm not even gonna have to

1824
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:11,119
correctness i'm not even gonna have to
 

1825
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,310
correctness i'm not even gonna have to
argue correctness

1826
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
argue correctness
 

1827
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,829
argue correctness
to you because we're essentially just

1828
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
to you because we're essentially just
 

1829
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,510
to you because we're essentially just
doing exactly what we asked for

1830
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
doing exactly what we asked for
 

1831
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,550
doing exactly what we asked for
right so you don't most of the time in

1832
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:18,560
right so you don't most of the time in
 

1833
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,750
right so you don't most of the time in
this class when you're doing something

1834
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
this class when you're doing something
 

1835
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,190
this class when you're doing something
non-trivial especially

1836
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200
non-trivial especially
 

1837
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,190
non-trivial especially
when you're doing something that has to

1838
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
when you're doing something that has to
 

1839
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,390
when you're doing something that has to
recurse in some way

1840
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:24,400
recurse in some way
 

1841
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,589
recurse in some way
we do want you to argue correctness okay

1842
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:27,599
we do want you to argue correctness okay
 

1843
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,550
we do want you to argue correctness okay
but in this case the for example the

1844
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:30,560
but in this case the for example the
 

1845
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,550
but in this case the for example the
time analysis is very easy right

1846
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:32,560
time analysis is very easy right
 

1847
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,710
time analysis is very easy right
we do four operations they each take

1848
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
we do four operations they each take
 

1849
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,670
we do four operations they each take
constant time

1850
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:35,680
constant time
 

1851
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,589
constant time
so this operation takes constant time

1852
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
so this operation takes constant time
 

1853
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,349
so this operation takes constant time
done yeah

1854
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:39,359
done yeah
 

1855
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,030
done yeah
all right so how about the second

1856
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
all right so how about the second
 

1857
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,630
all right so how about the second
operation

1858
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:42,640
operation
 

1859
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,710
operation
second operation at least uh

1860
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:46,720

 

1861
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,109

allows us to use a little bit more so

1862
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:49,119
allows us to use a little bit more so
 

1863
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,750
allows us to use a little bit more so
shift

1864
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:51,760

 

1865
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,790

left the

1866
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
left the
 

1867
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,910
left the
k this is

1868
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920
k this is
 

1869
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,990
k this is
the operation we're supporting now is

1870
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
the operation we're supporting now is
 

1871
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,589
the operation we're supporting now is
we're given this sequence and what we

1872
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
we're given this sequence and what we
 

1873
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,510
we're given this sequence and what we
want to do is take the

1874
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:03,520
want to do is take the
 

1875
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,430
want to do is take the
first k

1876
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:07,440

 

1877
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,710

right here

1878
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720

 

1879
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,670

and stick it over here at the back okay

1880
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:13,680
and stick it over here at the back okay
 

1881
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,630
and stick it over here at the back okay
so that

1882
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
so that
 

1883
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,910
so that
the uh these k go here so the

1884
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
the uh these k go here so the
 

1885
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,550
the uh these k go here so the
kth item ends up being the last item and

1886
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:20,560
kth item ends up being the last item and
 

1887
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:20,950
kth item ends up being the last item and
the k

1888
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
the k
 

1889
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,069
the k
plus one item now becomes the first item

1890
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:24,079
plus one item now becomes the first item
 

1891
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,349
plus one item now becomes the first item
does that make sense okay again this is

1892
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
does that make sense okay again this is
 

1893
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,950
does that make sense okay again this is
actually not such an interesting

1894
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:28,960
actually not such an interesting
 

1895
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,950
actually not such an interesting
algorithm from an algorithm standpoint

1896
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
algorithm from an algorithm standpoint
 

1897
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,990
algorithm from an algorithm standpoint
but it's hopefully uh

1898
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,000
but it's hopefully uh
 

1899
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,829
but it's hopefully uh
helpful to talk about from an

1900
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
helpful to talk about from an
 

1901
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,109
helpful to talk about from an
instructional point of view

1902
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:37,119
instructional point of view
 

1903
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,710
instructional point of view
okay so how would i approach this

1904
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:38,720
okay so how would i approach this
 

1905
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,550
okay so how would i approach this
problem i i need

1906
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
problem i i need
 

1907
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,589
problem i i need
this operation to

1908
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:43,599
this operation to
 

1909
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,270
this operation to
happen in order k time

1910
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
happen in order k time
 

1911
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,550
happen in order k time
yeah okay so first i'm go and delete

1912
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
yeah okay so first i'm go and delete
 

1913
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,990
yeah okay so first i'm go and delete
set a variable x1 to be the d dot delete

1914
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,000
set a variable x1 to be the d dot delete
 

1915
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,190
set a variable x1 to be the d dot delete
first element then a pet

1916
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,200
first element then a pet
 

1917
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,790
first element then a pet
do dot insert at the last exponent

1918
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:00,800
do dot insert at the last exponent
 

1919
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,710
do dot insert at the last exponent
d write a for loop and then do that k2

1920
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:02,720
d write a for loop and then do that k2
 

1921
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,550
d write a for loop and then do that k2
okay and i should have take two

1922
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
okay and i should have take two
 

1923
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,950
okay and i should have take two
steps which is okay okay so what your

1924
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
steps which is okay okay so what your
 

1925
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,990
steps which is okay okay so what your
colleague was saying

1926
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
colleague was saying
 

1927
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,109
colleague was saying
is uh that we're just going to delete

1928
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:11,119
is uh that we're just going to delete
 

1929
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,310
is uh that we're just going to delete
this guy

1930
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,320
this guy
 

1931
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,710
this guy
stick it on there do it k times

1932
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:16,720
stick it on there do it k times
 

1933
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,589
stick it on there do it k times
that sound good yeah so there's one of

1934
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
that sound good yeah so there's one of
 

1935
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,109
that sound good yeah so there's one of
the things in this class

1936
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:21,119
the things in this class
 

1937
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,670
the things in this class
that you have in terms of implementation

1938
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:23,680
that you have in terms of implementation
 

1939
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,230
that you have in terms of implementation
right

1940
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240
right
 

1941
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,510
right
usually there are two ways at least two

1942
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:27,520
usually there are two ways at least two
 

1943
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,950
usually there are two ways at least two
ways you could do something that

1944
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
ways you could do something that
 

1945
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,109
ways you could do something that
takes longer than constant time you

1946
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,119
takes longer than constant time you
 

1947
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,550
takes longer than constant time you
could write a for loop

1948
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,560
could write a for loop
 

1949
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,069
could write a for loop
or you could use recursion right

1950
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079
or you could use recursion right
 

1951
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,470
or you could use recursion right
and that's sometimes approaching a

1952
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:38,480
and that's sometimes approaching a
 

1953
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,349
and that's sometimes approaching a
problem

1954
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
problem
 

1955
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,950
problem
would be good one way rather than

1956
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
would be good one way rather than
 

1957
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,790
would be good one way rather than
another right

1958
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:42,800
another right
 

1959
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,190
another right
why is it that a lot of computer

1960
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,200
why is it that a lot of computer
 

1961
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,870
why is it that a lot of computer
scientists

1962
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
scientists
 

1963
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,349
scientists
as opposed to coding engineers prefer to

1964
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:49,359
as opposed to coding engineers prefer to
 

1965
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,030
as opposed to coding engineers prefer to
think about an algorithm recursively

1966
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
think about an algorithm recursively
 

1967
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,710
think about an algorithm recursively
does anyone know why

1968
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:52,720
does anyone know why
 

1969
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,430
does anyone know why
at least i do when i'm explaining it

1970
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
at least i do when i'm explaining it
 

1971
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,190
at least i do when i'm explaining it
from a theory standpoint

1972
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200
from a theory standpoint
 

1973
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,710
from a theory standpoint
it actually might not be good from an

1974
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:58,720
it actually might not be good from an
 

1975
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,790
it actually might not be good from an
implementation standpoint because your

1976
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
implementation standpoint because your
 

1977
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,870
implementation standpoint because your
computer can vectorize for loops and

1978
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:02,880
computer can vectorize for loops and
 

1979
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,470
computer can vectorize for loops and
things like but that's not something we

1980
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
things like but that's not something we
 

1981
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,910
things like but that's not something we
need to talk about

1982
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:05,920
need to talk about
 

1983
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,030
need to talk about
uh why would we want to talk about a

1984
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,040
uh why would we want to talk about a
 

1985
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,150
uh why would we want to talk about a
recursive algorithm

1986
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,160
recursive algorithm
 

1987
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,470
recursive algorithm
maybe more it lets you break up the

1988
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:12,480
maybe more it lets you break up the
 

1989
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,230
maybe more it lets you break up the
problem much smaller more manageable

1990
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
problem much smaller more manageable
 

1991
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,870
problem much smaller more manageable
pieces

1992
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
pieces
 

1993
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,670
pieces
okay so recursion uh lets you break up

1994
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:17,680
okay so recursion uh lets you break up
 

1995
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,270
okay so recursion uh lets you break up
the problem into small

1996
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,280
the problem into small
 

1997
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,510
the problem into small
measurable pieces that's that's actually

1998
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:21,520
measurable pieces that's that's actually
 

1999
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,310
measurable pieces that's that's actually
true

2000
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,320
true
 

2001
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,510
true
in in some context what your recursion

2002
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
in in some context what your recursion
 

2003
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,109
in in some context what your recursion
how i like to think about recursion a

2004
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:27,119
how i like to think about recursion a
 

2005
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,190
how i like to think about recursion a
lot of times is if i have a non-constant

2006
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,200
lot of times is if i have a non-constant
 

2007
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,670
lot of times is if i have a non-constant
amount of work that i have to do

2008
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:31,680
amount of work that i have to do
 

2009
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,230
amount of work that i have to do
usually easy for me it's hard for me to

2010
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
usually easy for me it's hard for me to
 

2011
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,710
usually easy for me it's hard for me to
hold

2012
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:34,720
hold
 

2013
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,390
hold
a non-constant amount of information in

00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:36,400
a non-constant amount of information in
 

2015
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,390
a non-constant amount of information in
my head right

2016
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,400
my head right
 

2017
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,589
my head right
what i want to do is think about a

2018
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
what i want to do is think about a
 

2019
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,910
what i want to do is think about a
constant amount of information at

2020
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:41,920
constant amount of information at
 

2021
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,990
constant amount of information at
at any given point in time because

2022
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
at any given point in time because
 

2023
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,750
at any given point in time because
that's easier for me to argue on

2024
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:45,760
that's easier for me to argue on
 

2025
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,430
that's easier for me to argue on
right it's easier for me to think about

2026
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
right it's easier for me to think about
 

2027
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,150
right it's easier for me to think about
making arguments case analysis on these

2028
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
making arguments case analysis on these
 

2029
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,990
making arguments case analysis on these
small amount of things

2030
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,000
small amount of things
 

2031
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,310
small amount of things
and so one of the things you can do is

2032
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
and so one of the things you can do is
 

2033
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,310
and so one of the things you can do is
if you break it down so that i

2034
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:58,320
if you break it down so that i
 

2035
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,750
if you break it down so that i
i solve a slightly smaller problem

2036
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:01,760
i solve a slightly smaller problem
 

2037
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,190
i solve a slightly smaller problem
recursively

2038
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200
recursively
 

2039
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,990
recursively
and then do a constant amount of work

2040
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,000
and then do a constant amount of work
 

2041
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,349
and then do a constant amount of work
and maintain

2042
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:07,359
and maintain
 

2043
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,470
and maintain
some invariant then it's very easy to

2044
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
some invariant then it's very easy to
 

2045
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,750
some invariant then it's very easy to
argue things about it

2046
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:11,760
argue things about it
 

2047
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,470
argue things about it
right it's very easy for me to convince

2048
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
right it's very easy for me to convince
 

2049
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,309
right it's very easy for me to convince
myself that this thing is correct

2050
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:16,319
myself that this thing is correct
 

2051
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,670
myself that this thing is correct
okay so i'm going to provide

2052
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
okay so i'm going to provide
 

2053
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,950
okay so i'm going to provide
a recursive way of solving this problem

2054
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
a recursive way of solving this problem
 

2055
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,750
a recursive way of solving this problem
can anyone set up maybe a recursive way

2056
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:25,760
can anyone set up maybe a recursive way
 

2057
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,109
can anyone set up maybe a recursive way
of thinking about this problem instead

2058
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:27,119
of thinking about this problem instead
 

2059
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,069
of thinking about this problem instead
of putting this

2060
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
of putting this
 

2061
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,510
of putting this
inside a for loop like your colleague

2062
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:29,520
inside a for loop like your colleague
 

2063
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:50,829
inside a for loop like your colleague
was saying

2064
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:50,839

 

2065
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:59,349

um

2066
00:40:59,349 --> 00:40:59,359

 

2067
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,750

ah so what your colleague is saying is

2068
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
ah so what your colleague is saying is
 

2069
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,710
ah so what your colleague is saying is
setting up the

2070
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:02,720
setting up the
 

2071
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,950
setting up the
a very nice thing right but she is

2072
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:04,960
a very nice thing right but she is
 

2073
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,550
a very nice thing right but she is
saying that if

2074
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
saying that if
 

2075
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,430
saying that if
we if we think about this recursively

2076
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440
we if we think about this recursively
 

2077
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,430
we if we think about this recursively
we'll think about a base case

2078
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
we'll think about a base case
 

2079
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,510
we'll think about a base case
which your colleague was saying maybe k

2080
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,520
which your colleague was saying maybe k
 

2081
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,950
which your colleague was saying maybe k
equals zero

2082
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:14,960
equals zero
 

2083
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,230
equals zero
right uh and otherwise

2084
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
right uh and otherwise
 

2085
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,710
right uh and otherwise
if we're not at zero what we'll do is

2086
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
if we're not at zero what we'll do is
 

2087
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,670
if we're not at zero what we'll do is
we'll

2088
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
we'll
 

2089
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,790
we'll
start it out right move one of these

2090
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:24,800
start it out right move one of these
 

2091
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,190
start it out right move one of these
guys over

2092
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,200
guys over
 

2093
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,349
guys over
and then we have an instance where we

2094
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
and then we have an instance where we
 

2095
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,030
and then we have an instance where we
want to shift

2096
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,040
want to shift
 

2097
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,550
want to shift
k minus one things over right

2098
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560
k minus one things over right
 

2099
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,710
k minus one things over right
it's we want to do the same thing but

2100
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:36,720
it's we want to do the same thing but
 

2101
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,870
it's we want to do the same thing but
with k minus 1 things

2102
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
with k minus 1 things
 

2103
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,349
with k minus 1 things
and so we can just call this thing for a

2104
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:41,359
and so we can just call this thing for a
 

2105
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,470
and so we can just call this thing for a
smaller value of k

2106
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,480
smaller value of k
 

2107
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,910
smaller value of k
does that make sense

2108
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920

 

2109
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,470

all right so let's try to write that out

2110
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
all right so let's try to write that out
 

2111
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,910
all right so let's try to write that out
um

2112
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920

 

2113
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,270

the first thing i'm going to write out

2114
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
the first thing i'm going to write out
 

2115
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,430
the first thing i'm going to write out
is kind of a a break

2116
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
is kind of a a break
 

2117
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,790
is kind of a a break
if if i'm at a base case

2118
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:00,800
if if i'm at a base case
 

2119
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,550
if if i'm at a base case
let's not do anything to this thing

2120
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,560
let's not do anything to this thing
 

2121
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,790
let's not do anything to this thing
right and maybe i also want some bounce

2122
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800
right and maybe i also want some bounce
 

2123
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,270
right and maybe i also want some bounce
checking

2124
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,280
checking
 

2125
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,390
checking
to make sure that we're in range okay so

2126
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
to make sure that we're in range okay so
 

2127
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,670
to make sure that we're in range okay so
i'm going to say

2128
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:09,680
i'm going to say
 

2129
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,670
i'm going to say
if you know our k is less than one

2130
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,680
if you know our k is less than one
 

2131
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,670
if you know our k is less than one
right we're certain i don't think we

2132
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
right we're certain i don't think we
 

2133
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,030
right we're certain i don't think we
should be doing anything to this array

2134
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,040
should be doing anything to this array
 

2135
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,069
should be doing anything to this array
so let's just

2136
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:18,079
so let's just
 

2137
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,750
so let's just
not do anything right if k is less than

2138
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:21,760
not do anything right if k is less than
 

2139
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,430
not do anything right if k is less than
one or

2140
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
one or
 

2141
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,750
one or
k is bigger than the length of d

2142
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
k is bigger than the length of d
 

2143
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,069
k is bigger than the length of d
minus one so i don't know what to do if

2144
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:34,079
minus one so i don't know what to do if
 

2145
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,910
minus one so i don't know what to do if
i'm you're asking me to shift more than

2146
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:35,920
i'm you're asking me to shift more than
 

2147
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,109
i'm you're asking me to shift more than
the things i have

2148
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:37,119
the things i have
 

2149
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,230
the things i have
right so let's not do that

2150
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,240
right so let's not do that
 

2151
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,150
right so let's not do that
uh is this uh

2152
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
uh is this uh
 

2153
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,870
uh is this uh
i guess it's really yeah because if it

2154
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
i guess it's really yeah because if it
 

2155
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,470
i guess it's really yeah because if it
was length of d

2156
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480
was length of d
 

2157
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,470
was length of d
right we would just not move anything

2158
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:50,480
right we would just not move anything
 

2159
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,750
right we would just not move anything
anyway right because we'd shift the

2160
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:51,760
anyway right because we'd shift the
 

2161
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,309
anyway right because we'd shift the
whole thing

2162
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:52,319
whole thing
 

2163
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,829
whole thing
right so we don't have to do anything

2164
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:53,839
right so we don't have to do anything
 

2165
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,190
right so we don't have to do anything
all right if we're in either of these

2166
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,200
all right if we're in either of these
 

2167
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,950
all right if we're in either of these
cases we're just going to return

2168
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:56,960
cases we're just going to return
 

2169
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,390
cases we're just going to return
because i either shouldn't do anything

2170
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
because i either shouldn't do anything
 

2171
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,829
because i either shouldn't do anything
to the array or i have no idea what

2172
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:01,839
to the array or i have no idea what
 

2173
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,870
to the array or i have no idea what
you're talking about

2174
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
you're talking about
 

2175
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,470
you're talking about
right if it's negative or something like

2176
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:04,480
right if it's negative or something like
 

2177
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,230
right if it's negative or something like
that okay

2178
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
that okay
 

2179
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,790
that okay
so that's the first thing otherwise what

2180
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
so that's the first thing otherwise what
 

2181
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,670
so that's the first thing otherwise what
do we do

2182
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:09,680
do we do
 

2183
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,270
do we do
we shift one thing over and then we make

2184
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
we shift one thing over and then we make
 

2185
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,990
we shift one thing over and then we make
a recursive call does that make sense

2186
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,000
a recursive call does that make sense
 

2187
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,790
a recursive call does that make sense
okay so

2188
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:20,800
okay so
 

2189
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,230
okay so
we'll delete the first thing as a

2190
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:24,240
we'll delete the first thing as a
 

2191
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,510
we'll delete the first thing as a
temporary variable

2192
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
temporary variable
 

2193
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,109
temporary variable
right delete first

2194
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119

 

2195
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,309

okay and then we'll

2196
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
okay and then we'll
 

2197
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,829
okay and then we'll
insert last

2198
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:38,839
insert last
 

2199
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,430
insert last
uh x

2200
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:41,440
uh x
 

2201
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,870
uh x
right

2202
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:44,880

 

2203
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,230

and then we need to do the recursive

2204
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240
and then we need to do the recursive
 

2205
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,589
and then we need to do the recursive
call so what's our recursive call look

2206
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:47,599
call so what's our recursive call look
 

2207
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,950
call so what's our recursive call look
like

2208
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
like
 

2209
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,829
like
yeah yeah

2210
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:52,839
yeah yeah
 

2211
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,630
yeah yeah
so shift

2212
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:56,640
so shift
 

2213
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,829
so shift
left d k

2214
00:43:59,829 --> 00:43:59,839
left d k
 

2215
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,430
left d k
minus one okay and then

2216
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
minus one okay and then
 

2217
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,510
minus one okay and then
we can return this this thing doesn't

2218
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
we can return this this thing doesn't
 

2219
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,109
we can return this this thing doesn't
need to return anything it's just doing

2220
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
need to return anything it's just doing
 

2221
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,230
need to return anything it's just doing
stuff to the thing

2222
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,240
stuff to the thing
 

2223
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,829
stuff to the thing
right and whenever we get

2224
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
right and whenever we get
 

2225
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,550
right and whenever we get
this k we make a call that gets down to

2226
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:14,560
this k we make a call that gets down to
 

2227
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,829
this k we make a call that gets down to
zero

2228
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
zero
 

2229
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,309
zero
we will terminate right because we will

2230
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:18,319
we will terminate right because we will
 

2231
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,109
we will terminate right because we will
return

2232
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
return
 

2233
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,030
return
right we're in this range somewhere

2234
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,040
right we're in this range somewhere
 

2235
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,190
right we're in this range somewhere
between we have an input

2236
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,200
between we have an input
 

2237
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,589
between we have an input
after this line we know that k is

2238
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:25,599
after this line we know that k is
 

2239
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,950
after this line we know that k is
somewhere between

2240
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
somewhere between
 

2241
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,710
somewhere between
1 and n minus 1 right and what we'll do

2242
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
1 and n minus 1 right and what we'll do
 

2243
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,950
1 and n minus 1 right and what we'll do
is every time through this recursion

2244
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
is every time through this recursion
 

2245
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,150
is every time through this recursion
we will subtract 1 from k

2246
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,160
we will subtract 1 from k
 

2247
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,390
we will subtract 1 from k
so this is a nice well-ordered sequence

2248
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
so this is a nice well-ordered sequence
 

2249
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,150
so this is a nice well-ordered sequence
right

2250
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,160
right
 

2251
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,030
right
we do the correct thing obviously right

2252
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:43,040
we do the correct thing obviously right
 

2253
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,109
we do the correct thing obviously right
in the base case

2254
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:45,119
in the base case
 

2255
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,510
in the base case
and as long as this thing was correct

2256
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
and as long as this thing was correct
 

2257
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,349
and as long as this thing was correct
for a smaller value of k

2258
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:49,359
for a smaller value of k
 

2259
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,750
for a smaller value of k
this thing also does the correct thing

2260
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
this thing also does the correct thing
 

2261
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,470
this thing also does the correct thing
right

2262
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
right
 

2263
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,550
right
because we're shifting over one as we

2264
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:54,560
because we're shifting over one as we
 

2265
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,670
because we're shifting over one as we
are asked

2266
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:55,680
are asked
 

2267
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,630
are asked
and we're letting this do the work of

2268
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,640
and we're letting this do the work of
 

2269
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,349
and we're letting this do the work of
the rest

2270
00:44:59,349 --> 00:44:59,359
the rest
 

2271
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,710
the rest
i don't have to think about that right

2272
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:00,720
i don't have to think about that right
 

2273
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,470
i don't have to think about that right
like i just have to think about this one

2274
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
like i just have to think about this one
 

2275
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,750
like i just have to think about this one
loop

2276
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
loop
 

2277
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,910
loop
this one part of the thing that i'm

2278
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
this one part of the thing that i'm
 

2279
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,829
this one part of the thing that i'm
doing constant amount of work is done in

2280
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:07,839
doing constant amount of work is done in

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:08,710
doing constant amount of work is done in
this section

2282
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:08,720
this section
 

2283
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,390
this section
and how many times do i call a function

2284
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
and how many times do i call a function
 

2285
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,750
and how many times do i call a function
okay yeah i think k minus one times or

2286
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:15,760
okay yeah i think k minus one times or
 

2287
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,589
okay yeah i think k minus one times or
i don't know i forget but it's order k

2288
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:17,599
i don't know i forget but it's order k
 

2289
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,790
i don't know i forget but it's order k
for sure right

2290
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:18,800
for sure right
 

2291
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,430
for sure right
and we do a constant amount of work per

2292
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
and we do a constant amount of work per
 

2293
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,069
and we do a constant amount of work per
call

2294
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:22,079
call
 

2295
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,710
call
ignoring this extra call does that make

2296
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
ignoring this extra call does that make
 

2297
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,430
ignoring this extra call does that make
sense

2298
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
sense
 

2299
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,510
sense
right so this thing runs in

2300
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
right so this thing runs in
 

2301
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,390
right so this thing runs in
order k as desired okay does that make

2302
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
order k as desired okay does that make
 

2303
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,670
order k as desired okay does that make
sense

2304
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
sense
 

2305
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,470
sense
all right so now we'll move on to

2306
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,480

 

2307
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,470

question three

2308
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:42,480

 

2309
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,990

does that any questions about question

2310
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,000
does that any questions about question
 

2311
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,630
does that any questions about question
two it's that one's really

2312
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:46,640
two it's that one's really
 

2313
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,990
two it's that one's really
probably one of the easiest problems

2314
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
probably one of the easiest problems
 

2315
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,349
probably one of the easiest problems
we've ever had on a problem

2316
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359

 

2317
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,630

sorry to uh scare you okay

2318
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:54,640
sorry to uh scare you okay
 

2319
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,790
sorry to uh scare you okay
so problem three okay so this is a

2320
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
so problem three okay so this is a
 

2321
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,349
so problem three okay so this is a
little block of text right here

2322
00:45:59,349 --> 00:45:59,359
little block of text right here
 

2323
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,349
little block of text right here
okay a dynamic array can support a

2324
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,359
okay a dynamic array can support a
 

2325
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,109
okay a dynamic array can support a
sequence interface supporting worst case

2326
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,119
sequence interface supporting worst case
 

2327
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,550
sequence interface supporting worst case
constant time indexing as well as

2328
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
constant time indexing as well as
 

2329
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,069
constant time indexing as well as
insertion and removal of items

2330
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:06,079
insertion and removal of items
 

2331
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,790
insertion and removal of items
at the back of the array in amortized

2332
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,800
at the back of the array in amortized
 

2333
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,230
at the back of the array in amortized
constant time so this is what we did

2334
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
constant time so this is what we did
 

2335
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,950
constant time so this is what we did
yesterday

2336
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:10,960
yesterday
 

2337
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,670
yesterday
in lecture right we showed how a dynamic

2338
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:13,680
in lecture right we showed how a dynamic
 

2339
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,550
in lecture right we showed how a dynamic
array

2340
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
array
 

2341
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,430
array
it's fast to do dynamic operations at

2342
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:17,440
it's fast to do dynamic operations at
 

2343
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,470
it's fast to do dynamic operations at
the end

2344
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,480
the end
 

2345
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,069
the end
right okay however insertion deletion at

2346
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:22,079
right okay however insertion deletion at
 

2347
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,150
right okay however insertion deletion at
the front is not very efficient because

2348
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
the front is not very efficient because
 

2349
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,510
the front is not very efficient because
if you tried to do that you'd have to

2350
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,520
if you tried to do that you'd have to
 

2351
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,349
if you tried to do that you'd have to
shift everything over right that makes

2352
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
shift everything over right that makes
 

2353
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,309
shift everything over right that makes
sense

2354
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
sense
 

2355
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,910
sense
all right on the other hand what we

2356
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920
all right on the other hand what we
 

2357
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,230
all right on the other hand what we
talked about yesterday was linked lists

2358
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
talked about yesterday was linked lists
 

2359
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,270
talked about yesterday was linked lists
uh they can be made to support insertion

2360
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,280
uh they can be made to support insertion
 

2361
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,710
uh they can be made to support insertion
and uh deletion at both ends in constant

2362
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720
and uh deletion at both ends in constant
 

2363
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,750
and uh deletion at both ends in constant
time okay so that's a little

2364
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
time okay so that's a little
 

2365
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,109
time okay so that's a little
foreshadowing of something you're going

2366
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,119
foreshadowing of something you're going
 

2367
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,870
foreshadowing of something you're going
to do on pset one

2368
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
to do on pset one
 

2369
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,230
to do on pset one
okay but in lecture we talked about

2370
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:46,240
okay but in lecture we talked about
 

2371
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,870
okay but in lecture we talked about
that operation that data structure a

2372
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:48,880
that operation that data structure a
 

2373
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,150
that operation that data structure a
singly linked list

2374
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
singly linked list
 

2375
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,550
singly linked list
being good at dynamic operations at the

2376
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:52,560
being good at dynamic operations at the
 

2377
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,150
being good at dynamic operations at the
front of the list right because

2378
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,160
front of the list right because
 

2379
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,990
front of the list right because
essentially we could just remember where

2380
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
essentially we could just remember where
 

2381
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,430
essentially we could just remember where
the front of the list was

2382
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:57,440
the front of the list was
 

2383
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,870
the front of the list was
and swap things in if as as needed right

2384
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:00,880
and swap things in if as as needed right
 

2385
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,790
and swap things in if as as needed right
that makes sense okay so on your problem

2386
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
that makes sense okay so on your problem
 

2387
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,870
that makes sense okay so on your problem
set what you're going to do is make

2388
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:04,880
set what you're going to do is make
 

2389
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,750
set what you're going to do is make
end operations good on the length list

2390
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:07,760
end operations good on the length list
 

2391
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,950
end operations good on the length list
as well

2392
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:08,960
as well
 

2393
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,589
as well
as well as supporting another operation

2394
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
as well as supporting another operation
 

2395
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,349
as well as supporting another operation
uh

2396
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:13,359
uh
 

2397
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,390
uh
but what's the problem with linked lists

2398
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
but what's the problem with linked lists
 

2399
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,910
but what's the problem with linked lists
uh as compared to dynamic

2400
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
uh as compared to dynamic
 

2401
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,109
uh as compared to dynamic
dynamic arrays yeah

2402
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:25,119

 

2403
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,349

yeah linked list lookups can take linear

2404
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
yeah linked list lookups can take linear
 

2405
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,390
yeah linked list lookups can take linear
time right because

2406
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:28,400
time right because
 

2407
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,390
time right because
i have no i don't have the benefit of an

2408
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,400
i have no i don't have the benefit of an
 

2409
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,670
i have no i don't have the benefit of an
array where i can

2410
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:31,680
array where i can
 

2411
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,309
array where i can
randomly access something in the middle

2412
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
randomly access something in the middle
 

2413
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,750
randomly access something in the middle
by essentially just

2414
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:35,760
by essentially just
 

2415
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,710
by essentially just
doing one arithmetic offset calculation

2416
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
doing one arithmetic offset calculation
 

2417
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,750
doing one arithmetic offset calculation
from the front

2418
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:39,760
from the front
 

2419
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,870
from the front
address right and being able to find

2420
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880
address right and being able to find
 

2421
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,030
address right and being able to find
this thing further down in constant time

2422
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,040
this thing further down in constant time
 

2423
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,990
this thing further down in constant time
using our

2424
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:46,000
using our
 

2425
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,069
using our
com model of computation of the random

2426
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:48,079
com model of computation of the random
 

2427
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,589
com model of computation of the random
access machine right

2428
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
access machine right
 

2429
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,349
access machine right
you know linked lists these things could

2430
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:51,359
you know linked lists these things could
 

2431
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,109
you know linked lists these things could
be stored all over the place in memory

2432
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:53,119
be stored all over the place in memory
 

2433
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,069
be stored all over the place in memory
and i have to

2434
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:54,079
and i have to
 

2435
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,030
and i have to
kind of traverse those pointers until i

2436
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
kind of traverse those pointers until i
 

2437
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,549
kind of traverse those pointers until i
get to the one that i'm looking for

2438
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
get to the one that i'm looking for
 

2439
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,750
get to the one that i'm looking for
right that's that's a benefit of an

2440
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760
right that's that's a benefit of an
 

2441
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,630
right that's that's a benefit of an
array-based

2442
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
array-based
 

2443
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,270
array-based
data structure versus a a link to a

2444
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:05,280
data structure versus a a link to a
 

2445
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,309
data structure versus a a link to a
pointer-based one

2446
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:06,319
pointer-based one
 

2447
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,589
pointer-based one
right okay so the then we get to the

2448
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:09,599
right okay so the then we get to the
 

2449
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,190
right okay so the then we get to the
meat of this question

2450
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
meat of this question
 

2451
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,710
meat of this question
show that we can have the best of both

2452
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
show that we can have the best of both
 

2453
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,270
show that we can have the best of both
worlds right we can have a

2454
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,280
worlds right we can have a
 

2455
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,950
worlds right we can have a
data structure that supports um

2456
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
data structure that supports um
 

2457
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,470
data structure that supports um
worst case constant time lookup just

2458
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,480
worst case constant time lookup just
 

2459
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,230
worst case constant time lookup just
like an array

2460
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:22,240
like an array
 

2461
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,670
like an array
but amortize constant time dynamic

2462
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
but amortize constant time dynamic
 

2463
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,870
but amortize constant time dynamic
operations

2464
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
operations
 

2465
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,069
operations
from the back and the front

2466
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
from the back and the front
 

2467
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,109
from the back and the front
of the sequence does that make sense

2468
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:33,119
of the sequence does that make sense
 

2469
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,750
of the sequence does that make sense
all right so is this question or if okay

2470
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:37,760
all right so is this question or if okay
 

2471
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,790
all right so is this question or if okay
yes can i define sorry about that can i

2472
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:40,800
yes can i define sorry about that can i
 

2473
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,190
yes can i define sorry about that can i
define

2474
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:41,200
define
 

2475
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,750
define
amortize one more time okay so this is

2476
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:43,760
amortize one more time okay so this is
 

2477
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,829
amortize one more time okay so this is
this is a tough

2478
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:45,839
this is a tough
 

2479
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,150
this is a tough
thing to define in general but and uh

2480
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
thing to define in general but and uh
 

2481
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,430
thing to define in general but and uh
but not that much right so all right so

2482
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:53,440
but not that much right so all right so
 

2483
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,790
but not that much right so all right so
amortization usually you put in the

2484
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
amortization usually you put in the
 

2485
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,990
amortization usually you put in the
at least in this class we're going to

2486
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,000
at least in this class we're going to
 

2487
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,990
at least in this class we're going to
put in in terms of the data structure

2488
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000
put in in terms of the data structure
 

2489
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,069
put in in terms of the data structure
okay so you have this thing right it

2490
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:02,079
okay so you have this thing right it
 

2491
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,430
okay so you have this thing right it
supports some operations

2492
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,440
supports some operations
 

2493
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,630
supports some operations
and you're going to do a bunch of

2494
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,640
and you're going to do a bunch of
 

2495
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,710
and you're going to do a bunch of
operations on that thing right

2496
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:06,720
operations on that thing right
 

2497
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,230
operations on that thing right
there's not really a reason to have a

2498
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:08,240
there's not really a reason to have a
 

2499
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,910
there's not really a reason to have a
data structure unless you're going to do

2500
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:09,920
data structure unless you're going to do
 

2501
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,349
data structure unless you're going to do
lots of things to it

2502
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:11,359
lots of things to it
 

2503
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,750
lots of things to it
right otherwise you just write a single

2504
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
right otherwise you just write a single
 

2505
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,589
right otherwise you just write a single
algorithm to do whatever it is that you

2506
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:15,599
algorithm to do whatever it is that you
 

2507
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,630
algorithm to do whatever it is that you
want to do

2508
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
want to do
 

2509
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,349
want to do
right so data structure the the value of

2510
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:19,359
right so data structure the the value of
 

2511
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,470
right so data structure the the value of
the data structure

2512
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:20,480
the data structure
 

2513
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,510
the data structure
is that you can do some work up front

2514
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:23,520
is that you can do some work up front
 

2515
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,150
is that you can do some work up front
by making this thing to make some of

2516
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
by making this thing to make some of
 

2517
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,990
by making this thing to make some of
these operations faster

2518
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000
these operations faster
 

2519
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,349
these operations faster
okay so what amortization means

2520
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
okay so what amortization means
 

2521
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,390
okay so what amortization means
is okay if i have say a dynamic array

2522
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,400
is okay if i have say a dynamic array
 

2523
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,069
is okay if i have say a dynamic array
where i'm going to be inserting things

2524
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:38,079
where i'm going to be inserting things
 

2525
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,510
where i'm going to be inserting things
at the end

2526
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
at the end
 

2527
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,710
at the end
right yes sometimes when i add something

2528
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:44,720
right yes sometimes when i add something
 

2529
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,470
right yes sometimes when i add something
i'm going to spend a lot of time to add

2530
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
i'm going to spend a lot of time to add
 

2531
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,069
i'm going to spend a lot of time to add
that thing i'm going to spend linear

2532
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:48,079
that thing i'm going to spend linear
 

2533
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:48,549
that thing i'm going to spend linear
time

2534
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:48,559
time
 

2535
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,750
time
right but what's the point of this

2536
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760
right but what's the point of this
 

2537
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,190
right but what's the point of this
data structure in the first place the

2538
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,200
data structure in the first place the
 

2539
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,750
data structure in the first place the
point is that i want to be able to

2540
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:55,760
point is that i want to be able to
 

2541
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,430
point is that i want to be able to
potentially add a lot of things to this

2542
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,440
potentially add a lot of things to this
 

2543
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,190
potentially add a lot of things to this
thing does that make sense

2544
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200
thing does that make sense
 

2545
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,990
thing does that make sense
right amortization is saying that even

2546
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,000
right amortization is saying that even
 

2547
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,309
right amortization is saying that even
though

2548
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
though
 

2549
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,589
though
sometimes this operation will be bad

2550
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:05,599
sometimes this operation will be bad
 

2551
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,030
sometimes this operation will be bad
right averaged over many operations this

2552
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,040
right averaged over many operations this
 

2553
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,589
right averaged over many operations this
is going to

2554
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:09,599
is going to
 

2555
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,870
is going to
have a better running time that's the

2556
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:10,880
have a better running time that's the
 

2557
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,950
have a better running time that's the
amortization so more formally

2558
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
amortization so more formally
 

2559
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,630
amortization so more formally
right what's that's going to say is if i

2560
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:14,640
right what's that's going to say is if i
 

2561
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,150
right what's that's going to say is if i
have an operation

2562
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,160
have an operation
 

2563
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,030
have an operation
the definition of it running in amortize

2564
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,040
the definition of it running in amortize
 

2565
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,069
the definition of it running in amortize
some amount of time

2566
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
some amount of time
 

2567
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,670
some amount of time
say k time or

2568
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,680
say k time or
 

2569
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,309
say k time or
yeah sure that means that if i do

2570
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
yeah sure that means that if i do
 

2571
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,870
yeah sure that means that if i do
n operations kind of generally for large

2572
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
n operations kind of generally for large
 

2573
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,790
n operations kind of generally for large
n right

2574
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:32,800
n right
 

2575
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,589
n right
if i do that operation n times the total

2576
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:35,599
if i do that operation n times the total
 

2577
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,109
if i do that operation n times the total
time it takes me

2578
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:37,119
time it takes me
 

2579
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,270
time it takes me
to do all of those operations is not

2580
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
to do all of those operations is not
 

2581
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,109
to do all of those operations is not
going to be more than n times k

2582
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:41,119
going to be more than n times k
 

2583
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,630
going to be more than n times k
right so on average it's going to take

2584
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
right so on average it's going to take
 

2585
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,230
right so on average it's going to take
me k time okay

2586
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
me k time okay
 

2587
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,270
me k time okay
now in o46 you'll get a more formal

2588
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,280
now in o46 you'll get a more formal
 

2589
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,549
now in o46 you'll get a more formal
definition of that and you'll

2590
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:48,559
definition of that and you'll
 

2591
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,470
definition of that and you'll
get a lot of ways of analyzing things

2592
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:52,480
get a lot of ways of analyzing things
 

2593
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,309
get a lot of ways of analyzing things
like a potential function

2594
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:54,319
like a potential function
 

2595
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,030
like a potential function
and we're going to use some what we call

2596
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
and we're going to use some what we call
 

2597
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,549
and we're going to use some what we call
charging arguments even

2598
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:58,559
charging arguments even
 

2599
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,829
charging arguments even
even today um but it so it's a much

2600
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:01,839
even today um but it so it's a much
 

2601
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:02,870
even today um but it so it's a much
broader

2602
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
broader
 

2603
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,150
broader
uh uh analysis paradigm than what we're

2604
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:06,160
uh uh analysis paradigm than what we're
 

2605
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,270
uh uh analysis paradigm than what we're
going to talk about we're only going to

2606
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:07,280
going to talk about we're only going to
 

2607
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,549
going to talk about we're only going to
talk about it for this

2608
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:08,559
talk about it for this
 

2609
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,870
talk about it for this
this material with dynamic arrays and

2610
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880
this material with dynamic arrays and
 

2611
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,230
this material with dynamic arrays and
we'll just kind of

2612
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,240
we'll just kind of
 

2613
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,910
we'll just kind of
it's just kind of an introduction to

2614
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:13,920
it's just kind of an introduction to
 

2615
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,670
it's just kind of an introduction to
that concept but does that make sense

2616
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:15,680
that concept but does that make sense
 

2617
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,190
that concept but does that make sense
amortized as a financial term right

2618
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
amortized as a financial term right
 

2619
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,430
amortized as a financial term right
if you know from financial term it kind

2620
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:21,440
if you know from financial term it kind
 

2621
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,230
if you know from financial term it kind
of means

2622
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,240
of means
 

2623
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,510
of means
over the long term this is what it is on

2624
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
over the long term this is what it is on
 

2625
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,950
over the long term this is what it is on
average right you can think about that

2626
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:26,960
average right you can think about that
 

2627
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,950
average right you can think about that
but that's different than running time

2628
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
but that's different than running time
 

2629
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,069
but that's different than running time
that's

2630
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
that's
 

2631
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,630
that's
average running time of an algorithm

2632
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:32,640
average running time of an algorithm
 

2633
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,270
average running time of an algorithm
right

2634
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
right
 

2635
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,190
right
it's it's a much different concept right

2636
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
it's it's a much different concept right
 

2637
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,630
it's it's a much different concept right
what do what is an average

2638
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
what do what is an average
 

2639
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,950
what do what is an average
running time well that that's that's

2640
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:38,960
running time well that that's that's
 

2641
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,549
running time well that that's that's
hard to define because it's talking

2642
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:40,559
hard to define because it's talking
 

2643
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,109
hard to define because it's talking
about

2644
00:51:41,109 --> 00:51:41,119
about
 

2645
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,510
about
an average over all possible inputs and

2646
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:43,520
an average over all possible inputs and
 

2647
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,470
an average over all possible inputs and
then okay

2648
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:44,480
then okay
 

2649
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,230
then okay
maybe some inputs are more likely than

2650
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:46,240
maybe some inputs are more likely than
 

2651
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,150
maybe some inputs are more likely than
others right and so you've got a

2652
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
others right and so you've got a
 

2653
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,670
others right and so you've got a
distribution on the inputs and you're

2654
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:49,680
distribution on the inputs and you're
 

2655
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,430
distribution on the inputs and you're
trying to average the running time

2656
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
trying to average the running time
 

2657
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,829
trying to average the running time
that's a much that this has nothing to

2658
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
that's a much that this has nothing to
 

2659
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:54,470
that's a much that this has nothing to
do with that

2660
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:54,480
do with that
 

2661
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,270
do with that
right amortization means that you have a

2662
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,280
right amortization means that you have a
 

2663
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,870
right amortization means that you have a
usually a data structure

2664
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
usually a data structure
 

2665
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,950
usually a data structure
that you're operating on and you're

2666
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
that you're operating on and you're
 

2667
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,950
that you're operating on and you're
doing an operation multiple times

2668
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:02,960
doing an operation multiple times
 

2669
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,790
doing an operation multiple times
and you're getting a benefit because

2670
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
and you're getting a benefit because
 

2671
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,150
and you're getting a benefit because
you're doing that operation lots of

2672
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,160
you're doing that operation lots of
 

2673
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,710
you're doing that operation lots of
times

2674
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:06,720
times
 

2675
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,670
times
okay and so when you are instantiating a

2676
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:09,680
okay and so when you are instantiating a
 

2677
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,030
okay and so when you are instantiating a
python list

2678
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,040
python list
 

2679
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,430
python list
and you're doing push and pop operations

2680
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:13,440
and you're doing push and pop operations
 

2681
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,630
and you're doing push and pop operations
on the back

2682
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
on the back
 

2683
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,990
on the back
right that's or is it append a

2684
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:18,000
right that's or is it append a
 

2685
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,950
right that's or is it append a
pendant and pop okay i'm i've been

2686
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
pendant and pop okay i'm i've been
 

2687
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,190
pendant and pop okay i'm i've been
writing javascript a little bit recently

2688
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
writing javascript a little bit recently
 

2689
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,270
writing javascript a little bit recently
um but so append and pop

2690
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,280
um but so append and pop
 

2691
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,549
um but so append and pop
right those those operations while not

2692
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
right those those operations while not
 

2693
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,990
right those those operations while not
cheap all the time are cheap well enough

2694
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,000
cheap all the time are cheap well enough
 

2695
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,589
cheap all the time are cheap well enough
that when we analyze

2696
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:35,599
that when we analyze
 

2697
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,829
that when we analyze
an entire algorithm that might do a

2698
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:37,839
an entire algorithm that might do a
 

2699
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,670
an entire algorithm that might do a
linear number of

2700
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:39,680
linear number of
 

2701
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,549
linear number of
uh appends to this list right all of

2702
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:42,559
uh appends to this list right all of
 

2703
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,309
uh appends to this list right all of
those pens added together

2704
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:44,319
those pens added together
 

2705
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,230
those pens added together
will only take linear time because i've

2706
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
will only take linear time because i've
 

2707
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,510
will only take linear time because i've
done a linear number of them does that

2708
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:47,520
done a linear number of them does that
 

2709
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,109
done a linear number of them does that
make sense

2710
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:49,119
make sense
 

2711
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,990
make sense
okay long-winded uh answer to your

2712
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,000
okay long-winded uh answer to your
 

2713
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,829
okay long-winded uh answer to your
question sorry about that

2714
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:53,839
question sorry about that
 

2715
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,390
question sorry about that
uh any other questions before we get

2716
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
uh any other questions before we get
 

2717
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,589
uh any other questions before we get
going

2718
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
going
 

2719
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,069
going
all right so how can anyone have any

2720
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
all right so how can anyone have any
 

2721
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,150
all right so how can anyone have any
ideas of how we can

2722
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:02,160
ideas of how we can
 

2723
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,190
ideas of how we can
use the ideas of a dynamic array and

2724
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,200
use the ideas of a dynamic array and
 

2725
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,069
use the ideas of a dynamic array and
make it good

2726
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:06,079
make it good
 

2727
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,349
make it good
for operations on both ends i'll let

2728
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:09,359
for operations on both ends i'll let
 

2729
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,790
for operations on both ends i'll let
someone else

2730
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:10,800
someone else
 

2731
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,430
someone else
answer i'll give give a second and then

2732
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:13,440
answer i'll give give a second and then
 

2733
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:20,630
answer i'll give give a second and then
go to you in a second yeah

2734
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640

 

2735
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,309

sure

2736
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:24,319

 

2737
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,430

that's that's an excellent idea is one

2738
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:27,440
that's that's an excellent idea is one
 

2739
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,309
that's that's an excellent idea is one
of the ways we're going to

2740
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
of the ways we're going to
 

2741
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,510
of the ways we're going to
we're going to talk about two ways of

2742
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:29,520
we're going to talk about two ways of
 

2743
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,430
we're going to talk about two ways of
doing this um

2744
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,440
doing this um
 

2745
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,270
doing this um
right so what your colleague was saying

2746
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:33,280
right so what your colleague was saying
 

2747
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,030
right so what your colleague was saying
was that in lecture when we were talking

2748
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
was that in lecture when we were talking
 

2749
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,630
was that in lecture when we were talking
about dynamical ways and we wanted to

2750
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
about dynamical ways and we wanted to
 

2751
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,589
about dynamical ways and we wanted to
make

2752
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:37,599
make
 

2753
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,750
make
operations on the kind of the right side

2754
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:39,760
operations on the kind of the right side
 

2755
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,950
operations on the kind of the right side
the end

2756
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:40,960
the end
 

2757
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,630
the end
uh fast right what we did was we

2758
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,640
uh fast right what we did was we
 

2759
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,870
uh fast right what we did was we
allocated some extra space at the end

2760
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:46,880
allocated some extra space at the end
 

2761
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,829
allocated some extra space at the end
and then when we

2762
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:47,839
and then when we
 

2763
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,670
and then when we
added things right we didn't have to

2764
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,680
added things right we didn't have to
 

2765
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,430
added things right we didn't have to
reallocate we had space to put those

2766
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:51,440
reallocate we had space to put those
 

2767
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,549
reallocate we had space to put those
things right

2768
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
things right
 

2769
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,190
things right
so what your uh what your colleague was

2770
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,200
so what your uh what your colleague was
 

2771
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,710
so what your uh what your colleague was
saying was let's just do the same thing

2772
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:56,720
saying was let's just do the same thing
 

2773
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,069
saying was let's just do the same thing
on both ends

2774
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:58,079
on both ends
 

2775
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,309
on both ends
okay let's leave some extra space on the

2776
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:00,319
okay let's leave some extra space on the
 

2777
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,190
okay let's leave some extra space on the
front and

2778
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,200
front and
 

2779
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,030
front and
extra space on the back when we

2780
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
extra space on the back when we
 

2781
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,470
extra space on the back when we
instantiate this thing

2782
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:04,480
instantiate this thing
 

2783
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,510
instantiate this thing
and then we can rebuild less

2784
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520
and then we can rebuild less
 

2785
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,390
and then we can rebuild less
frequently than if we didn't have that

2786
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:10,400
frequently than if we didn't have that
 

2787
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,069
frequently than if we didn't have that
extra space does that make sense

2788
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:12,079
extra space does that make sense
 

2789
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,069
extra space does that make sense
okay so what we had for

2790
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
okay so what we had for
 

2791
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,630
okay so what we had for
let's stay down here so this is question

2792
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,640
let's stay down here so this is question
 

2793
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,349
let's stay down here so this is question
three

2794
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:19,359
three
 

2795
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,150
three
right the idea of the dynamic array

2796
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,160
right the idea of the dynamic array
 

2797
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,109
right the idea of the dynamic array
right was that we kind of

2798
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
right was that we kind of
 

2799
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,190
right was that we kind of
left some extra space here at the end

2800
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200
left some extra space here at the end
 

2801
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,309
left some extra space here at the end
right so that uh sure we allocated more

2802
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
right so that uh sure we allocated more
 

2803
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,670
right so that uh sure we allocated more
than we needed to

2804
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
than we needed to
 

2805
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,349
than we needed to
right but when we insert things now

2806
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
right but when we insert things now
 

2807
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,630
right but when we insert things now
it's cheap and we don't have to

2808
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
it's cheap and we don't have to
 

2809
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,870
it's cheap and we don't have to
allocate more space for this thing until

2810
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:42,880
allocate more space for this thing until
 

2811
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,430
allocate more space for this thing until
we've done a linear number of insertions

2812
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,440
we've done a linear number of insertions
 

2813
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:45,990
we've done a linear number of insertions
right

2814
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
right
 

2815
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,030
right
this was and this was n really any

2816
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:49,040
this was and this was n really any
 

2817
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,030
this was and this was n really any
constant factor we'll do here

2818
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,040
constant factor we'll do here
 

2819
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,870
constant factor we'll do here
but if you had n things here we'd be

2820
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880
but if you had n things here we'd be
 

2821
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,589
but if you had n things here we'd be
assured that i wouldn't need to rebuild

2822
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
assured that i wouldn't need to rebuild
 

2823
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,710
assured that i wouldn't need to rebuild
this thing until i've done a linear

2824
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:58,720
this thing until i've done a linear
 

2825
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,470
this thing until i've done a linear
number of operations and so

2826
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:00,480
number of operations and so
 

2827
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,230
number of operations and so
in a sense i can charge the linear time

2828
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
in a sense i can charge the linear time
 

2829
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,069
in a sense i can charge the linear time
operation of re-expanding this

2830
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:06,079
operation of re-expanding this
 

2831
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,950
operation of re-expanding this
thing to each one of those operations

2832
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:08,960
thing to each one of those operations
 

2833
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,150
thing to each one of those operations
and so on average

2834
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
and so on average
 

2835
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,230
and so on average
it'll be constant does that make sense

2836
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
it'll be constant does that make sense
 

2837
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,190
it'll be constant does that make sense
right so

2838
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,200
right so
 

2839
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,309
right so
instead what your colleague was saying

2840
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:16,319
instead what your colleague was saying
 

2841
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,710
instead what your colleague was saying
let's instantiate this thing with some

2842
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
let's instantiate this thing with some
 

2843
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,829
let's instantiate this thing with some
extra space on both sides

2844
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
extra space on both sides
 

2845
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,589
extra space on both sides
okay so now as i insert thing here

2846
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:25,599
okay so now as i insert thing here
 

2847
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,390
okay so now as i insert thing here
insert thing here blah blah blah blah

2848
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:28,400
insert thing here blah blah blah blah
 

2849
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,549
insert thing here blah blah blah blah
i'll definitely know that after a linear

2850
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:30,559
i'll definitely know that after a linear
 

2851
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,309
i'll definitely know that after a linear
number of insertions

2852
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
number of insertions
 

2853
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,230
number of insertions
when i rebuild this thing i'll have done

2854
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,240
when i rebuild this thing i'll have done
 

2855
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,829
when i rebuild this thing i'll have done
enough operations to pay

2856
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:35,839
enough operations to pay
 

2857
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,589
enough operations to pay
for that expensive operation does that

2858
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:37,599
for that expensive operation does that
 

2859
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,630
for that expensive operation does that
make sense so that's the idea behind

2860
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
make sense so that's the idea behind
 

2861
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,069
make sense so that's the idea behind
you know expanding this dynamic array to

2862
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:44,079
you know expanding this dynamic array to
 

2863
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:44,630
you know expanding this dynamic array to
be

2864
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
be
 

2865
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,589
be
kind of this dynamic deck right so it

2866
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
kind of this dynamic deck right so it
 

2867
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,390
kind of this dynamic deck right so it
does

2868
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:48,400
does
 

2869
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,950
does
it's a doubly ended queue kind of system

2870
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:50,960
it's a doubly ended queue kind of system
 

2871
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,150
it's a doubly ended queue kind of system
where i can

2872
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
where i can
 

2873
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,670
where i can
do dynamic operations efficiently on

2874
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:55,680
do dynamic operations efficiently on
 

2875
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,549
do dynamic operations efficiently on
both ends

2876
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
both ends
 

2877
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,230
both ends
okay so one of the things that we talked

2878
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
okay so one of the things that we talked
 

2879
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,390
okay so one of the things that we talked
about

2880
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:00,400
about
 

2881
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,349
about
uh yesterday was also removing right at

2882
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:03,359
uh yesterday was also removing right at
 

2883
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:03,990
uh yesterday was also removing right at
the end

2884
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
the end
 

2885
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,190
the end
right removing

2886
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
right removing
 

2887
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,430
right removing
uh items from the back of this thing

2888
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:11,440
uh items from the back of this thing
 

2889
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,950
uh items from the back of this thing
will decrease the number of items we're

2890
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
will decrease the number of items we're
 

2891
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,190
will decrease the number of items we're
storing right that makes sense

2892
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
storing right that makes sense
 

2893
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,510
storing right that makes sense
and maybe we're just fine with that

2894
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:19,520
and maybe we're just fine with that
 

2895
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,390
and maybe we're just fine with that
right but what's

2896
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,400
right but what's
 

2897
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,430
right but what's
what's a problem what what's as a

2898
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:23,440
what's a problem what what's as a
 

2899
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,349
what's a problem what what's as a
programmer

2900
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
programmer
 

2901
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,549
programmer
why might you not like just removing

2902
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:28,559
why might you not like just removing
 

2903
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,109
why might you not like just removing
items

2904
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:29,119
items
 

2905
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,270
items
until you got to nothing and just

2906
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
until you got to nothing and just
 

2907
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,950
until you got to nothing and just
leaving the space where it is

2908
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
leaving the space where it is
 

2909
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,510
leaving the space where it is
yeah it might lock up a lot of memory

2910
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:35,520
yeah it might lock up a lot of memory
 

2911
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,230
yeah it might lock up a lot of memory
yeah so

2912
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:36,240
yeah so
 

2913
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,470
yeah so
let's say over the course of my program

2914
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,480
let's say over the course of my program
 

2915
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,990
let's say over the course of my program
i use this data structure

2916
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:40,000
i use this data structure
 

2917
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,750
i use this data structure
right i'm just trying to fill it up with

2918
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:41,760
right i'm just trying to fill it up with
 

2919
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,190
right i'm just trying to fill it up with
stuff

2920
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
stuff
 

2921
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,750
stuff
and then i remove all but like two

2922
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
and then i remove all but like two
 

2923
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,950
and then i remove all but like two
things

2924
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:46,960
things
 

2925
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,870
things
right and then i go about my business i

2926
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:48,880
right and then i go about my business i
 

2927
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,549
right and then i go about my business i
run through the program right but i'm

2928
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:50,559
run through the program right but i'm
 

2929
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,710
run through the program right but i'm
i'm never really using all any but those

2930
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
i'm never really using all any but those
 

2931
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,230
i'm never really using all any but those
two things for the rest of my program

2932
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:56,240
two things for the rest of my program
 

2933
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,230
two things for the rest of my program
but now i've got i don't know maybe i

2934
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:58,240
but now i've got i don't know maybe i
 

2935
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,470
but now i've got i don't know maybe i
did put a thousand or a million or a

2936
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,480
did put a thousand or a million or a
 

2937
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,910
did put a thousand or a million or a
billion things in that

2938
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
billion things in that
 

2939
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,430
billion things in that
thing and then when i as i decreased

2940
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
thing and then when i as i decreased
 

2941
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,150
thing and then when i as i decreased
uh as i removed things from that item i

2942
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160
uh as i removed things from that item i
 

2943
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,910
uh as i removed things from that item i
still have all that space there

2944
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:09,920
still have all that space there
 

2945
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,630
still have all that space there
being taken up by essentially is nothing

2946
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
being taken up by essentially is nothing
 

2947
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,109
being taken up by essentially is nothing
right

2948
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:13,119
right
 

2949
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,510
right
because i've removed everything from it

2950
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:15,520
because i've removed everything from it
 

2951
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,190
because i've removed everything from it
at least in my conception

2952
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,200
at least in my conception
 

2953
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,349
at least in my conception
right so what i would really like to

2954
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:21,359
right so what i would really like to
 

2955
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,430
right so what i would really like to
maintain with this data structure

2956
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
maintain with this data structure
 

2957
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,870
maintain with this data structure
is that at no point in time am i using

2958
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:26,880
is that at no point in time am i using
 

2959
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,230
is that at no point in time am i using
more than a linear amount of space

2960
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
more than a linear amount of space
 

2961
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,510
more than a linear amount of space
with respect to the number of things

2962
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:31,520
with respect to the number of things
 

2963
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,309
with respect to the number of things
that are stored in it right

2964
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:34,319
that are stored in it right
 

2965
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,670
that are stored in it right
does that make sense so

2966
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:37,680
does that make sense so
 

2967
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,750
does that make sense so
in a dynamic array

2968
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
in a dynamic array
 

2969
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,910
in a dynamic array
right what we do is when we get

2970
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:45,920
right what we do is when we get
 

2971
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,069
right what we do is when we get
small enough let's resize this thing

2972
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079
small enough let's resize this thing
 

2973
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,190
small enough let's resize this thing
down

2974
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:51,200
down
 

2975
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,390
down
so that we have we're using less space

2976
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
so that we have we're using less space
 

2977
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,069
so that we have we're using less space
okay so when should i as i'm decreasing

2978
00:57:58,069 --> 00:57:58,079
okay so when should i as i'm decreasing
 

2979
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,829
okay so when should i as i'm decreasing
as i'm popping things from the end of

2980
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
as i'm popping things from the end of
 

2981
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,870
as i'm popping things from the end of
this thing

2982
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:00,880
this thing
 

2983
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,230
this thing
right at what point do you think

2984
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,240
right at what point do you think
 

2985
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,430
right at what point do you think
i should rebuild my array when i'm no

2986
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,440
i should rebuild my array when i'm no
 

2987
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,470
i should rebuild my array when i'm no
longer

2988
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
longer
 

2989
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,870
longer
a linear amount well that's a little

2990
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:10,880
a linear amount well that's a little
 

2991
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,910
a linear amount well that's a little
hard to tell

2992
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:11,920
hard to tell
 

2993
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,829
hard to tell
what that is in real life because our

2994
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:13,839
what that is in real life because our
 

2995
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,270
what that is in real life because our
ends aren't arbitrary

2996
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:15,280
ends aren't arbitrary
 

2997
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,789
ends aren't arbitrary
we need to actually have a

2998
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:18,799
we need to actually have a
 

2999
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,270
we need to actually have a
a time at which we need to transition

3000
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,280
a time at which we need to transition
 

3001
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:21,990
a time at which we need to transition
over and copy

3002
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:22,000
over and copy
 

3003
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,829
over and copy
things over so when might we want to do

3004
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:23,839
things over so when might we want to do
 

3005
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,470
things over so when might we want to do
that

3006
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,480

 

3007
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,069

say again after

3008
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
say again after
 

3009
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,270
say again after
n over two removals okay so

3010
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:33,280
n over two removals okay so
 

3011
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,470
n over two removals okay so
i remove n over two things okay so now

3012
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
i remove n over two things okay so now
 

3013
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,150
i remove n over two things okay so now
we're kind of at a

3014
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
we're kind of at a
 

3015
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,030
we're kind of at a
n over four fill rate i mean so we're

3016
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
n over four fill rate i mean so we're
 

3017
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,270
n over four fill rate i mean so we're
using a fourth of the space

3018
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:43,280
using a fourth of the space
 

3019
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,670
using a fourth of the space
okay and now great so you're saying

3020
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:45,680
okay and now great so you're saying
 

3021
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,549
okay and now great so you're saying
rebuild okay so i'll stick everything

3022
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:48,559
rebuild okay so i'll stick everything
 

3023
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,150
rebuild okay so i'll stick everything
in something that's now this is

3024
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:52,160
in something that's now this is
 

3025
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,789
in something that's now this is
m i'm going to call this m and now we're

3026
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:54,799
m i'm going to call this m and now we're
 

3027
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:55,589
m i'm going to call this m and now we're
sticking it

3028
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:55,599
sticking it
 

3029
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,030
sticking it
into something that has size m over 4.

3030
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,040
into something that has size m over 4.
 

3031
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,150
into something that has size m over 4.
sound good yeah

3032
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:04,160
sound good yeah
 

3033
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,030
sound good yeah
yeah everyone okay with this

3034
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,040

 

3035
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,349

oh okay so what you're saying is that we

3036
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:13,359
oh okay so what you're saying is that we
 

3037
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,190
oh okay so what you're saying is that we
we actually want to keep some extra

3038
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:15,200
we actually want to keep some extra
 

3039
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,549
we actually want to keep some extra
space back here

3040
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559
space back here
 

3041
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,510
space back here
right and why is that

3042
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:21,520

 

3043
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,670

because imagine if we just allocated

3044
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:23,680
because imagine if we just allocated
 

3045
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,430
because imagine if we just allocated
this amount of space

3046
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:25,440
this amount of space
 

3047
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,549
this amount of space
and i removed the m

3048
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
and i removed the m
 

3049
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,349
and i removed the m
over four plus one item here we resize

3050
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:31,359
over four plus one item here we resize
 

3051
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,510
over four plus one item here we resize
down to this thing

3052
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:33,520
down to this thing
 

3053
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,069
down to this thing
and then i want to do an insertion again

3054
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:36,079
and then i want to do an insertion again
 

3055
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,670
and then i want to do an insertion again
right

3056
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,680
right
 

3057
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,349
right
well then i have to re-expand out to

3058
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
well then i have to re-expand out to
 

3059
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,190
well then i have to re-expand out to
something like this right

3060
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:41,200
something like this right
 

3061
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,910
something like this right
and that's maybe not going to be a good

3062
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:43,920
and that's maybe not going to be a good
 

3063
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,589
and that's maybe not going to be a good
thing right we might have to bounce back

3064
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:45,599
thing right we might have to bounce back
 

3065
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:45,990
thing right we might have to bounce back
and forth

3066
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,000
and forth
 

3067
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,750
and forth
a lot that's that's hard for me to think

3068
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:47,760
a lot that's that's hard for me to think
 

3069
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,270
a lot that's that's hard for me to think
about what we're going to do

3070
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,280
about what we're going to do
 

3071
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,549
about what we're going to do
right but if we

3072
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:52,559
right but if we
 

3073
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,349
right but if we
always resize to a fill ratio that

3074
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359
always resize to a fill ratio that
 

3075
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,950
always resize to a fill ratio that
includes a linear amount of things on

3076
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:56,960
includes a linear amount of things on
 

3077
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,470
includes a linear amount of things on
the end

3078
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:58,480
the end
 

3079
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,230
the end
then i know that when i resize down

3080
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:02,240
then i know that when i resize down
 

3081
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,630
then i know that when i resize down
you know i'll be doing either a linear

3082
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:04,640
you know i'll be doing either a linear
 

3083
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,309
you know i'll be doing either a linear
number of deletions or a linear number

3084
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:06,319
number of deletions or a linear number
 

3085
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:07,829
number of deletions or a linear number
of insertions before i have to rebuild

3086
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:07,839
of insertions before i have to rebuild
 

3087
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,190
of insertions before i have to rebuild
again

3088
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
again
 

3089
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,910
again
right so this charging argument again i

3090
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
right so this charging argument again i
 

3091
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,190
right so this charging argument again i
have to do a linear number of cheap

3092
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,200
have to do a linear number of cheap
 

3093
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,710
have to do a linear number of cheap
things before i have to do an expensive

3094
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:14,720
things before i have to do an expensive
 

3095
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,750
things before i have to do an expensive
thing again

3096
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:15,760
thing again
 

3097
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,349
thing again
okay so i resize down to

3098
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:19,359
okay so i resize down to
 

3099
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,230
okay so i resize down to
b still keep a linear amount of extra

3100
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
b still keep a linear amount of extra
 

3101
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,109
b still keep a linear amount of extra
space at the end

3102
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:23,119
space at the end
 

3103
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,630
space at the end
right and with the double ended thing

3104
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:26,640
right and with the double ended thing
 

3105
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,270
right and with the double ended thing
you can write the same kind of policy

3106
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
you can write the same kind of policy
 

3107
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:29,829
you can write the same kind of policy
right

3108
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:29,839
right
 

3109
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,990
right
with the extra space as your colleague

3110
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:32,000
with the extra space as your colleague
 

3111
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,750
with the extra space as your colleague
was saying we can just

3112
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:33,760
was saying we can just
 

3113
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,589
was saying we can just
resize down always to shift

3114
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:37,599
resize down always to shift
 

3115
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:43,109
resize down always to shift
these things to be placed in the middle

3116
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:43,119
these things to be placed in the middle
 

3117
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,870
these things to be placed in the middle
with a linear amount of extra space on

3118
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:44,880
with a linear amount of extra space on
 

3119
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,150
with a linear amount of extra space on
the ends right

3120
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:48,160

 

3121
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,349

does that make sense

3122
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:51,359

 

3123
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,470

no questions all right

3124
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,480
no questions all right
 

3125
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,430
no questions all right
that was a way in which we kind of had

3126
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:57,440
that was a way in which we kind of had
 

3127
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,589
that was a way in which we kind of had
to redefine an entirely new data

3128
01:00:59,589 --> 01:00:59,599
to redefine an entirely new data
 

3129
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:00,630
to redefine an entirely new data
structure

3130
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,640
structure
 

3131
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,670
structure
right we took the ideas behind dynamic

3132
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:03,680
right we took the ideas behind dynamic
 

3133
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,630
right we took the ideas behind dynamic
arrays

3134
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
arrays
 

3135
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,510
arrays
and we extended those ideas to make this

3136
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:07,520
and we extended those ideas to make this
 

3137
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,230
and we extended those ideas to make this
thing have

3138
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:08,240
thing have
 

3139
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,069
thing have
extra space on both ends but we kind of

3140
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:10,079
extra space on both ends but we kind of
 

3141
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,710
extra space on both ends but we kind of
had to do that re-implementation all by

3142
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
had to do that re-implementation all by
 

3143
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,710
had to do that re-implementation all by
ourselves right if we were doing code

3144
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:14,720
ourselves right if we were doing code
 

3145
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,750
ourselves right if we were doing code
that would be kind of gnarly okay but

3146
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
that would be kind of gnarly okay but
 

3147
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,710
that would be kind of gnarly okay but
what if someone just

3148
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:18,720
what if someone just
 

3149
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,510
what if someone just
gave us a dynamic array right like what

3150
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:21,520
gave us a dynamic array right like what
 

3151
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,270
gave us a dynamic array right like what
if someone gave you a python list

3152
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
if someone gave you a python list
 

3153
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,829
if someone gave you a python list
right and you wanted this functionality

3154
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
right and you wanted this functionality
 

3155
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,670
right and you wanted this functionality
right

3156
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,680
right
 

3157
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,349
right
i don't want to re-implement a dynamic

3158
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:29,359
i don't want to re-implement a dynamic
 

3159
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,510
i don't want to re-implement a dynamic
array but i want this behavior so how

3160
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,520
array but i want this behavior so how
 

3161
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,990
array but i want this behavior so how
any way that i could do that by reducing

3162
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
any way that i could do that by reducing
 

3163
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,030
any way that i could do that by reducing
to using

3164
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,040
to using
 

3165
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,710
to using
a dynamic array this kind of running

3166
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:38,720
a dynamic array this kind of running
 

3167
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,789
a dynamic array this kind of running
time

3168
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:42,799

 

3169
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,750

no no no one no one thinks that we can

3170
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:45,760
no no no one no one thinks that we can
 

3171
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,309
no no no one no one thinks that we can
do this

3172
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:46,319
do this
 

3173
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:53,430
do this
this is impossible no no ideas

3174
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
this is impossible no no ideas
 

3175
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,309
this is impossible no no ideas
no ideas how could i use some let's say

3176
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
no ideas how could i use some let's say
 

3177
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,510
no ideas how could i use some let's say
i had

3178
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:57,520
i had
 

3179
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,230
i had
i have a dynamic array

3180
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:02,240

 

3181
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:08,230

right that's good on one side

3182
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240

 

3183
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,390

is there anything i can do to support

3184
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:10,400
is there anything i can do to support
 

3185
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,069
is there anything i can do to support
dynamic operations on both sides of a

3186
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:12,079
dynamic operations on both sides of a
 

3187
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,029
dynamic operations on both sides of a
sequence

3188
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:15,039

 

3189
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,430

yeah are we able to just use like a

3190
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:17,440
yeah are we able to just use like a
 

3191
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,430
yeah are we able to just use like a
second dynamic already

3192
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:23,440

 

3193
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,549

i like oh that's supposed to be empty

3194
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559
i like oh that's supposed to be empty
 

3195
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,630
i like oh that's supposed to be empty
right

3196
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:30,640

 

3197
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,470

yeah so what your colleague is saying

3198
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:32,480
yeah so what your colleague is saying
 

3199
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,990
yeah so what your colleague is saying
yeah let's do that right

3200
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,000
yeah let's do that right
 

3201
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,829
yeah let's do that right
let's have one pointing forwards one

3202
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:35,839
let's have one pointing forwards one
 

3203
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,430
let's have one pointing forwards one
pointing backwards right this is the

3204
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,440
pointing backwards right this is the
 

3205
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,029
pointing backwards right this is the
first of a certain thing

3206
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:39,039
first of a certain thing
 

3207
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,750
first of a certain thing
right when we were doing just a dynamic

3208
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:41,760
right when we were doing just a dynamic
 

3209
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,390
right when we were doing just a dynamic
array

3210
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400
array
 

3211
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,789
array
here where we had to rebuild everything

3212
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:44,799
here where we had to rebuild everything
 

3213
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,230
here where we had to rebuild everything
it was important that we kept

3214
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:46,240
it was important that we kept
 

3215
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,510
it was important that we kept
track of where the front thing was right

3216
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
track of where the front thing was right
 

3217
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,870
track of where the front thing was right
so that we could do constant time

3218
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:50,880
so that we could do constant time
 

3219
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,710
so that we could do constant time
indexing right we could

3220
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:52,720
indexing right we could
 

3221
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,510
indexing right we could
as this thing changed we would now have

3222
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
as this thing changed we would now have
 

3223
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,549
as this thing changed we would now have
to compute

3224
01:02:56,549 --> 01:02:56,559
to compute
 

3225
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,549
to compute
where our index was in this thing by

3226
01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559
where our index was in this thing by
 

3227
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,309
where our index was in this thing by
adding it to where the front was

3228
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:00,319
adding it to where the front was
 

3229
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:03,670
adding it to where the front was
right okay on this one

3230
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
right okay on this one
 

3231
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,309
right okay on this one
we've got some similar problems so what

3232
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319
we've got some similar problems so what
 

3233
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,549
we've got some similar problems so what
i'm going to do is i'm going to divide

3234
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:08,559
i'm going to do is i'm going to divide
 

3235
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,950
i'm going to do is i'm going to divide
the sequence i'm trying to store up into

3236
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:10,960
the sequence i'm trying to store up into
 

3237
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,910
the sequence i'm trying to store up into
two

3238
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
two
 

3239
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,069
two
sections right maybe about the same size

3240
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
sections right maybe about the same size
 

3241
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,390
sections right maybe about the same size
right so each of these contains a linear

3242
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
right so each of these contains a linear
 

3243
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,990
right so each of these contains a linear
number of items

3244
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,000
number of items
 

3245
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,349
number of items
that's how i'm going to instantiate my

3246
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
that's how i'm going to instantiate my
 

3247
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:22,710
that's how i'm going to instantiate my
thing with a linear amount of extra

3248
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:22,720
thing with a linear amount of extra
 

3249
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,910
thing with a linear amount of extra
space on both ends

3250
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:23,920
space on both ends
 

3251
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,990
space on both ends
okay so now as i insert on either side

3252
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:28,000
okay so now as i insert on either side
 

3253
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,230
okay so now as i insert on either side
or delete from either side it's going to

3254
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:30,240
or delete from either side it's going to
 

3255
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,870
or delete from either side it's going to
work just like a dynamic array right i

3256
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
work just like a dynamic array right i
 

3257
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,789
work just like a dynamic array right i
have to do some arithmetic here

3258
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
have to do some arithmetic here
 

3259
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,029
have to do some arithmetic here
to figure out where if i was trying to

3260
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:37,039
to figure out where if i was trying to
 

3261
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,549
to figure out where if i was trying to
access these items

3262
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
access these items
 

3263
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,510
access these items
i'd have to like subtract from wherever

3264
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
i'd have to like subtract from wherever
 

3265
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,230
i'd have to like subtract from wherever
this thing was

3266
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
this thing was
 

3267
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,349
this thing was
right i'd have to do some index

3268
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
right i'd have to do some index
 

3269
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,589
right i'd have to do some index
arithmetic but you know that's

3270
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:45,599
arithmetic but you know that's
 

3271
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,309
arithmetic but you know that's
tedious but you know you could do it

3272
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
tedious but you know you could do it
 

3273
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,349
tedious but you know you could do it
right

3274
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:49,359
right
 

3275
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:53,190
right
okay there's one caveat one problem that

3276
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:53,200
okay there's one caveat one problem that
 

3277
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,390
okay there's one caveat one problem that
you run into

3278
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
you run into
 

3279
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,470
you run into
in using something like this and what

3280
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:56,480
in using something like this and what
 

3281
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,470
in using something like this and what
would that be

3282
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:58,480
would that be
 

3283
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,270
would that be
yeah i'm not sure that you can't store

3284
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,280
yeah i'm not sure that you can't store
 

3285
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,150
yeah i'm not sure that you can't store
things

3286
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:02,160
things
 

3287
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,549
things
in the second half

3288
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:06,559

 

3289
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,549

in here in here

3290
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
in here in here
 

3291
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,549
in here in here
right so what i'm doing here is actually

3292
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:12,559
right so what i'm doing here is actually
 

3293
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,270
right so what i'm doing here is actually
i'm thinking of this as

3294
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,280
i'm thinking of this as
 

3295
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,069
i'm thinking of this as
two dynamic arrays but i'm viewing this

3296
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
two dynamic arrays but i'm viewing this
 

3297
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,910
two dynamic arrays but i'm viewing this
one in reverse

3298
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:19,920
one in reverse
 

3299
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,950
one in reverse
right so this is actually

3300
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:22,960
right so this is actually
 

3301
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,630
right so this is actually
the last of this dynamic array does that

3302
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
the last of this dynamic array does that
 

3303
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,670
the last of this dynamic array does that
make sense

3304
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:27,680
make sense
 

3305
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,270
make sense
all right so if that's the situation

3306
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,280
all right so if that's the situation
 

3307
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,309
all right so if that's the situation
i'm in is am i done do i

3308
01:04:34,309 --> 01:04:34,319
i'm in is am i done do i
 

3309
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,910
i'm in is am i done do i
do i have to care about anything else

3310
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:37,920

 

3311
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,390

you guys are all like we're done and i

3312
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
you guys are all like we're done and i
 

3313
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,109
you guys are all like we're done and i
would not give you full points

3314
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
would not give you full points
 

3315
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:51,510
would not give you full points
why aren't we done

3316
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,520

 

3317
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:59,750

uh well so

3318
01:04:59,750 --> 01:04:59,760

 

3319
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,750

okay so what your colleague is saying is

3320
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:01,760
okay so what your colleague is saying is
 

3321
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,510
okay so what your colleague is saying is
we somehow have to merge these into one

3322
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:03,520
we somehow have to merge these into one
 

3323
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,230
we somehow have to merge these into one
array

3324
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
array
 

3325
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,230
array
so we're getting around that by kind of

3326
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
so we're getting around that by kind of
 

3327
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,349
so we're getting around that by kind of
keeping indexes

3328
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
keeping indexes
 

3329
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:08,950
keeping indexes
to here and being able to do index

3330
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:08,960
to here and being able to do index
 

3331
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,510
to here and being able to do index
arithmetic to kind of simulate

3332
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,520
arithmetic to kind of simulate
 

3333
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,309
arithmetic to kind of simulate
an array underneath right so we can

3334
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
an array underneath right so we can
 

3335
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,710
an array underneath right so we can
compute where these indices should be

3336
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
compute where these indices should be
 

3337
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,510
compute where these indices should be
okay anyone have another problem with

3338
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:19,520
okay anyone have another problem with
 

3339
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,630
okay anyone have another problem with
with

3340
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
with
 

3341
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,470
with
an underspecified data structure here

3342
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:22,480
an underspecified data structure here
 

3343
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,950
an underspecified data structure here
yeah

3344
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:28,960

 

3345
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,270

i see so what your colleague is saying

3346
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,280
i see so what your colleague is saying
 

3347
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,270
i see so what your colleague is saying
which is exactly correct

3348
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:33,280
which is exactly correct
 

3349
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,029
which is exactly correct
if i were removing things removing

3350
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:35,039
if i were removing things removing
 

3351
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,950
if i were removing things removing
things removing things uh i have nothing

3352
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
things removing things uh i have nothing
 

3353
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,069
things removing things uh i have nothing
else

3354
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:38,079
else
 

3355
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,309
else
in here if i try to pop from this end

3356
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:40,319
in here if i try to pop from this end
 

3357
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:41,270
in here if i try to pop from this end
again

3358
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:41,280
again
 

3359
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,630
again
i'm gonna have to pop from the beginning

3360
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:42,640
i'm gonna have to pop from the beginning
 

3361
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,630
i'm gonna have to pop from the beginning
of this thing which i don't

3362
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
of this thing which i don't
 

3363
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,470
of this thing which i don't
really that's that's gonna break

3364
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:46,480
really that's that's gonna break
 

3365
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,150
really that's that's gonna break
something of what i'm doing right it's

3366
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:48,160
something of what i'm doing right it's
 

3367
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,670
something of what i'm doing right it's
not maintaining the invariance of what i

3368
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:49,680
not maintaining the invariance of what i
 

3369
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,349
not maintaining the invariance of what i
want on my data structure

3370
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359
want on my data structure
 

3371
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,829
want on my data structure
and so the only caveat here is that when

3372
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:53,839
and so the only caveat here is that when
 

3373
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,230
and so the only caveat here is that when
i reduce down to one of these

3374
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,240
i reduce down to one of these
 

3375
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:01,829
i reduce down to one of these
is empty what do i do

3376
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:01,839

 

3377
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,230

you could cut this thing in half move

3378
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:04,240
you could cut this thing in half move
 

3379
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,829
you could cut this thing in half move
these elements over

3380
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:05,839
these elements over
 

3381
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,109
these elements over
but that's going to leave these things

3382
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:07,119
but that's going to leave these things
 

3383
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,829
but that's going to leave these things
in the middle here right

3384
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
in the middle here right
 

3385
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,390
in the middle here right
the nice thing that happens here is i've

3386
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:12,400
the nice thing that happens here is i've
 

3387
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,789
the nice thing that happens here is i've
done a linear number of options

3388
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
done a linear number of options
 

3389
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,069
done a linear number of options
operations i have i i now

3390
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:18,079
operations i have i i now
 

3391
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,510
operations i have i i now
have an amortized cost buildup that i

3392
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:21,520
have an amortized cost buildup that i
 

3393
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,109
have an amortized cost buildup that i
can spend

3394
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
can spend
 

3395
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,670
can spend
to now rebuild the entire data structure

3396
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
to now rebuild the entire data structure
 

3397
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,870
to now rebuild the entire data structure
does that make sense

3398
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:26,880
does that make sense
 

3399
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,789
does that make sense
right i can now once i get down to this

3400
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:28,799
right i can now once i get down to this
 

3401
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,150
right i can now once i get down to this
thing you know take

3402
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:30,160
thing you know take
 

3403
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,309
thing you know take
whatever the remaining things are split

3404
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:32,319
whatever the remaining things are split
 

3405
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,230
whatever the remaining things are split
in half put it into two entirely new

3406
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
in half put it into two entirely new
 

3407
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,069
in half put it into two entirely new
arrays copy them all over

3408
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:36,079
arrays copy them all over
 

3409
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,069
arrays copy them all over
and now i've restored my invariant where

3410
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:38,079
and now i've restored my invariant where
 

3411
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,789
and now i've restored my invariant where
i'm again a linear amount of operations

3412
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:40,799
i'm again a linear amount of operations
 

3413
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:43,430
i'm again a linear amount of operations
away from having to do

3414
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:43,440
away from having to do
 

3415
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,589
away from having to do
an expensive operation again does that

3416
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
an expensive operation again does that
 

3417
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,230
an expensive operation again does that
make sense

3418
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,240

 

3419
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,270

so while we were able to reduce to using

3420
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:51,280
so while we were able to reduce to using
 

3421
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,710
so while we were able to reduce to using
these dynamic arrays for

3422
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:52,720
these dynamic arrays for
 

3423
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,150
these dynamic arrays for
a lot of the cases right we actually had

3424
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
a lot of the cases right we actually had
 

3425
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,029
a lot of the cases right we actually had
to do

3426
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
to do
 

3427
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,309
to do
a little bit more work to make this work

3428
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:00,319
a little bit more work to make this work
 

3429
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:00,950
a little bit more work to make this work
out

3430
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:00,960
out
 

3431
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,390
out
that makes sense okay cool so that's

3432
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,400
that makes sense okay cool so that's
 

3433
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,789
that makes sense okay cool so that's
that's two ways of approaching problem

3434
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:06,799
that's two ways of approaching problem
 

3435
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:07,750
that's two ways of approaching problem
three

3436
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:07,760
three
 

3437
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,789
three
okay in the last little bit

3438
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
okay in the last little bit
 

3439
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,910
okay in the last little bit
we're going to talk about the last

3440
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:13,920
we're going to talk about the last
 

3441
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,789
we're going to talk about the last
problem

3442
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:14,799
problem
 

3443
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,549
problem
all right that makes sense i'm going to

3444
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:16,559
all right that makes sense i'm going to
 

3445
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:17,990
all right that makes sense i'm going to
erase this picture if that's all right

3446
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
erase this picture if that's all right
 

3447
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,390
erase this picture if that's all right
with you guys

3448
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:22,400

 

3449
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,349

what's up it's not all right well too

3450
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:25,359
what's up it's not all right well too
 

3451
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:25,829
what's up it's not all right well too
bad

3452
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:25,839
bad
 

3453
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,789
bad
all right watch the video okay so

3454
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
all right watch the video okay so
 

3455
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,190
all right watch the video okay so
problem four

3456
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:31,200
problem four
 

3457
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,789
problem four
also a fairly

3458
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:34,799
also a fairly
 

3459
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,829
also a fairly
uh accessible shall we say code in

3460
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:37,839
uh accessible shall we say code in
 

3461
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:38,789
uh accessible shall we say code in
question

3462
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
question
 

3463
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:41,430
question
okay what we're doing on problem four is

3464
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
okay what we're doing on problem four is
 

3465
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:41,990
okay what we're doing on problem four is
we've got this

3466
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,000
we've got this
 

3467
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,710
we've got this
nice little story at the beginning which

3468
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:44,720
nice little story at the beginning which
 

3469
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,349
nice little story at the beginning which
is about

3470
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
is about
 

3471
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,630
is about
this this woman jen and her friend barry

3472
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:48,640
this this woman jen and her friend barry
 

3473
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,549
this this woman jen and her friend barry
who are trying to sell ice cream to

3474
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
who are trying to sell ice cream to
 

3475
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:51,910
who are trying to sell ice cream to
elementary school kids

3476
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:51,920
elementary school kids
 

3477
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,589
elementary school kids
they're basically lined up at jen's

3478
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:53,599
they're basically lined up at jen's
 

3479
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,190
they're basically lined up at jen's
truck and she's like oh there's too many

3480
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:55,200
truck and she's like oh there's too many
 

3481
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,470
truck and she's like oh there's too many
students here

3482
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
students here
 

3483
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,470
students here
so she calls up for friend barry he has

3484
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
so she calls up for friend barry he has
 

3485
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,230
so she calls up for friend barry he has
another ice cream truck

3486
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
another ice cream truck
 

3487
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,309
another ice cream truck
parks at the end of the line and the

3488
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
parks at the end of the line and the
 

3489
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,230
parks at the end of the line and the
students what they want to do is to make

3490
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:04,240
students what they want to do is to make
 

3491
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,750
students what they want to do is to make
it more fair

3492
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:05,760
it more fair
 

3493
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,430
it more fair
is they're going to take the last half

3494
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
is they're going to take the last half
 

3495
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,710
is they're going to take the last half
of the line reverse it

3496
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:10,720
of the line reverse it
 

3497
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,870
of the line reverse it
to make it more fair i don't know it's a

3498
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:12,880
to make it more fair i don't know it's a
 

3499
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,549
to make it more fair i don't know it's a
stupid situation

3500
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:14,559
stupid situation
 

3501
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,630
stupid situation
but the underlying thing is what we're

3502
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
but the underlying thing is what we're
 

3503
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,070
but the underlying thing is what we're
doing is part a

01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,269
linked list
a singly linked list

3510
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279

 

3511
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,789

right and what i want you to do

3512
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:30,799
right and what i want you to do
 

3513
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:34,470
right and what i want you to do
this singly linked list all it has is

3514
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:34,480
this singly linked list all it has is
 

3515
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,829
this singly linked list all it has is
a notion of size how long it is right it

3516
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
a notion of size how long it is right it
 

3517
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:41,829
a notion of size how long it is right it
has a size and it has a head

3518
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839

 

3519
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,910

this list it has a size and it has a

3520
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:43,920
this list it has a size and it has a
 

3521
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,870
this list it has a size and it has a
head

3522
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
head
 

3523
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,229
head
okay and this head is a pointer to a

3524
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
okay and this head is a pointer to a
 

3525
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:50,550
okay and this head is a pointer to a
node and the node has

3526
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:50,560
node and the node has
 

3527
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,910
node and the node has
kind of just one two two things stored

3528
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:53,920
kind of just one two two things stored
 

3529
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,550
kind of just one two two things stored
in it right

3530
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:54,560
in it right
 

3531
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,749
in it right
it has who which the name of the child

3532
01:08:57,749 --> 01:08:57,759
it has who which the name of the child
 

3533
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:58,709
it has who which the name of the child
that's there

3534
01:08:58,709 --> 01:08:58,719
that's there
 

3535
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,950
that's there
right and the next pointer to the next

3536
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:00,960
right and the next pointer to the next
 

3537
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,950
right and the next pointer to the next
node right that's what a singly linked

3538
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:02,960
node right that's what a singly linked
 

3539
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,070
node right that's what a singly linked
list is so

3540
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,080
list is so
 

3541
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,189
list is so
node has a an

3542
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
node has a an
 

3543
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,550
node has a an
item key and a next pointer

3544
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:10,560
item key and a next pointer
 

3545
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,990
item key and a next pointer
okay this next pointer points to the

3546
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:12,000
okay this next pointer points to the
 

3547
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,950
okay this next pointer points to the
next node in the sequence okay

3548
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:14,960
next node in the sequence okay
 

3549
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,269
next node in the sequence okay
and the question is asking

3550
01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:19,279
and the question is asking
 

3551
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,390
and the question is asking
if we give you a linked list that has

3552
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
if we give you a linked list that has
 

3553
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,709
if we give you a linked list that has
two n nodes i want you to take the last

3554
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:26,719
two n nodes i want you to take the last
 

3555
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,149
two n nodes i want you to take the last
n nodes and reverse their order

3556
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:30,159
n nodes and reverse their order
 

3557
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,829
n nodes and reverse their order
and do this to the data structure you're

3558
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:33,839
and do this to the data structure you're
 

3559
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:36,309
and do this to the data structure you're
not going to return a new data structure

3560
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:36,319
not going to return a new data structure
 

3561
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,070
not going to return a new data structure
right you're going to do this you're

3562
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:38,080
right you're going to do this you're
 

3563
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,149
right you're going to do this you're
going to modify the existing nodes and

3564
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:40,159
going to modify the existing nodes and
 

3565
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:41,110
going to modify the existing nodes and
actually

3566
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:41,120
actually
 

3567
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,990
actually
here is goes back to your question right

3568
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,000
here is goes back to your question right
 

3569
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,349
here is goes back to your question right
is

3570
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
is
 

3571
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,709
is
uh can what are we limited to in how we

3572
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:48,719
uh can what are we limited to in how we
 

3573
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,269
uh can what are we limited to in how we
approach this problem what this uh

3574
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:51,279
approach this problem what this uh
 

3575
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:52,870
approach this problem what this uh
problem says is your algorithm should

3576
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
problem says is your algorithm should
 

3577
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,510
problem says is your algorithm should
not make

3578
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,520
not make
 

3579
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,310
not make
any new linked list nodes or instantiate

3580
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:56,320
any new linked list nodes or instantiate
 

3581
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,310
any new linked list nodes or instantiate
any new non-constant size data

3582
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,320
any new non-constant size data
 

3583
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,030
any new non-constant size data
structures

3584
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
structures
 

3585
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,350
structures
right so it's not like i can read

3586
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:01,360
right so it's not like i can read
 

3587
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,510
right so it's not like i can read
through this whole thing

3588
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:03,520
through this whole thing
 

3589
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,790
through this whole thing
find out where the n plus one node is

3590
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,800
find out where the n plus one node is
 

3591
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,750
find out where the n plus one node is
read out all of those names store them

3592
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:09,760
read out all of those names store them
 

3593
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,110
read out all of those names store them
in an array somewhere

3594
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:11,120
in an array somewhere
 

3595
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,229
in an array somewhere
and then rewrite them back out right i'm

3596
01:10:14,229 --> 01:10:14,239
and then rewrite them back out right i'm
 

3597
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:15,270
and then rewrite them back out right i'm
not allowed to

3598
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280
not allowed to
 

3599
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,350
not allowed to
store more than a constant amount of

3600
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:17,360
store more than a constant amount of
 

3601
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,350
store more than a constant amount of
stuff outside of this linked list and

3602
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:19,360
stuff outside of this linked list and
 

3603
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,270
stuff outside of this linked list and
i'm not able to make any new nodes

3604
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:21,280
i'm not able to make any new nodes
 

3605
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,669
i'm not able to make any new nodes
essentially i just have to probably keep

3606
01:10:23,669 --> 01:10:23,679
essentially i just have to probably keep
 

3607
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:25,189
essentially i just have to probably keep
these items where they are

3608
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:25,199
these items where they are
 

3609
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:31,910
these items where they are
and move around the nodes yeah

3610
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:31,920

 

3611
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,149

uh so if you're using non-constant space

3612
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:36,159
uh so if you're using non-constant space
 

3613
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:37,990
uh so if you're using non-constant space
you're instantiating some kind of data

3614
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:38,000
you're instantiating some kind of data
 

3615
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,430
you're instantiating some kind of data
structure whether it be in

3616
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:39,440
structure whether it be in
 

3617
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:46,070
structure whether it be in
an array right or

3618
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,080

 

3619
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,669

sure i'm wanting you not to do that

3620
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:49,679
sure i'm wanting you not to do that
 

3621
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,470
sure i'm wanting you not to do that
yeah yeah

3622
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,480

 

3623
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,070

any other questions

3624
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:58,080
any other questions
 

3625
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,830
any other questions
so

3626
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:01,840

 

3627
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:08,870

how are we going to do this problem

3628
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:08,880

 

3629
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,070

anybody anyone have approach

3630
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,080
anybody anyone have approach
 

3631
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,510
anybody anyone have approach
for how i might approach this problem

3632
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:13,520
for how i might approach this problem
 

3633
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,270
for how i might approach this problem
yeah

3634
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,280
yeah
 

3635
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,070
yeah
in order to get to the second half you

3636
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:18,080
in order to get to the second half you
 

3637
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,709
in order to get to the second half you
have to

3638
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:18,719
have to
 

3639
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,590
have to
do like oh then over two times so sure

3640
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:21,600
do like oh then over two times so sure
 

3641
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,470
do like oh then over two times so sure
could you start

3642
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:22,480
could you start
 

3643
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,310
could you start
like uh i probably start counting

3644
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:26,320
like uh i probably start counting
 

3645
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,990
like uh i probably start counting
backwards so that you can get them

3646
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
backwards so that you can get them
 

3647
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,149
backwards so that you can get them
in the back order and then meet it in

3648
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
in the back order and then meet it in
 

3649
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,229
in the back order and then meet it in
the middle so then say

3650
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:32,239
the middle so then say
 

3651
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,470
the middle so then say
interesting so there's there's a lot of

3652
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
interesting so there's there's a lot of
 

3653
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,669
interesting so there's there's a lot of
things going so the

3654
01:11:35,669 --> 01:11:35,679
things going so the
 

3655
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,510
things going so the
let's let's break this down so a lot of

3656
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
let's let's break this down so a lot of
 

3657
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,470
let's let's break this down so a lot of
times when we're asking you to

3658
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:40,480
times when we're asking you to
 

3659
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,630
times when we're asking you to
construct an algorithm a lot of times it

3660
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,640
construct an algorithm a lot of times it
 

3661
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,070
construct an algorithm a lot of times it
makes sense to kind of

3662
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,080
makes sense to kind of
 

3663
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,310
makes sense to kind of
develop an outline or a game plan of

3664
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,320
develop an outline or a game plan of
 

3665
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,310
develop an outline or a game plan of
kind of constituent parts

3666
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:48,320
kind of constituent parts
 

3667
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,430
kind of constituent parts
that you might want to approach this

3668
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:49,440
that you might want to approach this
 

3669
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,510
that you might want to approach this
problem with right like so the first

3670
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:51,520
problem with right like so the first
 

3671
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,390
problem with right like so the first
thing that your

3672
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:52,400
thing that your
 

3673
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,630
thing that your
colleague over here was saying was at

3674
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
colleague over here was saying was at
 

3675
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,990
colleague over here was saying was at
some point we need to find out where the

3676
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,000
some point we need to find out where the
 

3677
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,030
some point we need to find out where the
middle of this thing is

3678
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,040
middle of this thing is
 

3679
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,149
middle of this thing is
right does that make sense

3680
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:00,159
right does that make sense
 

3681
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,390
right does that make sense
so maybe the first thing we want to do

3682
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,400
so maybe the first thing we want to do
 

3683
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,830
so maybe the first thing we want to do
to approach this problem

3684
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:06,840

 

3685
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,430

is one

3686
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:09,440
is one
 

3687
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,550
is one
find nth

3688
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:12,560
find nth
 

3689
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,830
find nth
node okay that's the

3690
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:15,840
node okay that's the
 

3691
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:22,390
node okay that's the
end of the first set of children okay

3692
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,400
end of the first set of children okay
 

3693
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,709
end of the first set of children okay
then

3694
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719

 

3695
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,870

i have a second thing that i want to do

3696
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880
i have a second thing that i want to do
 

3697
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,229
i have a second thing that i want to do
what's the next thing i have to do i

3698
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:30,239
what's the next thing i have to do i
 

3699
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,189
what's the next thing i have to do i
have to

3700
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
have to
 

3701
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,350
have to
kind of reverse the pointers of

3702
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,360
kind of reverse the pointers of
 

3703
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,310
kind of reverse the pointers of
everything after the nth note right okay

3704
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,320
everything after the nth note right okay
 

3705
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,990
everything after the nth note right okay
so second thing

3706
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:40,000

 

3707
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,590

reverse

3708
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:43,600

 

3709
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:55,590

i guess next pointers

3710
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,600

 

3711
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,910

of everything after the nth node

3712
01:12:59,910 --> 01:12:59,920
of everything after the nth node
 

3713
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,270
of everything after the nth node
right the nodes n plus 1 to 2n

3714
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:03,280
right the nodes n plus 1 to 2n
 

3715
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,790
right the nodes n plus 1 to 2n
does that make sense

3716
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:06,800

 

3717
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,390

and after i've reversed all of those

3718
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:08,400
and after i've reversed all of those
 

3719
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,910
and after i've reversed all of those
things

3720
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:09,920
things
 

3721
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,750
things
what do i have i have a first block this

3722
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:13,760
what do i have i have a first block this
 

3723
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,270
what do i have i have a first block this
points like that

3724
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,280
points like that
 

3725
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,350
points like that
and now we've got this thing

3726
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:19,360
and now we've got this thing
 

3727
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,149
and now we've got this thing
and we've reversed all the pointers

3728
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:24,159

 

3729
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:27,270

like this

3730
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:27,280

 

3731
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,870

so that's after step two is that

3732
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:30,880
so that's after step two is that
 

3733
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,110
so that's after step two is that
what we want

3734
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120

 

3735
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,709

yeah step three would be um

3736
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:38,719
yeah step three would be um
 

3737
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,990
yeah step three would be um
you don't find the flat the pointer

3738
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,000

 

3739
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,030

so this is my new end right

3740
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,040
so this is my new end right
 

3741
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,229
so this is my new end right
i'm going to call this node a and this

3742
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:50,239
i'm going to call this node a and this
 

3743
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:51,910
i'm going to call this node a and this
node b

3744
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:51,920
node b
 

3745
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,270
node b
okay and this node c

3746
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:55,280
okay and this node c
 

3747
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,310
okay and this node c
okay so tell me in terms of a

3748
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:58,320
okay so tell me in terms of a
 

3749
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,470
okay so tell me in terms of a
b and c what i'm supposed to do yeah

3750
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,480
b and c what i'm supposed to do yeah
 

3751
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,149
b and c what i'm supposed to do yeah
question how old we reverse the next

3752
01:14:02,149 --> 01:14:02,159
question how old we reverse the next
 

3753
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,350
question how old we reverse the next
pointer

3754
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
pointer
 

3755
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,350
pointer
i mean i get what you're talking about

3756
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:05,360
i mean i get what you're talking about
 

3757
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,630
i mean i get what you're talking about
like right to

3758
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:06,640
like right to
 

3759
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,950
like right to
actually make that happen yeah so to

3760
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:08,960
actually make that happen yeah so to
 

3761
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,630
actually make that happen yeah so to
actually make that happen this thing has

3762
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:10,640
actually make that happen this thing has
 

3763
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,830
actually make that happen this thing has
a next pointer

3764
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:11,840
a next pointer
 

3765
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,430
a next pointer
right it's pointed to some pointing to

3766
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,440
right it's pointed to some pointing to
 

3767
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,030
right it's pointed to some pointing to
some node but i don't necess

3768
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:15,040
some node but i don't necess
 

3769
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,470
some node but i don't necess
i'm needing to relink it to the thing

3770
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
i'm needing to relink it to the thing
 

3771
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,350
i'm needing to relink it to the thing
before me right so i better remember

3772
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:19,360
before me right so i better remember
 

3773
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,630
before me right so i better remember
what was before me so i can set you know

3774
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
what was before me so i can set you know
 

3775
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,110
what was before me so i can set you know
node b dot next equals the thing before

3776
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,120
node b dot next equals the thing before
 

3777
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,470
node b dot next equals the thing before
me instead of the thing after me does

3778
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:26,480
me instead of the thing after me does
 

3779
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,350
me instead of the thing after me does
that make sense

3780
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
that make sense
 

3781
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,790
that make sense
so that would be re-linking the point

3782
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:28,800
so that would be re-linking the point
 

3783
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,590
so that would be re-linking the point
next it disconnects the link list

3784
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:31,600
next it disconnects the link list
 

3785
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,310
next it disconnects the link list
possibly temporarily right and so

3786
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
possibly temporarily right and so
 

3787
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,149
possibly temporarily right and so
therefore it still works out

3788
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:36,159
therefore it still works out
 

3789
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,550
therefore it still works out
well we have to relink everything to

3790
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:38,560
well we have to relink everything to
 

3791
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,470
well we have to relink everything to
make sure it's temporary

3792
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:40,480
make sure it's temporary
 

3793
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,750
make sure it's temporary
right if we i mean it's very possible

3794
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
right if we i mean it's very possible
 

3795
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,430
right if we i mean it's very possible
when you're dealing with linked data

3796
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:45,440
when you're dealing with linked data
 

3797
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,390
when you're dealing with linked data
structures

3798
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400
structures
 

3799
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,310
structures
to unlink something and not have a

3800
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:48,320
to unlink something and not have a
 

3801
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,990
to unlink something and not have a
reference back to it and

3802
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:50,000
reference back to it and
 

3803
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,470
reference back to it and
now this thing is in memory that your

3804
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:52,480
now this thing is in memory that your
 

3805
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,070
now this thing is in memory that your
garbage collector hopefully will

3806
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:54,080
garbage collector hopefully will
 

3807
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,149
garbage collector hopefully will
pick up but if you're writing in a

3808
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:56,159
pick up but if you're writing in a
 

3809
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,070
pick up but if you're writing in a
language that's not garbage collected

3810
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,080
language that's not garbage collected
 

3811
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,110
language that's not garbage collected
then that's called the memory leak right

3812
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:01,120
then that's called the memory leak right
 

3813
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,390
then that's called the memory leak right
that's no good okay so

3814
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
that's no good okay so
 

3815
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:10,870
that's no good okay so
how do i relink these things

3816
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
how do i relink these things
 

3817
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,709
how do i relink these things
right this is the picture that i have

3818
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:12,719
right this is the picture that i have
 

3819
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,550
right this is the picture that i have
right now how do i make this into a

3820
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
right now how do i make this into a
 

3821
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,550
right now how do i make this into a
linked list where

3822
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
linked list where
 

3823
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:25,990
linked list where
it's here and then reversed

3824
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,000

 

3825
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,550

yeah so i replace this pointer from a to

3826
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:28,560
yeah so i replace this pointer from a to
 

3827
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,189
yeah so i replace this pointer from a to
b

3828
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:29,199
b
 

3829
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:31,910
b
to make it point to c instead and then

3830
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:31,920
to make it point to c instead and then
 

3831
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,669
to make it point to c instead and then
whatever my pointer is to b

3832
01:15:33,669 --> 01:15:33,679
whatever my pointer is to b
 

3833
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,830
whatever my pointer is to b
from b b is reversed right it's pointing

3834
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:35,840
from b b is reversed right it's pointing
 

3835
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,149
from b b is reversed right it's pointing
to a let's set that equal to none

3836
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:38,159
to a let's set that equal to none
 

3837
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:44,950
to a let's set that equal to none
right so basically the last step here is

3838
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:44,960

 

3839
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,470

clean up ends all right

3840
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:48,480
clean up ends all right
 

3841
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,229
clean up ends all right
and in a latex write-up

3842
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
and in a latex write-up
 

3843
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:55,430
and in a latex write-up
right you'd want to specify what are the

3844
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:55,440
right you'd want to specify what are the
 

3845
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,350
right you'd want to specify what are the
things that you're re-linking okay

3846
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,360
things that you're re-linking okay
 

3847
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,990
things that you're re-linking okay
but this was a coding question and so we

3848
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,000
but this was a coding question and so we
 

3849
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,070
but this was a coding question and so we
actually gave you code to work with

3850
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,080
actually gave you code to work with
 

3851
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,510
actually gave you code to work with
okay so i'm going to see

3852
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
okay so i'm going to see
 

3853
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,470
okay so i'm going to see
whether i can live code this for you in

3854
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:08,480
whether i can live code this for you in
 

3855
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:13,669
whether i can live code this for you in
front of you

3856
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:13,679

 

3857
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,430

okay so here was uh

3858
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:17,440
okay so here was uh
 

3859
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,990
okay so here was uh
our code submission site from last term

3860
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,000
our code submission site from last term
 

3861
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,030
our code submission site from last term
okay

3862
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:21,040
okay
 

3863
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,590
okay
and what i have here is my template from

3864
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:23,600
and what i have here is my template from
 

3865
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,310
and what i have here is my template from
last term

3866
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:24,320
last term
 

3867
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,350
last term
pset one it opens this folder okay it's

3868
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
pset one it opens this folder okay it's
 

3869
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,950
pset one it opens this folder okay it's
got a bunch of things in it

3870
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:28,960
got a bunch of things in it
 

3871
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,270
got a bunch of things in it
the template the latex template that you

3872
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
the template the latex template that you
 

3873
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,229
the template the latex template that you
have

3874
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:32,239
have
 

3875
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,310
have
and then a bunch of these python files

3876
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
and then a bunch of these python files
 

3877
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,990
and then a bunch of these python files
okay so i'm gonna

3878
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,000
okay so i'm gonna
 

3879
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,430
okay so i'm gonna
uh where is it here okay so these are

3880
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:39,440
uh where is it here okay so these are
 

3881
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,510
uh where is it here okay so these are
the files that are in my directory

3882
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
the files that are in my directory
 

3883
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,990
the files that are in my directory
i've given you a version of this linked

3884
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:44,000
i've given you a version of this linked
 

3885
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,270
i've given you a version of this linked
list sequence

3886
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280
list sequence
 

3887
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,870
list sequence
uh and then we have two more code

3888
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:46,880
uh and then we have two more code
 

3889
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,030
uh and then we have two more code
questions a test file and a reorder

3890
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,040
questions a test file and a reorder
 

3891
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,470
questions a test file and a reorder
student's file right

3892
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:50,480
student's file right
 

3893
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,189
student's file right
so reorder students look something like

3894
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:53,199
so reorder students look something like
 

3895
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,229
so reorder students look something like
this

3896
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
this
 

3897
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,950
this
okay it has a template of the code that

3898
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:56,960
okay it has a template of the code that
 

3899
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,310
okay it has a template of the code that
we're going to want you to write with

3900
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:58,320
we're going to want you to write with
 

3901
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,229
we're going to want you to write with
inputs and outputs and you're putting

3902
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239
inputs and outputs and you're putting
 

3903
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,149
inputs and outputs and you're putting
your code here right and

3904
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:02,159
your code here right and
 

3905
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,430
your code here right and
this function doesn't need to return

3906
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:03,440
this function doesn't need to return
 

3907
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,350
this function doesn't need to return
anything all right and then

3908
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
anything all right and then
 

3909
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,189
anything all right and then
we also give you this link list

3910
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:07,199
we also give you this link list
 

3911
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,870
we also give you this link list
implementation which is what's in your

3912
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:08,880
implementation which is what's in your
 

3913
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,990
implementation which is what's in your
recitation

3914
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
recitation
 

3915
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,470
recitation
handout right i'm actually going to

3916
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
handout right i'm actually going to
 

3917
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,070
handout right i'm actually going to
ignore most of this stuff

3918
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:14,080
ignore most of this stuff
 

3919
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,950
ignore most of this stuff
really just that this thing contains a

3920
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:16,960
really just that this thing contains a
 

3921
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,669
really just that this thing contains a
item in

3922
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:17,679
item in
 

3923
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,229
item in
next in your node i'm not actually going

3924
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
next in your node i'm not actually going
 

3925
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,910
next in your node i'm not actually going
to look at the items at all

3926
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
to look at the items at all
 

3927
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,310
to look at the items at all
and a head and size in my linked list at

3928
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
and a head and size in my linked list at
 

3929
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,350
and a head and size in my linked list at
the top level

3930
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
the top level
 

3931
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,189
the top level
okay but this is just to kind of tell

3932
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199
okay but this is just to kind of tell
 

3933
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,550
okay but this is just to kind of tell
you what's in there

3934
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:28,560
you what's in there
 

3935
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,110
you what's in there
right so that's what's going to be input

3936
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,120
right so that's what's going to be input
 

3937
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:31,910
right so that's what's going to be input
to my thing

3938
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:31,920
to my thing
 

3939
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,270
to my thing
and if i go here and i run

3940
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
and if i go here and i run
 

3941
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,229
and if i go here and i run
the tests document that you gave me it

3942
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:38,239
the tests document that you gave me it
 

3943
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:40,149
the tests document that you gave me it
fails because i don't have anything

3944
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:40,159
fails because i don't have anything
 

3945
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:43,189
fails because i don't have anything
it didn't do anything to the list okay

3946
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:43,199
it didn't do anything to the list okay
 

3947
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:46,229
it didn't do anything to the list okay
right uh and in fact if i go into here

3948
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
right uh and in fact if i go into here
 

3949
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,270
right uh and in fact if i go into here
to the tests

3950
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,280
to the tests
 

3951
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,310
to the tests
and uh you know

3952
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,320
and uh you know
 

3953
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,830
and uh you know
i uh what is it it's reordering the

3954
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:53,840
i uh what is it it's reordering the
 

3955
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,590
i uh what is it it's reordering the
students here i print the

3956
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,600
students here i print the
 

3957
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,709
students here i print the
the linked list that you gave me i'm

3958
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
the linked list that you gave me i'm
 

3959
01:17:58,719 --> 01:17:59,830
the linked list that you gave me i'm
going to

3960
01:17:59,830 --> 01:17:59,840
going to
 

3961
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,750
going to
have a line break here what we can see

3962
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:03,760
have a line break here what we can see
 

3963
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,870
have a line break here what we can see
is

3964
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:06,880

 

3965
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,750

when i do this okay here are my test

3966
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
when i do this okay here are my test
 

3967
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,550
when i do this okay here are my test
cases

3968
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:10,560
cases
 

3969
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,189
cases
here's a linked list right and what's

3970
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
here's a linked list right and what's
 

3971
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,630
here's a linked list right and what's
happening is it's just spitting out the

3972
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:14,640
happening is it's just spitting out the
 

3973
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,070
happening is it's just spitting out the
same linked lists right i haven't done

3974
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,080
same linked lists right i haven't done
 

3975
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,350
same linked lists right i haven't done
anything to it

3976
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:17,360
anything to it
 

3977
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,910
anything to it
right all right so we need to do

3978
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:19,920
right all right so we need to do
 

3979
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,950
right all right so we need to do
something to it

3980
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:20,960
something to it
 

3981
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,189
something to it
how are we going to do that all right so

3982
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:23,199
how are we going to do that all right so
 

3983
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,110
how are we going to do that all right so
let's let's implement this function and

3984
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:25,120
let's let's implement this function and
 

3985
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:25,990
let's let's implement this function and
i'm going to get rid of this

3986
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
i'm going to get rid of this
 

3987
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,750
i'm going to get rid of this
stuff because get rid of that all right

3988
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:29,760
stuff because get rid of that all right
 

3989
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,350
stuff because get rid of that all right
so we need to reorder this student so

3990
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:31,360
so we need to reorder this student so
 

3991
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,550
so we need to reorder this student so
i'm going to break this under the three

3992
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:32,560
i'm going to break this under the three
 

3993
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,669
i'm going to break this under the three
parts that we have here

3994
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
parts that we have here
 

3995
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,630
parts that we have here
we're going to find the nth node so how

3996
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
we're going to find the nth node so how
 

3997
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,310
we're going to find the nth node so how
do we find the nth node

3998
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,320
do we find the nth node
 

3999
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,189
do we find the nth node
well we have a saw this thing has a size

4000
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:41,199
well we have a saw this thing has a size
 

4001
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:41,990
well we have a saw this thing has a size
on it

4002
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
on it
 

4003
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,830
on it
so let's at least figure out what n is

4004
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
so let's at least figure out what n is
 

4005
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,110
so let's at least figure out what n is
right so let's set

4006
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:45,120
right so let's set
 

4007
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,790
right so let's set
n equal to uh i think i can use

4008
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:48,800
n equal to uh i think i can use
 

4009
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,110
n equal to uh i think i can use
length right because i've implemented

4010
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,120
length right because i've implemented
 

4011
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,229
length right because i've implemented
that on my thing and it's going to be

4012
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
that on my thing and it's going to be
 

4013
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,070
that on my thing and it's going to be
whatever the length is over 2 and i'm

4014
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:54,080
whatever the length is over 2 and i'm
 

4015
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,590
whatever the length is over 2 and i'm
defined by the problem statement that

4016
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:55,600
defined by the problem statement that
 

4017
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,350
defined by the problem statement that
i'm only going to have even inputs

4018
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,360
i'm only going to have even inputs
 

4019
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,550
i'm only going to have even inputs
okay and i'm going to set

4020
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:02,560
okay and i'm going to set
 

4021
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,590
okay and i'm going to set
at first my a

4022
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:05,600
at first my a
 

4023
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,550
at first my a
to be the starting place okay i'm going

4024
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:08,560
to be the starting place okay i'm going
 

4025
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,229
to be the starting place okay i'm going
to just have a little temporary variable

4026
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:10,239
to just have a little temporary variable
 

4027
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:11,189
to just have a little temporary variable
that's going to say

4028
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
that's going to say
 

4029
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,870
that's going to say
this is going to be equal to the head of

4030
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:12,880
this is going to be equal to the head of
 

4031
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,470
this is going to be equal to the head of
my list okay

4032
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,480
my list okay
 

4033
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,310
my list okay
and what i'm going to do is what your

4034
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,320
and what i'm going to do is what your
 

4035
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,830
and what i'm going to do is what your
colleague was saying is i'm just going

4036
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:17,840
colleague was saying is i'm just going
 

4037
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,669
colleague was saying is i'm just going
to loop through

4038
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
to loop through
 

4039
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,950
to loop through
end times until i reach the end thing

4040
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:22,960
end times until i reach the end thing
 

4041
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:23,430
end times until i reach the end thing
actually

4042
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
actually
 

4043
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,870
actually
how many times do i have to travel

4044
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:24,880
how many times do i have to travel
 

4045
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,950
how many times do i have to travel
through next pointers to get to

4046
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:26,960
through next pointers to get to
 

4047
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,229
through next pointers to get to
node a and minus 1

4048
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
node a and minus 1
 

4049
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,630
node a and minus 1
actually yeah so this is going to be 4.

4050
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:32,640
actually yeah so this is going to be 4.
 

4051
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,430
actually yeah so this is going to be 4.
i don't care about this loop variable

4052
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:35,440
i don't care about this loop variable
 

4053
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,070
i don't care about this loop variable
so i'm going to just use that n minus 1

4054
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:38,080
so i'm going to just use that n minus 1
 

4055
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:38,709
so i'm going to just use that n minus 1
times

4056
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:38,719
times
 

4057
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,590
times
right what am i going to do i want to

4058
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:41,600
right what am i going to do i want to
 

4059
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,229
right what am i going to do i want to
replace

4060
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:42,239
replace
 

4061
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,630
replace
a with the thing it's pointed to right

4062
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:44,640
a with the thing it's pointed to right
 

4063
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,990
a with the thing it's pointed to right
so i'm going to just walk down this

4064
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:46,000
so i'm going to just walk down this
 

4065
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,310
so i'm going to just walk down this
thing

4066
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:46,320
thing
 

4067
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,990
thing
a equals a dot next

4068
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,000
a equals a dot next
 

4069
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,350
a equals a dot next
okay and now after the end of this loop

4070
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,360
okay and now after the end of this loop
 

4071
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,390
okay and now after the end of this loop
what is a

4072
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400

 

4073
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,830

a is the nth node right i've now

4074
01:19:59,830 --> 01:19:59,840
a is the nth node right i've now
 

4075
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,030
a is the nth node right i've now
made it the nth node fantastic okay so

4076
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:03,040
made it the nth node fantastic okay so
 

4077
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,110
made it the nth node fantastic okay so
and now i'm going to say that b is going

4078
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:05,120
and now i'm going to say that b is going
 

4079
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,149
and now i'm going to say that b is going
to be the next one

4080
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:06,159
to be the next one
 

4081
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:08,149
to be the next one
right i'm just just in terms of my

4082
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:08,159
right i'm just just in terms of my
 

4083
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,149
right i'm just just in terms of my
write-up i labeled these things as a

4084
01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:10,159
write-up i labeled these things as a
 

4085
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,270
write-up i labeled these things as a
and b and c and so in my mind i'm going

4086
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:13,280
and b and c and so in my mind i'm going
 

4087
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,110
and b and c and so in my mind i'm going
to want to use the same kind of

4088
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:15,120
to want to use the same kind of
 

4089
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,189
to want to use the same kind of
notation here so that i can understand

4090
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:17,199
notation here so that i can understand
 

4091
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:18,709
notation here so that i can understand
my code okay so b

4092
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:18,719
my code okay so b
 

4093
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,350
my code okay so b
is going to be the next thing okay

4094
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360

 

4095
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,950

and now in this process as i'm going to

4096
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:24,960
and now in this process as i'm going to
 

4097
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,629
and now in this process as i'm going to
flip things around what i'm going to do

4098
01:20:26,629 --> 01:20:26,639
flip things around what i'm going to do
 

4099
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,310
flip things around what i'm going to do
is i'm going to keep track of three

4100
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:28,320
is i'm going to keep track of three
 

4101
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,270
is i'm going to keep track of three
notes

4102
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280
notes
 

4103
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,910
notes
i'm going to keep track of x which is

4104
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:31,920
i'm going to keep track of x which is
 

4105
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,350
i'm going to keep track of x which is
the node that i'm

4106
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:33,360
the node that i'm
 

4107
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,910
the node that i'm
going to be relinking and what else do i

4108
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
going to be relinking and what else do i
 

4109
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,229
going to be relinking and what else do i
need to keep track of

4110
01:20:40,229 --> 01:20:40,239

 

4111
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,350

if i'm destination yeah where i came

4112
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:43,360
if i'm destination yeah where i came
 

4113
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,950
if i'm destination yeah where i came
from and where i'm going to

4114
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:44,960
from and where i'm going to
 

4115
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,629
from and where i'm going to
right because that's what i'm going to

4116
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:46,639
right because that's what i'm going to
 

4117
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,709
right because that's what i'm going to
need to relink right in particular

4118
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:48,719
need to relink right in particular
 

4119
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,709
need to relink right in particular
i'm going to have someone pointing to me

4120
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:50,719
i'm going to have someone pointing to me
 

4121
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:51,990
i'm going to have someone pointing to me
which i'm going to call

4122
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
which i'm going to call
 

4123
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,350
which i'm going to call
next previous right or

4124
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
next previous right or
 

4125
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,149
next previous right or
no the x previous and the next thing

4126
01:20:58,149 --> 01:20:58,159
no the x previous and the next thing
 

4127
01:20:58,159 --> 01:20:58,950
no the x previous and the next thing
when i'm going

4128
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:58,960
when i'm going
 

4129
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,110
when i'm going
to uh label it it's going to be the next

4130
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:01,120
to uh label it it's going to be the next
 

4131
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,950
to uh label it it's going to be the next
thing all right does that make sense

4132
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:02,960
thing all right does that make sense
 

4133
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,310
thing all right does that make sense
so in in my first situation

4134
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:06,320
so in in my first situation
 

4135
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:10,070
so in in my first situation
i'm my the first thing i need to relink

4136
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
i'm my the first thing i need to relink
 

4137
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,270
i'm my the first thing i need to relink
is b

4138
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:11,280
is b
 

4139
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,350
is b
right so that's going to be my x and the

4140
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
right so that's going to be my x and the
 

4141
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,270
right so that's going to be my x and the
x previous is going to be a

4142
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
x previous is going to be a
 

4143
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,510
x previous is going to be a
does that make sense so i'm going to

4144
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,520
does that make sense so i'm going to
 

4145
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,350
does that make sense so i'm going to
instantiate those two variables

4146
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:19,360
instantiate those two variables
 

4147
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,629
instantiate those two variables
x and xp are going to be

4148
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:22,639
x and xp are going to be
 

4149
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,149
x and xp are going to be
b and a sorry that's

4150
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
b and a sorry that's
 

4151
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,950
b and a sorry that's
right yeah maybe it makes more sense to

4152
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:28,960
right yeah maybe it makes more sense to
 

4153
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,350
right yeah maybe it makes more sense to
have

4154
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,360
have
 

4155
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,709
have
x previous and x equal a b

4156
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
x previous and x equal a b
 

4157
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,189
x previous and x equal a b
all right that's in in the right order

4158
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199
all right that's in in the right order
 

4159
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,229
all right that's in in the right order
all right that's

4160
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
all right that's
 

4161
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,870
all right that's
either way is fine and then i i want to

4162
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
either way is fine and then i i want to
 

4163
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,070
either way is fine and then i i want to
go through a loop this

4164
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,080
go through a loop this
 

4165
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,510
go through a loop this
i'm going to be doing in the loop way

4166
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:41,520
i'm going to be doing in the loop way
 

4167
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,030
i'm going to be doing in the loop way
you can do it a recursive way if you

4168
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,040
you can do it a recursive way if you
 

4169
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:43,910
you can do it a recursive way if you
want

4170
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:43,920
want
 

4171
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,470
want
okay here's a loop way in which i'm just

4172
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:46,480
okay here's a loop way in which i'm just
 

4173
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,390
okay here's a loop way in which i'm just
going to loop through how many times

4174
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:48,400
going to loop through how many times
 

4175
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,030
going to loop through how many times
how many pointers am i going to relink

4176
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
how many pointers am i going to relink
 

4177
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,390
how many pointers am i going to relink
as i go down this thing

4178
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,400

 

4179
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,709

i need to re-link the pointers of all of

4180
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:56,719
i need to re-link the pointers of all of
 

4181
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,510
i need to re-link the pointers of all of
these guys how many are there

4182
01:21:59,510 --> 01:21:59,520
these guys how many are there
 

4183
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,189
these guys how many are there
how many n there are n of them right so

4184
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:03,199
how many n there are n of them right so
 

4185
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:05,510
how many n there are n of them right so
four i don't care about the loop

4186
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
four i don't care about the loop
 

4187
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,070
four i don't care about the loop
variable here either

4188
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
variable here either
 

4189
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,470
variable here either
i'm going to do this n times and what am

4190
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:10,480
i'm going to do this n times and what am
 

4191
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,270
i'm going to do this n times and what am
i going to do

4192
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280
i going to do
 

4193
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,310
i going to do
i'm going to first figure out who my

4194
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:14,320
i'm going to first figure out who my
 

4195
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,750
i'm going to first figure out who my
next guy is

4196
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
next guy is
 

4197
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,669
next guy is
okay i'm going to set xn

4198
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:19,679
okay i'm going to set xn
 

4199
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:22,709
okay i'm going to set xn
equals what x dot next all right so now

4200
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:22,719
equals what x dot next all right so now
 

4201
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:23,510
equals what x dot next all right so now
i know

4202
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:23,520
i know
 

4203
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,550
i know
who's next to me right so i can

4204
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:26,560
who's next to me right so i can
 

4205
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,950
who's next to me right so i can
go there later after i relink my pointer

4206
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:28,960
go there later after i relink my pointer
 

4207
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,550
go there later after i relink my pointer
i'm remembering that

4208
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:30,560
i'm remembering that
 

4209
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,149
i'm remembering that
okay now i i

4210
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:34,159
okay now i i
 

4211
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,550
okay now i i
don't care about what's stored in x dot

4212
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:36,560
don't care about what's stored in x dot
 

4213
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,110
don't care about what's stored in x dot
next because i've stored it locally

4214
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:39,120
next because i've stored it locally
 

4215
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,990
next because i've stored it locally
right that makes sense all right so now

4216
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
right that makes sense all right so now
 

4217
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,470
right that makes sense all right so now
i

4218
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480
i
 

4219
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,350
i
am free to re-link that next pointer to

4220
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:45,360
am free to re-link that next pointer to
 

4221
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,790
am free to re-link that next pointer to
my previous guy

4222
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:48,800

 

4223
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,629

all right and now i can

4224
01:22:52,629 --> 01:22:52,639
all right and now i can
 

4225
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:56,709
all right and now i can
essentially shift my perspective over

4226
01:22:56,709 --> 01:22:56,719
essentially shift my perspective over
 

4227
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,430
essentially shift my perspective over
so the thing that i'm going to relink

4228
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,440
so the thing that i'm going to relink
 

4229
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,790
so the thing that i'm going to relink
now is the next one

4230
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:00,800
now is the next one
 

4231
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,830
now is the next one
okay so uh x

4232
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:03,840
okay so uh x
 

4233
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,950
okay so uh x
previous and x now

4234
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:06,960
previous and x now
 

4235
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,750
previous and x now
equals x x next does that make sense

4236
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:11,760
equals x x next does that make sense
 

4237
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,950
equals x x next does that make sense
just re-linked things over okay

4238
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:14,960
just re-linked things over okay
 

4239
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,669
just re-linked things over okay
so that's the end of step two now as i

4240
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:17,679
so that's the end of step two now as i
 

4241
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:18,149
so that's the end of step two now as i
all

4242
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:18,159
all
 

4243
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,669
all
as i got down this at the end of this

4244
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:19,679
as i got down this at the end of this
 

4245
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:25,189
as i got down this at the end of this
for loop where is x

4246
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:25,199

 

4247
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:29,110

what is x p x and x next or x n

4248
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,120
what is x p x and x next or x n
 

4249
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,910
what is x p x and x next or x n
really i'm only keeping track of x and x

4250
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:31,920
really i'm only keeping track of x and x
 

4251
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:32,229
really i'm only keeping track of x and x
p

4252
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239
p
 

4253
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,189
p
here right so what are x p and x at the

4254
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
here right so what are x p and x at the
 

4255
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:39,510
here right so what are x p and x at the
end of this loop

4256
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:39,520

 

4257
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,950

i've done this n times i started

4258
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
i've done this n times i started
 

4259
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:49,830
i've done this n times i started
with b at x right

4260
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
with b at x right
 

4261
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,750
with b at x right
so what is x yeah

4262
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:53,760

 

4263
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:59,430

so we have a vote that x is c okay

4264
01:23:59,430 --> 01:23:59,440

 

4265
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,750

so this is a little interesting all

4266
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:01,760
so this is a little interesting all
 

4267
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,390
so this is a little interesting all
right i agree i will tell you that c

4268
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:04,400
right i agree i will tell you that c
 

4269
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:08,229
right i agree i will tell you that c
is either xp x or xn

4270
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
is either xp x or xn
 

4271
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,709
is either xp x or xn
okay so we have one vote for x who says

4272
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:10,719
okay so we have one vote for x who says
 

4273
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:16,709
okay so we have one vote for x who says
something else

4274
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719
something else
 

4275
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,950
something else
eric doesn't like x

4276
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:20,960

 

4277
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,149

so any there are only two other choices

4278
01:24:24,149 --> 01:24:24,159
so any there are only two other choices
 

4279
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,350
so any there are only two other choices
just someone say something

4280
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:27,360

 

4281
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,470

xp well i will argue that it is xp

4282
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
xp well i will argue that it is xp
 

4283
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,750
xp well i will argue that it is xp
all right why because i'm at b

4284
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,760
all right why because i'm at b
 

4285
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,709
all right why because i'm at b
there are eight n things i did n

4286
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:36,719
there are eight n things i did n
 

4287
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,070
there are eight n things i did n
operations

4288
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080
operations
 

4289
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,070
operations
right and every operation i move one

4290
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,080
right and every operation i move one
 

4291
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,510
right and every operation i move one
over right

4292
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,520
over right
 

4293
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,070
over right
so when i've done n minus 1 things i'm

4294
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:44,080
so when i've done n minus 1 things i'm
 

4295
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,189
so when i've done n minus 1 things i'm
at c

4296
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:45,199
at c
 

4297
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:47,350
at c
the nth one now x is none because

4298
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:47,360
the nth one now x is none because
 

4299
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,629
the nth one now x is none because
there's no pointer at the end of the

4300
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
there's no pointer at the end of the
 

4301
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,430
there's no pointer at the end of the
list

4302
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:49,440
list
 

4303
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,790
list
so xp is c so i'm going to set

4304
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:52,800
so xp is c so i'm going to set
 

4305
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,229
so xp is c so i'm going to set
p equal to xp which is it's just for me

4306
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:56,239
p equal to xp which is it's just for me
 

4307
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,229
p equal to xp which is it's just for me
to remember what these things are

4308
01:24:58,229 --> 01:24:58,239
to remember what these things are
 

4309
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,310
to remember what these things are
and i just re-link these two pointers

4310
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:00,320
and i just re-link these two pointers
 

4311
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,350
and i just re-link these two pointers
right a dot next

4312
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:03,360
right a dot next
 

4313
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,709
right a dot next
should be c and b

4314
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:06,719
should be c and b
 

4315
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:10,830
should be c and b
dot next should be none

4316
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:10,840

 

4317
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,830

right does that make sense everybody

4318
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:13,840
right does that make sense everybody
 

4319
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,910
right does that make sense everybody
let's see if we did it right so we saved

4320
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
let's see if we did it right so we saved
 

4321
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,510
let's see if we did it right so we saved
that thing

4322
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:17,520
that thing
 

4323
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,550
that thing
and we run python

4324
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:20,560
and we run python
 

4325
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,669
and we run python
on the test cases and it did the right

4326
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:23,679
on the test cases and it did the right
 

4327
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:24,709
on the test cases and it did the right
thing apparently

4328
