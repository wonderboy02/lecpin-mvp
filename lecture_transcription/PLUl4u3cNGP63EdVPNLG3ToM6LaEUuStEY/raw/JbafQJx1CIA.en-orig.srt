00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
and i want to be sure to leave so the
 

189
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,949
and i want to be sure to leave so the

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
the line and i want to make sure to
 

197
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,990

so p i'm just going to call this segment

202
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
so p i'm just going to call this segment
 

203
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,949
so p i'm just going to call this segment
up front and then i'm going to have

204
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
up front and then i'm going to have
 

205
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,069
up front and then i'm going to have
a bigger thing for

206
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
a bigger thing for
 

207
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,229
a bigger thing for

209
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,189

so this is just to say that p is nested

210
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
so this is just to say that p is nested
 

211
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,150
so this is just to say that p is nested

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,749
problem a lot of basically all the
problems i'll talk about today

346
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
problems i'll talk about today
 

347
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,430
problems i'll talk about today
are decision problems like we talked

348
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
are decision problems like we talked
 

349
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,270
are decision problems like we talked
about last class meaning the answer is

350
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
about last class meaning the answer is
 

351
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,710
about last class meaning the answer is
just yes or no

352
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
just yes or no
 

353
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,309
just yes or no
can white win from this position yes or

354
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
can white win from this position yes or
 

355
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,029
can white win from this position yes or
no is there a negative white cycle yes

356
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
no is there a negative white cycle yes
 

357
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,990
no is there a negative white cycle yes
or no

358
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
or no
 

359
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,710
or no
tetris we can also formulate as a

360
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
tetris we can also formulate as a
 

361
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,790
tetris we can also formulate as a
problem

362
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
problem
 

363
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,629
problem
this is a version of tetris that we

364
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
this is a version of tetris that we
 

365
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,230
this is a version of tetris that we
might call perfect information

366
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
might call perfect information
 

367
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,990
might call perfect information
perfect information tetris suppose i

368
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
perfect information tetris suppose i
 

369
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,990
perfect information tetris suppose i
give you a tetris board

370
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
give you a tetris board
 

371
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,029
give you a tetris board
it has you know some garbage left over

372
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
it has you know some garbage left over
 

373
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,629
it has you know some garbage left over
from your past playing or maybe it

374
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
from your past playing or maybe it
 

375
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,230
from your past playing or maybe it
started that way and i give you the

376
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
started that way and i give you the
 

377
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,029
started that way and i give you the
sequence of

00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
sequence of
 

379
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,629
sequence of
end pieces that are going to come and i

end pieces that are going to come and i
 

381
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,870
end pieces that are going to come and i
want to know can i survive this sequence

382
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
want to know can i survive this sequence
 

383
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,830
want to know can i survive this sequence
of end pieces

384
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
of end pieces
 

385
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,830
of end pieces
can you place each of these pieces as

386
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
can you place each of these pieces as
 

387
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,350
can you place each of these pieces as
they fall

388
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
they fall
 

389
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,230
they fall
such that you never overflow the top of

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
such that you never overflow the top of
 

391
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,510
such that you never overflow the top of
the board

392
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
the board
 

393
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,950
the board
on an n by n board this problem can be

394
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
on an n by n board this problem can be
 

395
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,430
on an n by n board this problem can be
solved

396
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
solved
 

397
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,390
solved
in exponential time but we don't know

398
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
in exponential time but we don't know
 

399
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,670
in exponential time but we don't know
whether it can be solved

400
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
whether it can be solved
 

401
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,990
whether it can be solved
in polynomial time

402
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000

 

403
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,350

uh we will talk about that more in a

404
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
uh we will talk about that more in a
 

405
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,430
uh we will talk about that more in a
moment it's a problem that

406
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
moment it's a problem that
 

407
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,309
moment it's a problem that
very likely is not in p but we can't

408
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
very likely is not in p but we can't
 

409
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,029
very likely is not in p but we can't
actually prove it yet

410
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
actually prove it yet
 

411
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,749
actually prove it yet
all right uh so there's one other class

412
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
all right uh so there's one other class
 

413
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,110
all right uh so there's one other class
i want to define at this point and we'll

414
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
i want to define at this point and we'll
 

415
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,070
i want to define at this point and we'll
get to a

416
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
get to a
 

417
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,189
get to a
fourth one also but r

418
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
fourth one also but r
 

419
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,670
fourth one also but r
is the class of all problems that can be

420
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
is the class of all problems that can be
 

421
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,469
is the class of all problems that can be
solved in

422
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
solved in
 

423
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:23,510
solved in
finite time r stands for finite

424
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520

 

425
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,670

r stands for recursive actually this is

426
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
r stands for recursive actually this is
 

427
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,950
r stands for recursive actually this is
a notion by church

428
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
a notion by church
 

429
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,510
a notion by church
way back in the foundations of computing

430
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
way back in the foundations of computing
 

431
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,469
way back in the foundations of computing
as we know we need

432
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
as we know we need
 

433
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,070
as we know we need
we write recursive algorithms to solve

434
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
we write recursive algorithms to solve
 

435
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,269
we write recursive algorithms to solve
problems in the beginning that was the

436
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
problems in the beginning that was the
 

437
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,709
problems in the beginning that was the
only way to do it now we have other ways

438
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
only way to do it now we have other ways
 

439
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,389
only way to do it now we have other ways
with loops but they're all effectively

440
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
with loops but they're all effectively
 

441
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,029
with loops but they're all effectively
recursion in the end so r is all the

442
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
recursion in the end so r is all the
 

443
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,990
recursion in the end so r is all the
problems that can be

444
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
problems that can be
 

445
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,949
problems that can be
solved in finite time on any computer uh

446
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
solved in finite time on any computer uh
 

447
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,870
solved in finite time on any computer uh
so very general this should include

448
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
so very general this should include
 

449
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,269
so very general this should include
include everything we care about right

450
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
include everything we care about right
 

451
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,870
include everything we care about right
and it's bigger than x it includes

452
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
and it's bigger than x it includes
 

453
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,790
and it's bigger than x it includes
problems that take doubly exponential

454
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
problems that take doubly exponential
 

455
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,590
problems that take doubly exponential
time or whatever uh

456
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
time or whatever uh
 

457
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,710
time or whatever uh
so i will draw a

458
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720

 

459
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,269

region for r so everything includes p it

460
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
region for r so everything includes p it
 

461
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,870
region for r so everything includes p it
includes x

462
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
includes x
 

463
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,509
includes x
and so we also have containment but not

464
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
and so we also have containment but not
 

465
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,829
and so we also have containment but not
equal

466
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
equal
 

467
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,110
equal
r there's of course many classes in

468
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
r there's of course many classes in
 

469
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,990
r there's of course many classes in
between

470
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
between
 

471
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,829
between
you could talk about problems that take

472
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
you could talk about problems that take
 

473
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,430
you could talk about problems that take
double a exponential time and that would

474
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
double a exponential time and that would
 

475
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,110
double a exponential time and that would
have a thing in between here

476
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
have a thing in between here
 

477
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,430
have a thing in between here
or there's also between p and x there's

478
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
or there's also between p and x there's
 

479
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,790
or there's also between p and x there's
a lot of different things

480
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
a lot of different things
 

481
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,070
a lot of different things
we will talk about one of them but

482
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
we will talk about one of them but
 

483
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,829
we will talk about one of them but
before we get to

484
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
before we get to
 

485
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,070
before we get to
the finer side of things let me talk in

486
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
the finer side of things let me talk in
 

487
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,949
the finer side of things let me talk in
particular about

488
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
particular about
 

489
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,710
particular about
r so we have a nice example

490
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
r so we have a nice example
 

491
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,070
r so we have a nice example
we being computational uh complexity

492
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
we being computational uh complexity
 

493
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,509
we being computational uh complexity
theory or i guess it's usually

494
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
theory or i guess it's usually
 

495
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,070
theory or i guess it's usually
just called theoretical computer science

496
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
just called theoretical computer science
 

497
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,150
just called theoretical computer science
has a problem

498
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
has a problem
 

499
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,509
has a problem
and if you're interested in this you can

500
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
and if you're interested in this you can
 

501
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,790
and if you're interested in this you can
take

502
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:43,800

 

503
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,470

604

504
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480

 

505
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,829

one i think no that doesn't sound right

506
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
one i think no that doesn't sound right
 

507
00:09:51,839 --> 00:10:02,389
one i think no that doesn't sound right
that's probability it'll come to me

508
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399

 

509
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,030

we have an explicit problem that is not

510
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
we have an explicit problem that is not
 

511
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,269
we have an explicit problem that is not
in r

512
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
in r
 

513
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,550
in r
so this class has been all about

514
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
so this class has been all about
 

515
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,310
so this class has been all about
problems that are in p do you have the

516
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
problems that are in p do you have the
 

517
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,790
problems that are in p do you have the
number

518
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
number
 

519
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,389
number
604 604 5. thank you so close to this

520
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
604 604 5. thank you so close to this
 

521
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,870
604 604 5. thank you so close to this
this class or it's so close to 6046

522
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
this class or it's so close to 6046
 

523
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,430
this class or it's so close to 6046
which is this

524
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
which is this
 

525
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,230
which is this
natural successor to this class so 6045

526
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
natural successor to this class so 6045
 

527
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,829
natural successor to this class so 6045
would talk about this

528
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839

 

529
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,750

so this class is all about problems that

530
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
so this class is all about problems that
 

531
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,509
so this class is all about problems that
are in p which is very easy

532
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
are in p which is very easy
 

533
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,190
are in p which is very easy
but in fact there are problems way out

534
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
but in fact there are problems way out
 

535
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,710
but in fact there are problems way out
here beyond r

536
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720

 

537
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,829

and here is one such problem

538
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
and here is one such problem
 

539
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,990
and here is one such problem
which we won't prove here today it takes

540
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
which we won't prove here today it takes
 

541
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,269
which we won't prove here today it takes
a whole lecture to prove this

542
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279

 

543
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,069

given a computer program

544
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079

 

545
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:58,949

does it ever halt

546
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959

 

547
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,269

does it ever terminate this would be a

548
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
does it ever terminate this would be a
 

549
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,710
does it ever terminate this would be a
great thing if we knew how to solve it's

550
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
great thing if we knew how to solve it's
 

551
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,710
great thing if we knew how to solve it's
basically an infinite loop detector

552
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
basically an infinite loop detector
 

553
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,310
basically an infinite loop detector
if your problem doesn't halt then it has

554
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
if your problem doesn't halt then it has
 

555
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,829
if your problem doesn't halt then it has
an infinite loop of some sort

556
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
an infinite loop of some sort
 

557
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,230
an infinite loop of some sort
and you'd like to tell your user hey you

558
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
and you'd like to tell your user hey you
 

559
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,590
and you'd like to tell your user hey you
have a bug in your program

560
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
have a bug in your program
 

561
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,910
have a bug in your program
so this is one part of bug detection and

562
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
so this is one part of bug detection and
 

563
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,269
so this is one part of bug detection and
it's impossible there is

564
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
it's impossible there is
 

565
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,990
it's impossible there is
no algorithm that always saw that solves

566
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
no algorithm that always saw that solves
 

567
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,670
no algorithm that always saw that solves
all inputs to this problem

568
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
all inputs to this problem
 

569
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,990
all inputs to this problem
maybe given one program let's say has

570
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
maybe given one program let's say has
 

571
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,110
maybe given one program let's say has
zero lines of code

572
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
zero lines of code
 

573
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,389
zero lines of code
it could solve that it says yeah that

574
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
it could solve that it says yeah that
 

575
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,030
it could solve that it says yeah that
one terminates and maybe you can detect

576
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
one terminates and maybe you can detect
 

577
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,630
one terminates and maybe you can detect
simple kinds of infinite loops

578
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
simple kinds of infinite loops
 

579
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,470
simple kinds of infinite loops
so there's some inputs some computer

580
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
so there's some inputs some computer
 

581
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,829
so there's some inputs some computer
programs that you could detect

582
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
programs that you could detect
 

583
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,630
programs that you could detect
but there's no one algorithm that solves

584
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
but there's no one algorithm that solves
 

585
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,110
but there's no one algorithm that solves
all

586
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
all
 

587
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,509
all
inputs so this is kind of sad news

588
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
inputs so this is kind of sad news
 

589
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,389
inputs so this is kind of sad news
we call such problems uncomputable this

590
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
we call such problems uncomputable this
 

591
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,590
we call such problems uncomputable this
is just another word for

592
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600

 

593
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,430

being not in r

594
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440

 

595
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,710

okay and next thing i'd like to do is

596
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
okay and next thing i'd like to do is
 

597
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,990
okay and next thing i'd like to do is
prove to you that most decision problems

598
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
prove to you that most decision problems
 

599
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,430
prove to you that most decision problems
are uncomputable

600
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
are uncomputable
 

601
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:08,629
are uncomputable
or sketcher proof

602
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639

 

603
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,310

so remember decision problems are

604
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
so remember decision problems are
 

605
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,829
so remember decision problems are
problems where the answer is just yes or

606
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
problems where the answer is just yes or
 

607
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:12,710
problems where the answer is just yes or
no

608
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
no
 

609
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,550
no
this is a very special kind of problem

610
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560

 

611
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,310

and even those almost all of them

612
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
and even those almost all of them
 

613
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,190
and even those almost all of them
cannot be solved so halting is an

614
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
cannot be solved so halting is an
 

615
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,790
cannot be solved so halting is an
example of a problem we want

616
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
example of a problem we want
 

617
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,230
example of a problem we want
uh we can't solve this whole class 006

618
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
uh we can't solve this whole class 006
 

619
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,430
uh we can't solve this whole class 006
is about problems we can solve but today

620
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
is about problems we can solve but today
 

621
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,389
is about problems we can solve but today
i'm going to show you that actually

622
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
i'm going to show you that actually
 

623
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,389
i'm going to show you that actually
those are in the minority most problems

624
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
those are in the minority most problems
 

625
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,629
those are in the minority most problems
cannot be computed this is very strange

626
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
cannot be computed this is very strange
 

627
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,670
cannot be computed this is very strange
and also a little depressing

628
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
and also a little depressing
 

629
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,030
and also a little depressing
so we'll talk more about that in a

630
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
so we'll talk more about that in a
 

631
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,629
so we'll talk more about that in a
moment first let me argue why this is

632
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
moment first let me argue why this is
 

633
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,670
moment first let me argue why this is
the case

634
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
the case
 

635
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,069
the case
so we i'm going to be a little informal

636
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
so we i'm going to be a little informal
 

637
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,110
so we i'm going to be a little informal
about what is

638
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
about what is
 

639
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,750
about what is
what exactly is a computer program and

640
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
what exactly is a computer program and
 

641
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,670
what exactly is a computer program and
what exactly is a decision problem

642
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
what exactly is a decision problem
 

643
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,670
what exactly is a decision problem
but roughly all i need to do

644
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
but roughly all i need to do
 

645
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,110
but roughly all i need to do
the only level of precision i need is

646
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
the only level of precision i need is
 

647
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,590
the only level of precision i need is
just to count how many are there

648
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
just to count how many are there
 

649
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,590
just to count how many are there
what is a computer program well it's

650
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
what is a computer program well it's
 

651
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,710
what is a computer program well it's
usually a file

652
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
usually a file
 

653
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,310
usually a file
well it's a file it's like a string of

654
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
well it's a file it's like a string of
 

655
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,069
well it's a file it's like a string of
characters what's a character

656
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
characters what's a character
 

657
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,550
characters what's a character
it's a string of bits so a program is

658
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
it's a string of bits so a program is
 

659
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,230
it's a string of bits so a program is
just in the end a string of bits

660
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
just in the end a string of bits
 

661
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,069
just in the end a string of bits
finite string of bits

662
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079

 

663
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,590

we all understand that whatever language

664
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
we all understand that whatever language
 

665
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,389
we all understand that whatever language
you define

666
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399

 

667
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,230

in the end your every program is just a

668
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
in the end your every program is just a
 

669
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,150
in the end your every program is just a
string of bits

670
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
string of bits
 

671
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,750
string of bits
and a string of bits we can translate

672
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
and a string of bits we can translate
 

673
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,910
and a string of bits we can translate
into a number

674
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
into a number
 

675
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,310
into a number
so we can convert between strings of

676
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
so we can convert between strings of
 

677
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,110
so we can convert between strings of
bits

678
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
bits
 

679
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,509
bits
and numbers when i say number i mean

680
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
and numbers when i say number i mean
 

681
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,509
and numbers when i say number i mean
what's usually called a natural number

682
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
what's usually called a natural number
 

683
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,030
what's usually called a natural number

blackboard bold ant capital n so this is

692
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
blackboard bold ant capital n so this is
 

693
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,110
blackboard bold ant capital n so this is
just

694
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
just
 

695
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,189
just
you know zero one two and so on

696
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199

 

697
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:10,710

okay now what about decision problems

698
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720

 

699
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,750

decision problem is a specification of

700
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
decision problem is a specification of
 

701
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,430
decision problem is a specification of
what we want to solve so we can think of

702
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
what we want to solve so we can think of
 

703
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,150
what we want to solve so we can think of
it as saying

704
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
it as saying
 

705
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,110
it as saying
for every input is the answer yes or no

706
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
for every input is the answer yes or no
 

707
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,750
for every input is the answer yes or no
that's

708
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
that's
 

709
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,670
that's
literally what a decision problem is the

710
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
literally what a decision problem is the
 

711
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,750
literally what a decision problem is the
only question is what is an input

712
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
only question is what is an input
 

713
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,189
only question is what is an input
and we've talked about inputs and the

714
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
and we've talked about inputs and the
 

715
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,870
and we've talked about inputs and the
size of inputs and

716
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
size of inputs and
 

717
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,030
size of inputs and
and there's lots of different ways to

718
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
and there's lots of different ways to
 

719
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,030
and there's lots of different ways to
measure them but in the end we can think

720
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
measure them but in the end we can think
 

721
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,030
measure them but in the end we can think
of an input as a string of bits also

722
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
of an input as a string of bits also
 

723
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,590
of an input as a string of bits also
it's just a file so a decision problem

724
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
it's just a file so a decision problem
 

725
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,910
it's just a file so a decision problem
is a function

726
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920

 

727
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,269

from inputs

728
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
from inputs
 

729
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,310
from inputs
to yes or no

730
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320

 

731
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,069

and inputs we're going to say well

732
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
and inputs we're going to say well
 

733
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,750
and inputs we're going to say well
that's uh you know string of bits

734
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
that's uh you know string of bits
 

735
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,790
that's uh you know string of bits
which we can associate

736
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
which we can associate
 

737
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,910
which we can associate
with a number

738
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
with a number
 

739
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,110
with a number
in n so here we can start to tie things

740
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
in n so here we can start to tie things
 

741
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,069
in n so here we can start to tie things
together

742
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079

 

743
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,790

so in other words a program is a finite

744
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
so in other words a program is a finite
 

745
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,069
so in other words a program is a finite
string of bits

746
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
string of bits
 

747
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,110
string of bits
and a problem is in some sense an

748
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
and a problem is in some sense an
 

749
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,829
and a problem is in some sense an
infinite string of bits because there

750
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
infinite string of bits because there
 

751
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,829
infinite string of bits because there
are infinitely many possible inputs

752
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
are infinitely many possible inputs
 

753
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,750
are infinitely many possible inputs
and for each of them we specify yes or

754
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
and for each of them we specify yes or
 

755
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,110
and for each of them we specify yes or
no

756
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
no
 

757
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,189
no
so this is basically

758
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199

 

759
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,870

an infinite

760
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880

 

761
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,910

string of bits

762
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920

 

763
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,629

so we can imagine you know zero one one

764
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
so we can imagine you know zero one one
 

765
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,350
so we can imagine you know zero one one
zero one

766
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
zero one
 

767
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,230
zero one
zero zero zero one one one zero

768
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
zero zero zero one one one zero
 

769
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,509
zero zero zero one one one zero
infinitely

770
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
infinitely
 

771
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,829
infinitely
um just some for every string of bits we

772
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
um just some for every string of bits we
 

773
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,629
um just some for every string of bits we
can say okay

774
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
can say okay
 

775
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,110
can say okay
if your input is the number zero here's

776
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
if your input is the number zero here's
 

777
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,069
if your input is the number zero here's
the answer

778
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
the answer
 

779
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,910
the answer
no if your input is uh the number one

780
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
no if your input is uh the number one
 

781
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,509
no if your input is uh the number one
then the answer is yes if your input is

782
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
then the answer is yes if your input is
 

783
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,430
then the answer is yes if your input is
the number two your answer is yes and so

784
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
the number two your answer is yes and so
 

785
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,069
the number two your answer is yes and so
on

786
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
on
 

787
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,069
on
down this line every infinite string of

or it may seem like not a big deal this

this is an infinite string of bits but

808
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
this is an infinite string of bits but
 

809
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,670
this is an infinite string of bits but
mathematics has well studied this

mathematics has well studied this
 

811
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,949
mathematics has well studied this
problem

812
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
problem
 

813
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,590
problem
and infinite strings of bits there are

814
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
and infinite strings of bits there are
 

815
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,509
and infinite strings of bits there are
very many of them

816
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
very many of them
 

817
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,430
very many of them
uh infinitely many it's not surprising

818
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
uh infinitely many it's not surprising
 

819
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,870
uh infinitely many it's not surprising
they're also infinitely many

820
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
they're also infinitely many
 

821
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,269
they're also infinitely many
integers so that's maybe doesn't seem

822
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
integers so that's maybe doesn't seem
 

823
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,069
integers so that's maybe doesn't seem
that deep

824
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
that deep
 

825
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,069
that deep
but there's a difference

826
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
but there's a difference
 

827
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,269
but there's a difference
in infinitude programs

828
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
in infinitude programs
 

829
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:47,430
in infinitude programs
and integers are countably infinite

830
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440

 

831
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,430

and infinite strings of bits are what's

832
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
and infinite strings of bits are what's
 

833
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,069
and infinite strings of bits are what's
called uncountable

834
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079

 

835
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,150

i think the most intuitive way to see

836
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
i think the most intuitive way to see
 

837
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,110
i think the most intuitive way to see
this is

838
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
this is
 

839
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,150
this is
an infinite string of bits if i put a a

840
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
an infinite string of bits if i put a a
 

841
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,710
an infinite string of bits if i put a a
decimal or a binary point in front

842
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
decimal or a binary point in front
 

843
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,829
decimal or a binary point in front
this encodes a real number between 0 and

844
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
this encodes a real number between 0 and
 

845
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,350
this encodes a real number between 0 and
1.

846
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
1.
 

847
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:16,069
1.
so this is roughly a real number

848
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079

 

849
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,549

in 0 1 and when i'm writing

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,069
in 0 1 and when i'm writing
approximately equal here this really

852
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
approximately equal here this really
 

853
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,590
approximately equal here this really

of bits

858
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
of bits
 

859
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,350
of bits
of course giving me the answer for all

860
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
of course giving me the answer for all
 

861
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,949
of course giving me the answer for all
inputs and i can convert that into a

862
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
inputs and i can convert that into a
 

863
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,230
inputs and i can convert that into a
real number between zero and one but

864
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
real number between zero and one but
 

865
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,750
real number between zero and one but
also the other direction if i take any

866
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
also the other direction if i take any
 

867
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,950
also the other direction if i take any
real number

868
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
real number
 

869
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,870
real number
that is a corresponding decision problem

870
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
that is a corresponding decision problem
 

871
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,470
that is a corresponding decision problem
these are one to one

872
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
these are one to one
 

873
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,270
these are one to one
bijection between them and the bad news

874
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
bijection between them and the bad news
 

875
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,590
bijection between them and the bad news
is real numbers are uncountable

876
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
is real numbers are uncountable
 

877
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,230
is real numbers are uncountable
and natural numbers are countable which

878
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
and natural numbers are countable which
 

879
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,950
and natural numbers are countable which
means

880
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
means
 

881
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,590
means
there's a lot more of these than there

882
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
there's a lot more of these than there
 

883
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,590
there's a lot more of these than there
are these

884
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
are these
 

885
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,270
are these
so one may way you might phrase this

886
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
so one may way you might phrase this
 

887
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,029
so one may way you might phrase this
is informally

888
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039
is informally
 

889
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,789
is informally
is the number of natural numbers is way

890
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
is the number of natural numbers is way
 

891
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,190
is the number of natural numbers is way
smaller than the number of real numbers

892
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
smaller than the number of real numbers
 

893
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,630
smaller than the number of real numbers
and so from that

894
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640

 

895
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,390

we derive that most problems are

896
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
we derive that most problems are
 

897
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,830
we derive that most problems are
unsolvable because

898
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
unsolvable because
 

899
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,430
unsolvable because
every program solves exactly one

900
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
every program solves exactly one
 

901
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,110
every program solves exactly one
decision problem we can also

902
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
decision problem we can also
 

903
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,789
decision problem we can also
run a program conceptually on all

904
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
run a program conceptually on all
 

905
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,630
run a program conceptually on all
possible inputs and we will figure out

906
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
possible inputs and we will figure out
 

907
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,070
possible inputs and we will figure out
what function it's solving

908
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
what function it's solving
 

909
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,990
what function it's solving
and if we don't allow random numbers in

910
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
and if we don't allow random numbers in
 

911
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,990
and if we don't allow random numbers in
our program which i'm not here

912
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
our program which i'm not here
 

913
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,110
our program which i'm not here
then every program solves exactly one

914
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
then every program solves exactly one
 

915
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,990
then every program solves exactly one
decision problem

916
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000

917
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,909

possibly it's even worse for us because

918
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
possibly it's even worse for us because
 

919
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,909
possibly it's even worse for us because
multiple programs probably solve the

920
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
multiple programs probably solve the
 

921
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,029
multiple programs probably solve the
same decision problem

922
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
same decision problem
 

923
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,710
same decision problem
they're just they add irrelevant lines

they're just they add irrelevant lines
 

925
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,830
they're just they add irrelevant lines
of code or they don't do anything

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,390

or you know you run bellman ford versus

930
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
or you know you run bellman ford versus
 

931
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,630
or you know you run bellman ford versus
running bellman ford five times

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
running bellman ford five times
 

933
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,990
running bellman ford five times
you'll get the same result and that's

934
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
you'll get the same result and that's
 

935
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,669
you'll get the same result and that's
actually the bad direction for us we'd

936
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
actually the bad direction for us we'd
 

937
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,029
actually the bad direction for us we'd
like to know whether there is a

938
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
like to know whether there is a
 

939
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,710
like to know whether there is a
program that solves every decision

940
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
program that solves every decision
 

941
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,070
program that solves every decision
problem

942
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
problem
 

943
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,110
problem
and because there are only this many

944
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
and because there are only this many
 

945
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,350
and because there are only this many
programs and this many decision problems

946
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
programs and this many decision problems
 

947
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,830
programs and this many decision problems
it just there aren't enough to go around

948
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
it just there aren't enough to go around
 

949
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,350
it just there aren't enough to go around
so most

950
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
so most
 

951
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,390
so most
what's the phrasing not nearly enough

952
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,400
what's the phrasing not nearly enough
 

953
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,669
what's the phrasing not nearly enough
programs for all problems

954
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
programs for all problems
 

955
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:12,870
programs for all problems
and so there's no assignment

956
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880

 

957
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,950

of programs

959
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,190

problems because there's just too many

960
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
problems because there's just too many
 

961
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,470

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,750

more money more problems i guess um

964
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
more money more problems i guess um
 

965
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,830
more money more problems i guess um
so when i first saw this result i was

966
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:27,840
so when i first saw this result i was
 

967
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,669
so when i first saw this result i was
shocked and dismayed that

968
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
shocked and dismayed that
 

969
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,029
shocked and dismayed that
why are we even doing computer science

970
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
why are we even doing computer science
 

971
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,710
why are we even doing computer science
if most problems can't be solved

972
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
if most problems can't be solved
 

973
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,070
if most problems can't be solved
luckily it seems like most of the

974
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
luckily it seems like most of the
 

975
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,150
luckily it seems like most of the
problems we care about can be solved

976
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
problems we care about can be solved
 

977
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,990
problems we care about can be solved
that's what this class is all about and

978
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
that's what this class is all about and
 

979
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,510
that's what this class is all about and
in fact even the problems that seem

980
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
in fact even the problems that seem
 

981
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,830
in fact even the problems that seem
really really hard for us to solve

982
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
really really hard for us to solve
 

983
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,750
really really hard for us to solve
like n by n chess where we can prove it

984
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
like n by n chess where we can prove it
 

985
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,029
like n by n chess where we can prove it
takes exponential time

986
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
takes exponential time
 

987
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,549
takes exponential time
there is an algorithm to solve chess

988
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
there is an algorithm to solve chess
 

989
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,470
there is an algorithm to solve chess
it's just really slow

990
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
it's just really slow
 

991
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,150
it's just really slow
this is a statement about most problems

992
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
this is a statement about most problems
 

993
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,909
this is a statement about most problems
can't even be solved in finite time no

994
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:51,919
can't even be solved in finite time no
 

995
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,789
can't even be solved in finite time no
matter how much time you give them

996
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
matter how much time you give them
 

997
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,830
matter how much time you give them
so it's not all bad

998
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
so it's not all bad
 

999
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,110
so it's not all bad
sort of luckily

1000

this is sort of a mystery of life but
 

1009
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,990
this is sort of a mystery of life but
it's good news or it's why

1010

and it's hard uh i think

1028
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440

 

1029
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,590

i don't have a great reason why i wish i

1030
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
i don't have a great reason why i wish i
 

1031
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,430
i don't have a great reason why i wish i
understood uh is there's a general

1032
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
understood uh is there's a general
 

1033
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,029
understood uh is there's a general
result that if you have any question

1034
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
result that if you have any question
 

1035
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,870
result that if you have any question
about a program itself

1036
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
about a program itself
 

1037
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,630
about a program itself
then there's no algorithm to solve it

1038
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
then there's no algorithm to solve it
 

1039
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,310
then there's no algorithm to solve it
basically any non-trivial question about

1040
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
basically any non-trivial question about
 

1041
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,750
basically any non-trivial question about
programs is heart

1042
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
programs is heart
 

1043
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,029
programs is heart
uh it's not in our and i guess if you

1044
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
uh it's not in our and i guess if you
 

1045
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,070
uh it's not in our and i guess if you
took

1046
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
took
 

1047
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,149
took
i mean if you imagine taking a random

1048
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
i mean if you imagine taking a random
 

1049
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,909
i mean if you imagine taking a random
statement of a problem then maybe this

1050
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
statement of a problem then maybe this
 

1051
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,110
statement of a problem then maybe this
will be in the middle of it with some

1052
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
will be in the middle of it with some
 

1053
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,310
will be in the middle of it with some
probability

1054
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
probability
 

1055
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,390
probability
uh maybe that's why most but this is a

1056
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
uh maybe that's why most but this is a
 

1057
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,470
uh maybe that's why most but this is a
very strong notion of most there are so

1058
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
very strong notion of most there are so
 

1059
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,990
very strong notion of most there are so
many more real numbers than natural

1060
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000

1061
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,110

1062
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120

 

1063
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,190

all right i want to add one more class

1064
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200

i'd like to

i'd like to
make a guess and what that meant in

make a guess and what that meant in

make a guess and what that meant in
terms of a real algorithm is we tried

1148
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
terms of a real algorithm is we tried
 

1149
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,390
terms of a real algorithm is we tried
all the possibilities and then took the

1150
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
all the possibilities and then took the
 

1151
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,070
all the possibilities and then took the
max or the or or whatever

always makes the right guess and whereas
 

1183
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,750
always makes the right guess and whereas
in dp we had to try all the options and

1194
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
this
 

1195
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,310
this
is is called a non-deterministic model

1196
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
is is called a non-deterministic model
 

1197
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:02,230
is is called a non-deterministic model
of computation

1198
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240

 

1199
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,789

and this n is the the n in

1200
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
and this n is the the n in
 

1201
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,029
and this n is the the n in
non-determinism is the n for np so this

1202
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,039
non-determinism is the n for np so this
 

1203
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,149
non-determinism is the n for np so this
is non-deterministic polynomial time

1204
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
is non-deterministic polynomial time
 

1205
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,630
is non-deterministic polynomial time
uh so algorithm

1206
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640

 

1207
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,510

can make guesses

1208
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520

 

1209
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,029

and then in the end it should output

1210
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
and then in the end it should output
 

1211
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:33,110
and then in the end it should output
yes or no

1212
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
yes or no
 

1213
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,029
yes or no
so like say if you're exploring a maze

1214
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
so like say if you're exploring a maze
 

1215
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,390
so like say if you're exploring a maze
this algorithm could say

1216
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
this algorithm could say
 

1217
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,310
this algorithm could say
uh should i go left or go right i'm

1218
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
uh should i go left or go right i'm
 

1219
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,830
uh should i go left or go right i'm
going to guess whether to go left or go

1220
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
going to guess whether to go left or go
 

1221
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,390
going to guess whether to go left or go
right

1222
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,400
right
 

1223
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,149
right
and let's say it guesses left and so

1224
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
and let's say it guesses left and so
 

1225
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,909
and let's say it guesses left and so
then it just goes left and then it

1226
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
then it just goes left and then it
 

1227
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,510
then it just goes left and then it
reaches another junction and says should

1228
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
reaches another junction and says should
 

1229
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,990
reaches another junction and says should
i go left

1230
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
i go left
 

1231
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,750
i go left
or right and i'll say i'll guess and

1232
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
or right and i'll say i'll guess and
 

1233
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,510
or right and i'll say i'll guess and
let's say i guess right this time

1234
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
let's say i guess right this time
 

1235
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,990
let's say i guess right this time
and in the end if i get to some dead end

1236
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
and in the end if i get to some dead end
 

1237
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,269
and in the end if i get to some dead end
maybe and i say no

1238
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
maybe and i say no
 

1239
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,789
maybe and i say no
or if i get to the destination i'm

1240
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
or if i get to the destination i'm
 

1241
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,549
or if i get to the destination i'm
trying to get to i say yes so that's a

1242
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
trying to get to i say yes so that's a
 

1243
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,549
trying to get to i say yes so that's a
non-deterministic algorithm

1244
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
non-deterministic algorithm
 

1245
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,870
non-deterministic algorithm
and what happened what does it mean to

1246
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
and what happened what does it mean to
 

1247
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,390
and what happened what does it mean to
run that algorithm

1248
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
run that algorithm
 

1249
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,750
run that algorithm
what does it mean for the guesses to be

1250
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
what does it mean for the guesses to be
 

1251
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,990
what does it mean for the guesses to be
lucky

1252
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
lucky
 

1253
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,350
lucky
here's what it means these guesses

1254
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
here's what it means these guesses
 

1255
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,149
here's what it means these guesses
are guaranteed which way you end up

1256
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
are guaranteed which way you end up
 

1257
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,190
are guaranteed which way you end up
going

1258
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200

is guaranteed to lead you to a yes if

1260
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
is guaranteed to lead you to a yes if
 

1261
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:25,990
is guaranteed to lead you to a yes if
there is one

1262
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000

 

1263
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,149

if possible so in my maze analogy

1264
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:30,159
if possible so in my maze analogy
 

1265
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,950
if possible so in my maze analogy
if it is if my destination is reachable

1266
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
if it is if my destination is reachable
 

1267
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,230
if it is if my destination is reachable
from my source

1268
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
from my source
 

1269
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,230
from my source
then i'm guaranteed whenever i guess

1270
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
then i'm guaranteed whenever i guess
 

1271
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,310
then i'm guaranteed whenever i guess
left or right uh

1272
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
left or right uh
 

1273
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,950
left or right uh
i will choose a path that leads me to my

1274
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
i will choose a path that leads me to my
 

1275

destination
 

1277
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,990
destination
whereas if the destination is in some

1278
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000
whereas if the destination is in some
 

1279
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,990

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,000
disconnected part of the maze
 

1281
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,390
disconnected part of the maze
and i can't get there then i don't know

1282
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
and i can't get there then i don't know
 

1283
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,750
and i can't get there then i don't know
what the guesses do it doesn't really

1284
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
what the guesses do it doesn't really
 

1285
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,269
what the guesses do it doesn't really
matter because no matter what i do i'll

1286
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
matter because no matter what i do i'll
 

1287
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,750
matter because no matter what i do i'll
end up in a dead end and say no

1288
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
end up in a dead end and say no
 

1289
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,630
end up in a dead end and say no
okay that's the that's the model as long

1290
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
okay that's the that's the model as long
 

1291
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,750
okay that's the that's the model as long
as you have an algorithm that always

1292
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
as you have an algorithm that always
 

1293
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,350
as you have an algorithm that always
outputs yes or no

1294
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
outputs yes or no
 

1295
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,510
outputs yes or no
uh in polynomial time because we're only

1296
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
uh in polynomial time because we're only
 

1297
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,870
uh in polynomial time because we're only
talking about polynomial time lucky

1298
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:02,880
talking about polynomial time lucky
 

1299
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,990
talking about polynomial time lucky
algorithms

1300
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
algorithms
 

1301
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,310
algorithms
uh if there's any way to get to a yes

1302
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
uh if there's any way to get to a yes
 

1303
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,190
uh if there's any way to get to a yes
then

1304
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,200
then
 

1305
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,070
then
your machine will magically find it

1306
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
your machine will magically find it
 

1307
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,830
your machine will magically find it
without having to spend any time to make

1308
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:11,840
without having to spend any time to make
 

1309
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,190
without having to spend any time to make
these decisions

1310
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
these decisions
 

1311
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,390
these decisions
so it's pretty magical computer and it's

1312
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
so it's pretty magical computer and it's
 

1313
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,470
so it's pretty magical computer and it's
not a computer that exists in real life

1314
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
not a computer that exists in real life
 

1315
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,630
not a computer that exists in real life
but it's a computer that's great to

1316
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
but it's a computer that's great to
 

1317
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,470
but it's a computer that's great to
program on it's very powerful

1318
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
program on it's very powerful
 

1319
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,830
program on it's very powerful
you could solve lots of things with it

1320
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
you could solve lots of things with it
 

1321
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,950
you could solve lots of things with it
yeah if you have this magical

1322
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
yeah if you have this magical
 

1323
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,110
yeah if you have this magical
computer you can guess whether it's yes

1324
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
computer you can guess whether it's yes
 

1325
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,950
computer you can guess whether it's yes
or no why doesn't it just

1326
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
or no why doesn't it just
 

1327
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,230
or no why doesn't it just
answer the question right so

1328
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
answer the question right so
 

1329
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,350
answer the question right so
what if we so a nice check is does this

1330
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
what if we so a nice check is does this
 

1331
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,269
what if we so a nice check is does this
make all problems trivial all decision

1332
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
make all problems trivial all decision
 

1333
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:39,830
make all problems trivial all decision
problems

1334
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
problems
 

1335
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,029
problems
maybe i should say well i don't know

1336
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
maybe i should say well i don't know
 

1337
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,390
maybe i should say well i don't know
whether the answer to the problem is yes

1338
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400
whether the answer to the problem is yes
 

1339
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,430
whether the answer to the problem is yes
or no so i'll just guess yes or no

1340
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,440
or no so i'll just guess yes or no
 

1341
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,269
or no so i'll just guess yes or no
this is problematic because

1342
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279

 

1343
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,990

so i might say it will guess a or b and

1344
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
so i might say it will guess a or b and
 

1345
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,870
so i might say it will guess a or b and
if i choose

1346
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
if i choose
 

1347
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,110
if i choose
the a option i will output yes and if i

1348
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
the a option i will output yes and if i
 

1349
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,870
the a option i will output yes and if i
choose the b option i'll output no

1350
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
choose the b option i'll output no
 

1351
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,190
choose the b option i'll output no
in this model that algorithm will always

1352
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
in this model that algorithm will always
 

1353
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,390
in this model that algorithm will always
output yes

1354
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
output yes
 

1355
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,590
output yes
because what it's saying is if there's

1356
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:01,600
because what it's saying is if there's
 

1357
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,590
because what it's saying is if there's
any way to get to a yes answer

1358
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
any way to get to a yes answer
 

1359
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,630
any way to get to a yes answer
i will do that way and so such an

1360
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
i will do that way and so such an
 

1361
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,710
i will do that way and so such an
algorithm that tries to cheat and just

1362
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
algorithm that tries to cheat and just
 

1363
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,990
algorithm that tries to cheat and just
guess the whole answer of the problem

1364
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
guess the whole answer of the problem
 

1365
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,430
guess the whole answer of the problem
will actually end up always saying yes

1366
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
will actually end up always saying yes
 

1367
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,710
will actually end up always saying yes
which means it doesn't solve a very

1368
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:12,720
which means it doesn't solve a very
 

1369
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,789
which means it doesn't solve a very
interesting problem it only solves the

1370
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
interesting problem it only solves the
 

1371
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,390
interesting problem it only solves the
the problem which is represented by the

1372
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
the problem which is represented by the
 

1373
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,070
the problem which is represented by the
bib vector 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.

1374
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
bib vector 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.
 

1375
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,630
bib vector 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.
where all answers are yes but good good

1376
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,640
where all answers are yes but good good
 

1377
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,510
where all answers are yes but good good
check

1378
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
check
 

1379
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,310
check
yeah does there have to be a bound on

1380
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320
yeah does there have to be a bound on
 

1381
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,269
yeah does there have to be a bound on
the number

1382
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:27,279
the number
 

1383
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,830
the number
of things it has to choose between

1384
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:32,840

 

1385
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,870

yes

1386
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
yes
 

1387
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,110
yes
uh exponential number of choices is okay

1388
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,120
uh exponential number of choices is okay
 

1389
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,510
uh exponential number of choices is okay
um i i you i usually like to think of it

1390
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:41,520
um i i you i usually like to think of it
 

1391
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,909
um i i you i usually like to think of it
as you can only guess one bit at a time

1392
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:43,919
as you can only guess one bit at a time
 

1393
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,630
as you can only guess one bit at a time
um but that but we're allowed polynomial

1394
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
um but that but we're allowed polynomial
 

1395
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,990
um but that but we're allowed polynomial
time so if you're actually allowed to

1396
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
time so if you're actually allowed to
 

1397
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,830
time so if you're actually allowed to
guess polynomial number of bits

1398
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
guess polynomial number of bits
 

1399
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,590
guess polynomial number of bits
at that point you can guess over an

1400
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
at that point you can guess over an
 

1401
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,350
at that point you can guess over an
exponential size space but not more than

1402
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,360
exponential size space but not more than
 

1403
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,190
exponential size space but not more than
exponential

1404
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
exponential
 

1405
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,909
exponential
cool so it's it's yeah polynomial time

1406
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
cool so it's it's yeah polynomial time
 

1407
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,190
cool so it's it's yeah polynomial time
let's say in the one bit guessing model

1408
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
let's say in the one bit guessing model
 

1409
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,990
let's say in the one bit guessing model
did i say makes guesses let's let's add

1410
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
did i say makes guesses let's let's add
 

1411
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,350
did i say makes guesses let's let's add
binary here

1412
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360

 

1413
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,350

otherwise we get some other class which

1414
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360
otherwise we get some other class which
 

1415
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,149
otherwise we get some other class which
i don't want

1416
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159

 

1417
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,710

okay let's let's do an example of a real

1418
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
okay let's let's do an example of a real
 

1419
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,310
okay let's let's do an example of a real
example of such an algorithm that's

1420
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
example of such an algorithm that's
 

1421
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,310
example of such an algorithm that's
useful which is tetris

1422
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
useful which is tetris
 

1423
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,789
useful which is tetris
so i claim tetris is in np

1424
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799

 

1425
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,430

because there is a lucky algorithm an

1426
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
because there is a lucky algorithm an
 

1427
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,389
because there is a lucky algorithm an
undeterministic

1428
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
undeterministic
 

1429
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,190
undeterministic
polynomial time algorithm that can solve

1430
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
polynomial time algorithm that can solve
 

1431
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,230
polynomial time algorithm that can solve
the tetris game

1432
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
the tetris game
 

1433
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,389
the tetris game
so again you're given a board you're

1434
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:36,399
so again you're given a board you're
 

1435
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,350
so again you're given a board you're
given some sequence of pieces

1436
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,360
given some sequence of pieces
 

1437
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,190
given some sequence of pieces
and you want to know whether you there's

1438
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
and you want to know whether you there's
 

1439
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,789
and you want to know whether you there's
some way to place the pieces that lets

1440
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
some way to place the pieces that lets
 

1441
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,789
some way to place the pieces that lets
you survive

1442
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
you survive
 

1443
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,269
you survive
and so what i'm going to do is for each

1444
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
and so what i'm going to do is for each
 

1445
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:53,669
and so what i'm going to do is for each
piece

1446
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679

 

1447
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,990

i'm going to guess how to place it

1448
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000

 

1449
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,190

so for the first piece i'm going to

1450
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
so for the first piece i'm going to
 

1451
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,750
so for the first piece i'm going to
guess you know how how far left or right

1452
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760
guess you know how how far left or right
 

1453
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,669
guess you know how how far left or right
do i move it then i let it fall one step

1454
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
do i move it then i let it fall one step
 

1455
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,149
do i move it then i let it fall one step
maybe i rotate it i choose a sequence of

1456
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
maybe i rotate it i choose a sequence of
 

1457
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:08,789
maybe i rotate it i choose a sequence of
moves

1458
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
moves
 

1459
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,029
moves
among left right down rotate right

1460
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
among left right down rotate right
 

1461
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,430
among left right down rotate right
rotate left

1462
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
rotate left
 

1463
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,510
rotate left
and all along the way i make sure i

1464
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
and all along the way i make sure i
 

1465
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,269
and all along the way i make sure i
check is that move valid

1466
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
check is that move valid
 

1467
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,029
check is that move valid
if the move is invalid at any point i

1468
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
if the move is invalid at any point i
 

1469
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,110
if the move is invalid at any point i
just say return no

1470
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
just say return no
 

1471
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,269
just say return no
and then if the piece gets nestled into

1472
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
and then if the piece gets nestled into
 

1473
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,350
and then if the piece gets nestled into
a good spot i continue to the next piece

1474
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
a good spot i continue to the next piece
 

1475
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,630
a good spot i continue to the next piece
i do the same thing guess all the

1476
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
i do the same thing guess all the
 

1477
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,310
i do the same thing guess all the
possible things i could do to that

1478
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
possible things i could do to that
 

1479
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,070
possible things i could do to that
again i only need to guess sort of one

1480
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,080
again i only need to guess sort of one
 

1481
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,590
again i only need to guess sort of one
bit at a time

1482
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:31,600
bit at a time
 

1483
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,110
bit at a time
and i'll only need to do a polynomial

1484
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
and i'll only need to do a polynomial
 

1485
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,789
and i'll only need to do a polynomial
number of guesses like a linear number

1486
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
number of guesses like a linear number
 

1487
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,389
number of guesses like a linear number
of guesses for each piece

1488
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:36,399
of guesses for each piece
 

1489
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,909
of guesses for each piece
about where it falls in so maybe a

1490
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
about where it falls in so maybe a
 

1491
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,470
about where it falls in so maybe a
quadratic number of guesses overall

1492
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
quadratic number of guesses overall
 

1493
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,350
quadratic number of guesses overall
and then at the end if i survived oh i

1494
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
and then at the end if i survived oh i
 

1495
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,110
and then at the end if i survived oh i
also have to check if a line clears

1496
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
also have to check if a line clears
 

1497
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,990
also have to check if a line clears
then i clear the line and if in the end

1498
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
then i clear the line and if in the end
 

1499
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,710
then i clear the line and if in the end
i survive

1500
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
i survive
 

1501
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,630
i survive
i return yes so this is a

1502
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
i return yes so this is a
 

1503
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,669
i return yes so this is a
non-deterministic algorithm

1504
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
non-deterministic algorithm
 

1505
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,070
non-deterministic algorithm
so i would say check the rules of the

1506
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,080
so i would say check the rules of the
 

1507
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,230
so i would say check the rules of the
game

1508
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
game
 

1509
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,190
game
and if we survive

1510
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200

 

1511
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,389

return yes

1512
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399

 

1513
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,510

and if at any point we violate the rules

1514
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
and if at any point we violate the rules
 

1515
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,190
and if at any point we violate the rules
for example we go off the top of the

1516
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
for example we go off the top of the
 

1517
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,149
for example we go off the top of the
board

1518
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:12,159
board
 

1519
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,789
board
we return no so this is an algorithm

1520

people do not
 

1591

1595
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,870

so another definition

1596
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:34,880
so another definition
 

1597
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:58,830
so another definition
is that np is a set of decision problems

1598
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:58,840

 

1599
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,149

you can prove it to me by giving me a

the answer is yes because the verifier

this is a regular

polynomial time in our usual sense it

polynomial time in our usual sense it
 

1785
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,190

will say yes

1786
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
will say yes
 

1787
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,790
will say yes
and furthermore the yes answers from the

1788
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:00,800
and furthermore the yes answers from the
 

1789
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,390
and furthermore the yes answers from the
verifier are actually meaningful

1790
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
verifier are actually meaningful
 

1791
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,990
verifier are actually meaningful
because if i ever give it a no input

1792
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,000
because if i ever give it a no input
 

1793
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,030
because if i ever give it a no input
it always says no no matter what

1794
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,040
it always says no no matter what
 

1795
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:18,470
it always says no no matter what

1797
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,030

so this should really formalize what all

1798
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
so this should really formalize what all
 

1799
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,550
so this should really formalize what all
this means is equivalent to the previous

00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
this means is equivalent to the previous

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,829
this means is equivalent to the previous

1802
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:23,839

1803
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,310
definition
this is saying that proofs exist for yes

1804
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
this is saying that proofs exist for yes
 

1805
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,109
this is saying that proofs exist for yes
instances

1806
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:27,119
instances
 

1807
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,390
instances
and this is saying that proofs don't

1808
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,400
and this is saying that proofs don't
 

1809
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,910
and this is saying that proofs don't
exist for no instances meaning there are

1810
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
exist for no instances meaning there are
 

1811
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,190
exist for no instances meaning there are
no false proofs

1812
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,200
no false proofs
 

1813
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,510
no false proofs
so if the verifier ever outputs yes you

1814
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
so if the verifier ever outputs yes you
 

1815
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,790
so if the verifier ever outputs yes you
know that the answer to your problem is

1816
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
know that the answer to your problem is
 

1817
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,710
know that the answer to your problem is
yes

1818
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:36,720
yes
 

1819
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,230
yes
but if it outputs no you're not sure

1820
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,240
but if it outputs no you're not sure
 

1821
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,990
but if it outputs no you're not sure
maybe you got the certificate wrong

1822
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
maybe you got the certificate wrong
 

1823
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,030
maybe you got the certificate wrong
because we only know there's some

1824
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
because we only know there's some
 

1825
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,390
because we only know there's some
certificate where the verifier will say

1826
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,400
certificate where the verifier will say
 

1827
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,069
certificate where the verifier will say
yes or maybe it was a no input and then

1828
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
yes or maybe it was a no input and then
 

1829
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,430
yes or maybe it was a no input and then
it didn't matter what certificate you

1830
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,440
it didn't matter what certificate you
 

1831
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,470
it didn't matter what certificate you
used

1832
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:46,480
used
 

1833
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,550
used
but it's nice because it says on say

1834
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:48,560
but it's nice because it says on say
 

1835
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,230
but it's nice because it says on say
tetris if i give you the sequence of

1836
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
tetris if i give you the sequence of
 

1837
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,030
tetris if i give you the sequence of
pieces

1838
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
pieces
 

1839
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,470
pieces
it's very easy to write down a verifier

1840
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
it's very easy to write down a verifier
 

1841
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,750
it's very easy to write down a verifier
which just implements the rules of

1842
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
which just implements the rules of
 

1843
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,670
which just implements the rules of
tetris

1844
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
tetris
 

1845
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,030
tetris
and so then you can at least check

1846
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,040
and so then you can at least check
 

1847
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,870
and so then you can at least check
whether a solution is valid

1848
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:58,880
whether a solution is valid
 

1849
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,430
whether a solution is valid
in the yes case in the no case we don't

1850
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,440
in the yes case in the no case we don't
 

1851
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,790
in the yes case in the no case we don't
have anything useful

1852
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:02,800
have anything useful
 

1853
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,069

a lot of the problems that we care about

1862
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
a lot of the problems that we care about
 

1863
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,910
a lot of the problems that we care about
can be phrased as an np

if the answer is yes
 

1875
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,990
if the answer is yes
i can give you a convincing proof why

and it turns out a lot so a lot of

1878
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,280
and it turns out a lot so a lot of
 

1879
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,510
and it turns out a lot so a lot of

because np problems are problems you can

1978
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,520
because np problems are problems you can
 

1979
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,870
because np problems are problems you can
solve by lucky algorithms

1980
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:20,880
solve by lucky algorithms
 

1981
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,589
solve by lucky algorithms
p are problems you can solve by regular

1982
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
p are problems you can solve by regular
 

1983
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,870
p are problems you can solve by regular
old algorithms

1984

old algorithms
 

1985
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,069
old algorithms
and so if p equal to np it means luck

1986
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,079
and so if p equal to np it means luck
 

1987
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,750
and so if p equal to np it means luck

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,950
uh then i can solve the problem that
that's np

that seems super powerful way more

1998
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,200
that seems super powerful way more
 

1999
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,950

let's go over here
 

2027
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,069
let's go over here
the next notion is

2028
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,079

 

2029

2031
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,950

so in particular i want to claim this is

2032
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:30,960
so in particular i want to claim this is
 

2033
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,030
so in particular i want to claim this is
a theorem that exists in the literature

2039
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,309

so i said right here tetris is in x but

2040
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:46,319
so i said right here tetris is in x but
 

2041
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,750
so i said right here tetris is in x but
we don't know whether it's in p

2043
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,990
we don't know whether it's in p
but in fact we conjecture is not in p

2044
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,000
but in fact we conjecture is not in p
 

2045
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,589
but in fact we conjecture is not in p
because we conjecture that p does not

00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
because we conjecture that p does not
 

2047
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:51,990

but this means roughly
 

2083
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,710

problems in np

2186
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
problems in np
 

2187
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,030
problems in np
if there's any problems here in between

in np minus p
 

2191
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,910

then these must be among them and so if

2192
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
then these must be among them and so if
 

2193
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,030
then these must be among them and so if
you assume

2194
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
you assume
 

2195
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,430
you assume
that p is not equal np as most people do

2196
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
that p is not equal np as most people do
 

2197
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,430
that p is not equal np as most people do
then you know that all problems at this

2198
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:05,440
then you know that all problems at this
 

2199
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,349
then you know that all problems at this

the problems in np
 

2203
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,950
the problems in np
they must not be in p and that's why i

2204
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:10,960
they must not be in p and that's why i
 

2205
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,790
they must not be in p and that's why i
can say if p does not equal np

2206
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:12,800
can say if p does not equal np

00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,760
algorithms you just take your problem
 

2227
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,670
algorithms you just take your problem
and we reduce it to a problem you

2228
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
and we reduce it to a problem you
 

2229
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,349
and we reduce it to a problem you
already know how to solve

2230
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:45,359

you take the input

2232
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,200
you take the input
 

2233
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,069
you take the input
to some problem that you want to solve

2234
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
to some problem that you want to solve
 

2235
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,190
to some problem that you want to solve
and you convert it

2236
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,200
and you convert it
 

2237
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,470
and you convert it
into an input to some other problem

2238
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:56,480
into an input to some other problem
 

2239
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,990

so if you have an algorithm that solves

2246
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
so if you have an algorithm that solves
 

2247
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,870
so if you have an algorithm that solves
problem b

2248
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
problem b
 

2249
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,430
problem b
you can convert that into a solution for

2250
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:07,440
you can convert that into a solution for
 

2251
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,670
you can convert that into a solution for
b

2252

2253
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,349

and a reduction should also tell me how

2254
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:11,359
and a reduction should also tell me how
 

2255
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,109
and a reduction should also tell me how
to given a solution to b

2256

didn't know how to solve this you could
 

2311
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,309
didn't know how to solve this you could
solve it by converting it if you've

2312
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
solve it by converting it if you've
 

2313
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,309
solve it by converting it if you've
already written say a dijkstra algorithm

you could
 

2317
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,550
you could
apply it to solve unweighted single

apply it to solve unweighted single
source shortest paths now we know a

2320
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:19,760
source shortest paths now we know a
 

2321
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,030

faster way to solve this

2322
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:21,040
faster way to solve this
 

2323
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,630
faster way to solve this
but you know it's only a log factor

2324
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:22,640
but you know it's only a log factor
 

2325
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,990
but you know it's only a log factor
faster and here we're talking about

2326
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,000
faster and here we're talking about
 

2327
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,069
faster and here we're talking about
polynomial versus exponential

2328

okay so this is a valid reduction it's

2330
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:27,599
okay so this is a valid reduction it's
 

2331
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,950
okay so this is a valid reduction it's

of no weight so that that's

2352
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
of no weight so that that's
 

2353
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,230
of no weight so that that's
maybe a little bit less efficient it

2354
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:52,240
maybe a little bit less efficient it
 

2355
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,670
maybe a little bit less efficient it
depends how what the sum of the weights

2356
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,680

longest path in a graph
 

2363
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,670

00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:03,680
we can weighted path uh we can reduce to
 

2365
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,430
we can weighted path uh we can reduce to
shortest path in a graph

2366
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440
shortest path in a graph
 

2367
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,950
shortest path in a graph
weighted by

00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,040
negating all the weights we did this in
 

2371
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,390

longest path in a dag we can convert

2376
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
longest path in a dag we can convert
 

2377
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,030
longest path in a dag we can convert
that into shortest path and tag just by

that into shortest path and tag just by
 

2379
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,390
that into shortest path and tag just by
negating all the weights so these are

it turns out the same tool of reductions

2394
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:31,920
it turns out the same tool of reductions
 

2395
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,190
it turns out the same tool of reductions
can be used to prove

00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:36,079
negative results too and in this case
 

2399
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:36,790
negative results too and in this case
we're going to

2400
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:36,800
we're going to
 

2401
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,190
we're going to
reduce from a problem that we think

00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,200
reduce from a problem that we think
 

2403

okay so let me write more precisely what

2410
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,520
okay so let me write more precisely what
 

2411
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:47,910
okay so let me write more precisely what
this

2412
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920
this
 

2413
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,750
this
means if you can find a reduction like

2414
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:49,760
means if you can find a reduction like
 

2415
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,870
means if you can find a reduction like
this it means that solving a

2416
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:52,880
this it means that solving a
 

2417
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,030
this it means that solving a
is at least as easy

2418
00:47:59,030 --> 00:47:59,040

 

2419
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,390

as solving b right because

2420
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:02,400
as solving b right because
 

2421
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,309
as solving b right because
i could solve a in particular by

2422
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
i could solve a in particular by
 

2423
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,670
i could solve a in particular by
converting it into b

2424
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
converting it into b
 

2425
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,990
converting it into b
solving b and then converting it back to

2426
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,000
solving b and then converting it back to
 

2427
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,270
solving b and then converting it back to
the solution to a

2428
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
the solution to a
 

2429
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,589
the solution to a
so in other words if i can solve b i can

2430
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
so in other words if i can solve b i can
 

2431
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,870
so in other words if i can solve b i can
solve a which is

2432
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
solve a which is
 

2433
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,950
solve a which is
i can phrase informally as a is at least

2434
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:14,960
i can phrase informally as a is at least
 

2435
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,150
i can phrase informally as a is at least
as easy as b

2436
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,160
as easy as b
 

2437
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,870
as easy as b
and now using uh grammar or

2438
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:18,880
and now using uh grammar or
 

2439
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,309
and now using uh grammar or
contrapositive whatever

2440
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
contrapositive whatever
 

2441
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,710
contrapositive whatever
this is the same thing as saying that b

2442
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
this is the same thing as saying that b
 

2443
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,430
this is the same thing as saying that b
is at least

2444
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:23,440
is at least
 

2445
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:31,990
is at least
as hard as a

2446
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000

 

2447
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,829

and this is what i mean by at least as

2448
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:33,839
and this is what i mean by at least as
 

2449
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,829
and this is what i mean by at least as
hard as so this is my definition of at

2450
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:35,839
hard as so this is my definition of at
 

2451
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,109
hard as so this is my definition of at
least as hard

2452
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:37,119
least as hard
 

2453
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,390
least as hard
in this notion of np hardness

2454
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,400
in this notion of np hardness
 

2455
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,430
in this notion of np hardness
okay so what np hard means is that i'm

2456
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,440
okay so what np hard means is that i'm
 

2457
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,349
okay so what np hard means is that i'm
at least as hard as all problems in np

2458
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:45,359
at least as hard as all problems in np
 

2459
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,990
at least as hard as all problems in np
and so what that means is every problem

2460
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
and so what that means is every problem
 

2461
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,270
and so what that means is every problem
in np

2462
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:49,280
in np
 

2463
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,470
in np
can be reduced to tetris which is kind

2464
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
can be reduced to tetris which is kind
 

2465
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,990
can be reduced to tetris which is kind
of funny

2466
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:54,000
of funny
 

2467
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,349
of funny
but in particular that means that if

2468
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:55,359
but in particular that means that if
 

2469
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,790
but in particular that means that if
there's an algorithm for tetris there's

2470
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
there's an algorithm for tetris there's
 

2471
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,630
there's an algorithm for tetris there's
an algorithm for all problems

2472
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:58,640
an algorithm for all problems
 

2473
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,870
an algorithm for all problems
in np and so that's actually the

2474
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:00,880
in np and so that's actually the
 

2475
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,390
in np and so that's actually the
contrapositive of this statement

2476
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
contrapositive of this statement
 

2477
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,150
contrapositive of this statement
so saying if there's a polynomial if i

2478
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:04,160
so saying if there's a polynomial if i
 

2479
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,589
so saying if there's a polynomial if i
take the contrapositive this this is

2480
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:05,599
take the contrapositive this this is
 

2481
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,030
take the contrapositive this this is
saying if there's a polynomial time

2482
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:07,040
saying if there's a polynomial time
 

2483
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,470
saying if there's a polynomial time
algorithm for tetris

2484
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:08,480
algorithm for tetris
 

2485
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,230
algorithm for tetris
then p equals np there's a polynomial

2486
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:10,240
then p equals np there's a polynomial
 

2487
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,470
then p equals np there's a polynomial
time algorithm for every problem in np

2488
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:12,480
time algorithm for every problem in np
 

2489
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,750
time algorithm for every problem in np
and the way we prove that is by

2490
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
and the way we prove that is by
 

2491
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,069
and the way we prove that is by
reductions we take an arbitrary problem

2492
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:16,079
reductions we take an arbitrary problem
 

2493
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:16,790
reductions we take an arbitrary problem
in np

2494
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:16,800
in np
 

2495
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,270
in np
and we reduce it to tetris luckily

2496
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
and we reduce it to tetris luckily
 

2497
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,430
and we reduce it to tetris luckily
that's not as hard as it sounds because

2498
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:21,440
that's not as hard as it sounds because
 

2499
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,510
that's not as hard as it sounds because
it's already been done once there is

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:23,520
it's already been done once there is
 

2501
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,109
it's already been done once there is
already a reduction from

00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:25,119
already a reduction from
 

2503
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,630
already a reduction from
np to from all problems in np

2504
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
np to from all problems in np
 

2505
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,829
np to from all problems in np
to singular problems out there the mp

complete problems there was some first

2508
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:33,280
complete problems there was some first

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,030

i guess is turing machine

00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
i guess is turing machine

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,870
i guess is turing machine
non-determinant it's basically

2514
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
non-determinant it's basically
 

2515
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,470
non-determinant it's basically
simulating lucky algorithm so it's kind

2516
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
simulating lucky algorithm so it's kind
 

2517
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,309
simulating lucky algorithm so it's kind
of a not very interesting problem

2518
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:42,319
of a not very interesting problem
 

2519
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,069
of a not very interesting problem
but from that problem if you can reduce

2520
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
but from that problem if you can reduce
 

2521
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,510
but from that problem if you can reduce
it to any other problem you know that

2522
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:45,520
it to any other problem you know that
 

2523
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,829
it to any other problem you know that
problem is np-hard as well

2524
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:47,839
problem is np-hard as well
 

2525
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,750
problem is np-hard as well
and so briefly i want to show you some

2526
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:49,760
and so briefly i want to show you some
 

2527
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,670
and so briefly i want to show you some
examples of that

2528
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:53,680

 

2529
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,349

here so

2530
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
here so
 

2531
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,109
here so
i want to start out with a problem that

2532
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
i want to start out with a problem that
 

2533
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,790
i want to start out with a problem that
i'm just going to assume

2534
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800
i'm just going to assume
 

2535
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,190
i'm just going to assume
is mp complete and it's called three

2536
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:03,200
is mp complete and it's called three
 

2537
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,230
is mp complete and it's called three
partition

2538
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,240
partition
 

2539
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,630
partition
um it's one way to phrase it is i give

2540
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:06,640
um it's one way to phrase it is i give
 

2541
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,349
um it's one way to phrase it is i give
you a bunch of

2542
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:07,359
you a bunch of
 

2543
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,589
you a bunch of
integers i think i have it written down

2544
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:09,599
integers i think i have it written down
 

2545
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,390
integers i think i have it written down
over here

2546
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:12,400

 

2547
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,430

also the board i give you n

2548
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
also the board i give you n
 

2549
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,750
also the board i give you n
integers and i'd like to divide them up

2550
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:17,760
integers and i'd like to divide them up
 

2551
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,069
integers and i'd like to divide them up
into n over three groups of size three

2552
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
into n over three groups of size three
 

2553
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,470
into n over three groups of size three
such that each group of size three has

2554
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:22,480
such that each group of size three has
 

2555
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,710
such that each group of size three has
the same sum

2556
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
the same sum
 

2557
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,589
the same sum
uh as it's written up there on the board

2558
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:27,599
uh as it's written up there on the board
 

2559
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,109
uh as it's written up there on the board
uh so you can also think of this as the

2560
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,119
uh so you can also think of this as the
 

2561
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,630
uh so you can also think of this as the
following problem i give you a bunch of

2562
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:30,640
following problem i give you a bunch of
 

2563
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,390
following problem i give you a bunch of
rectangles that are

2564
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,400
rectangles that are
 

2565
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,630
rectangles that are
a side length or a bunch of sticks let's

2566
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:34,640
a side length or a bunch of sticks let's
 

2567
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,790
a side length or a bunch of sticks let's
say of varying lengths

2568
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:36,800
say of varying lengths
 

2569
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,950
say of varying lengths
and i want to group them up like on the

2570
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:38,960
and i want to group them up like on the
 

2571
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,790
and i want to group them up like on the
right diagram

2572
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:40,800
right diagram
 

2573
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,190
right diagram
so that in groups of three such that the

2574
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,200
so that in groups of three such that the
 

2575
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,630
so that in groups of three such that the
total length of each group

2576
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:44,640
total length of each group
 

2577
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,750
total length of each group
is exactly the same okay this is just a

2578
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:47,760
is exactly the same okay this is just a
 

2579
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,390
is exactly the same okay this is just a
problem

2580
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:48,400
problem
 

2581
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,870
problem
and just believe for now that is mp

2582
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:50,880
and just believe for now that is mp
 

2583
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,309
and just believe for now that is mp
complete i won't prove that

2584
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
complete i won't prove that
 

2585
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,630
complete i won't prove that
but i'd like to do what i'd like to show

2586
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:54,640
but i'd like to do what i'd like to show
 

2587
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,109
but i'd like to do what i'd like to show
you is a reduction from this problem

2588
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
you is a reduction from this problem
 

2589
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,750
you is a reduction from this problem
to another problem solving jigsaw

2590
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
to another problem solving jigsaw
 

2591
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,109
to another problem solving jigsaw
puzzles

2592
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:01,119
puzzles
 

2593
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,109
puzzles
uh so you might think jigsaw puzzles are

2594
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:03,119
uh so you might think jigsaw puzzles are
 

2595
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,470
uh so you might think jigsaw puzzles are
really easy

2596
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:04,480
really easy
 

2597
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,870
really easy
and especially easy if i lose the

2598
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:06,880
and especially easy if i lose the
 

2599
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,430
and especially easy if i lose the
projector

2600
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
projector
 

2601
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,430
projector
but in fact if you have a jigsaw puzzle

2602
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,440
but in fact if you have a jigsaw puzzle
 

2603
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,030
but in fact if you have a jigsaw puzzle
where some of the

2604
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,040
where some of the
 

2605
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,790
where some of the
matches are ambiguous if there's

2606
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:14,800
matches are ambiguous if there's
 

2607
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,710
matches are ambiguous if there's
multiple pieces that could fit against a

2608
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:16,720
multiple pieces that could fit against a
 

2609
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,670
multiple pieces that could fit against a
given tab

2610
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:17,680
given tab
 

2611
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,069
given tab
or pocket then i claim i can represent

2612
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
or pocket then i claim i can represent
 

2613
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,710
or pocket then i claim i can represent
this three partition problem by building

2614
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:24,720
this three partition problem by building
 

2615
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,910
this three partition problem by building
little sticks

2616
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920
little sticks
 

2617
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,710
little sticks
like here so if i want to represent a

00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:40,880
i'm going to represent that by about by
 

2631
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,349
i'm going to represent that by about by

given this piece on the left and this

2642
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
given this piece on the left and this
 

2643
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,430
given this piece on the left and this
tab on the right there's a unique pocket

tab on the right there's a unique pocket
 

2645
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,190
tab on the right there's a unique pocket
there's a piece with a unique pocket

2646
00:51:59,190 --> 00:51:59,200
there's a piece with a unique pocket
 

2647
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,190
there's a piece with a unique pocket
that fits perfectly into that piece so

2648
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:01,200
that fits perfectly into that piece so
 

2649
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,589
that fits perfectly into that piece so
this

2650
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:01,599
this
 

2651
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,309
this
this joining is forced and also this

2652
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:04,319
this joining is forced and also this
 

2653
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,349
this joining is forced and also this
joining is forced

2654
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
joining is forced
 

2655
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,950
joining is forced
but the blue tabs and pockets are

2656
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:06,960
but the blue tabs and pockets are
 

2657
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,430
but the blue tabs and pockets are
different they're all the same

2658
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
different they're all the same
 

2659
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,829
different they're all the same
they're all identical and so if i build

2660
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
they're all identical and so if i build
 

2661
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,670
they're all identical and so if i build
this frame

2662

using the you know red unique

2664
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:16,839
using the you know red unique
 

2665
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,990
using the you know red unique
assignments and i build these rectangles

2666
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,000
assignments and i build these rectangles
 

2667
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,990
assignments and i build these rectangles
if i want to pack these rectangles into

2668
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,000
if i want to pack these rectangles into
 

2669
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,910
if i want to pack these rectangles into
this rectangle that's exactly the three

2670
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920

partition problem
 

2673
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,270
partition problem
with some details that i didn't fill in

2674
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,280
with some details that i didn't fill in
 

2675
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,109
with some details that i didn't fill in
but it turns out

2676
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:29,119
but it turns out
 

2677
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,349
but it turns out
you'd be forced to group these into

2678
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:31,359
you'd be forced to group these into
 

2679
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,549
you'd be forced to group these into
groups of size

2680
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:32,559
groups of size
 

2681
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,910
groups of size
three something like this

2682
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920

 

2683
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,030

varying lengths but

2684
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,040

 

2685
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,630

okay so that's an example of reduction

2686
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:40,640
okay so that's an example of reduction
 

2687
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,309
okay so that's an example of reduction
if you believe the three partition is np

2688
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,319
if you believe the three partition is np
 

2689
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,670
if you believe the three partition is np
hard this proves to you

2690
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:43,680
hard this proves to you
 

2691
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,670
hard this proves to you
that jigsaw puzzles are np hard

2692
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
that jigsaw puzzles are np hard
 

2693
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,430
that jigsaw puzzles are np hard
something you may not have none

2694
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:47,440
something you may not have none
 

2695
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,950
something you may not have none
every time you solve a jigsaw puzzle you

2696
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
every time you solve a jigsaw puzzle you
 

2697
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,309
every time you solve a jigsaw puzzle you
can feel good about yourself now

2698
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:50,319
can feel good about yourself now
 

2699
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,790
can feel good about yourself now
especially if it has ambiguous mates

2700
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,800
especially if it has ambiguous mates
 

2701
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,549
especially if it has ambiguous mates
next is tetris so here is a reduction

2702
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:56,559
next is tetris so here is a reduction
 

2703
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,630
next is tetris so here is a reduction
from the same three partition problem

2704
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:58,640
from the same three partition problem
 

2705
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,309
from the same three partition problem
which is one of my favorite problems to

2706
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:00,319
which is one of my favorite problems to
 

2707
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,950
which is one of my favorite problems to
tetris it starts out with this strange

2708
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:02,960
tetris it starts out with this strange
 

2709
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,109
tetris it starts out with this strange
board it has a bunch of

that we want all of the numbers to all

2722
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
that we want all of the numbers to all

00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,109
that we want all of the numbers to all
the triples of numbers to add up to

2724
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:21,119
the triples of numbers to add up to
 

2725
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,510
the triples of numbers to add up to
and there's n over three of these uh

2726
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:23,520
and there's n over three of these uh
 

2727

slots where i can try to put pieces
 

2729
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,549
slots where i can try to put pieces
and it's because of this thing over on

2730
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,559
and it's because of this thing over on
 

2731
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,950

2733
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,470
the right there's no way to clear lines
in this game and now to represent a

2734
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:34,480
in this game and now to represent a
 

2735
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,790
in this game and now to represent a
single number ai i'm going to give you

2736
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:36,800
single number ai i'm going to give you
 

2737
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,950
single number ai i'm going to give you
this sequence of pieces which starts

2738
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:38,960
this sequence of pieces which starts
 

2739
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,309
this sequence of pieces which starts
with an l piece

2740
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
with an l piece
 

2741
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,470
with an l piece
and then it has a i repetitions of this

2742
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,480
and then it has a i repetitions of this
 

2743
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,349
and then it has a i repetitions of this
pattern

2744
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:43,359
pattern
 

2745
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,670
pattern
and then it ends with these two pieces

2746
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
and then it ends with these two pieces
 

2747
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,430
and then it ends with these two pieces
and so what ends up happening

2748
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:47,440
and so what ends up happening
 

2749
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,190
and so what ends up happening
is that this is in the intended solution

2750
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:51,200
is that this is in the intended solution
 

2751
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,829
is that this is in the intended solution
you first place an l at the bottom of

2752
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:53,839
you first place an l at the bottom of
 

2753
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,190
you first place an l at the bottom of
one of these

2754
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,200
one of these
 

2755
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,750
one of these
buckets and then you repeat this pattern

2756
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:57,760
buckets and then you repeat this pattern
 

2757
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,870
buckets and then you repeat this pattern
in this nice way

2758
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:58,880
in this nice way
 

2759
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,910
in this nice way
and it fills up the ai roughly height

2760
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
and it fills up the ai roughly height
 

2761
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,710
and it fills up the ai roughly height
of this bucket and then at the end you

2762
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:04,720
of this bucket and then at the end you
 

2763
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,150
of this bucket and then at the end you
have to put the eye here

2764
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:08,160

 

2765
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,910

and what this guarantee what this ends

2766
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:09,920
and what this guarantee what this ends
 

2767
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,589
and what this guarantee what this ends
up guaranteeing is that all of these

2768
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:11,599
up guaranteeing is that all of these
 

2769
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:12,470
up guaranteeing is that all of these
pieces

2770
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,480
pieces
 

2771
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,470
pieces
go into a single bucket it's um you can

2772
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
go into a single bucket it's um you can
 

2773
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,309
go into a single bucket it's um you can
check it's tedious but

2774
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
check it's tedious but
 

2775
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,230
check it's tedious but
uh if you tried to put some of these

2776
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,240
uh if you tried to put some of these
 

2777
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,990
uh if you tried to put some of these
pieces in one bucket and other pieces in

2778
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,000
pieces in one bucket and other pieces in
 

2779
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,870
pieces in one bucket and other pieces in
a different bucket

2780
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
a different bucket
 

2781
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,510
a different bucket
you would lose some space and then you

2782
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
you would lose some space and then you
 

2783
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,309
you would lose some space and then you
would die

2784
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:24,319
would die
 

2785
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,510
would die
so if you want to survive you have to

2786
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:25,520
so if you want to survive you have to
 

2787
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,950
so if you want to survive you have to
put all these pieces into one bucket and

2788
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:26,960
put all these pieces into one bucket and
 

2789
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,710
put all these pieces into one bucket and
so again we're just stacking rectangles

2790
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:28,720
so again we're just stacking rectangles
 

2791
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,430
so again we're just stacking rectangles
we're putting a whole bunch of

2792
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:29,440
we're putting a whole bunch of
 

2793
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,710
we're putting a whole bunch of
rectangles in one

2794
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:30,720
rectangles in one
 

2795
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,309
rectangles in one
pocket and then a bunch of rectangles in

2796
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
pocket and then a bunch of rectangles in
 

2797
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,829
pocket and then a bunch of rectangles in
another pocket we can switch back and

2798
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
another pocket we can switch back and
 

2799
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,030
another pocket we can switch back and
forth however we want

2800
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:35,040
forth however we want
 

2801
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,270
forth however we want
but the only way to win it turns out is

2802
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,280
but the only way to win it turns out is
 

2803
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,069
but the only way to win it turns out is
if you get all

2804
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
if you get all
 

2805
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,950
if you get all
of those rectangles to add up to exactly

2806
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:40,960
of those rectangles to add up to exactly
 

2807
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,910
of those rectangles to add up to exactly
the right height

2808
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:41,920
the right height
 

2809
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,390
the right height
then you get a picture like this if you

2810
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
then you get a picture like this if you
 

2811
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,829
then you get a picture like this if you
don't get a picture like this you can

2812
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:45,839
don't get a picture like this you can
 

2813
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,510
don't get a picture like this you can
prove you end up dying

2814
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:47,520
prove you end up dying
 

2815
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,430
prove you end up dying
then i'll give you a bunch of l's then

2816
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
then i'll give you a bunch of l's then
 

2817
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,030
then i'll give you a bunch of l's then
i'll finally give you this t which

2818
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,040
i'll finally give you this t which
 

2819
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,150
i'll finally give you this t which
clears some lines

2820
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,160
clears some lines
 

2821
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,510
clears some lines
and then i'll give you it's the most

2822
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:53,520
and then i'll give you it's the most
 

2823
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,030
and then i'll give you it's the most
satisfying tetris game ever i'll give

2824
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,040
satisfying tetris game ever i'll give
 

2825
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,069
satisfying tetris game ever i'll give
you a ton of eyes

2826
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
you a ton of eyes
 

2827
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,990
you a ton of eyes
and you get tetris tetris tetris and you

2828
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
and you get tetris tetris tetris and you
 

2829
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,190
and you get tetris tetris tetris and you
clear the entire board

2830
00:54:59,190 --> 00:54:59,200
clear the entire board
 

2831
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,109
clear the entire board
and so if you can solve the three

2832
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:01,119
and so if you can solve the three
 

2833
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,390
and so if you can solve the three
partition problem you can clear the

2834
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
partition problem you can clear the
 

2835
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,150
partition problem you can clear the
board and win the game and

2836
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
board and win the game and
 

2837
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,270
board and win the game and
be the best tetris player ever and if

2838
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,280
be the best tetris player ever and if
 

2839
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,190
be the best tetris player ever and if
there is no solution to three partition

2840
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:09,200
there is no solution to three partition
 

2841
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,950
there is no solution to three partition
