namely we want to split up our problem
 

67
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,350
namely we want to split up our problem
into multiple sub problems and

then

76
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
then
 

77
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,749

there's few of them there's only a

there's few of them there's only a
 

85
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,630
there's few of them there's only a
linear number of them

86
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
linear number of them
 

87
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,350
linear number of them
in general we want a polynomial number

sometimes you need substrings there's

94
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
sometimes you need substrings there's
 

95
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,870
sometimes you need substrings there's
quadratically many of those

96
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
quadratically many of those

some sub-problem
 

123
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,309
some sub-problem
and you try to ask a question whose

127
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,470

would let you reduce to a smaller

128
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
would let you reduce to a smaller
 

129
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,990
would let you reduce to a smaller

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
only has a polynomial number of answers
 

135
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,430
only has a polynomial number of answers
then boom and you've only got polynomial

136
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
then boom and you've only got polynomial
 

137
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,630
then boom and you've only got polynomial
number of subproblems then you will get

138
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
number of subproblems then you will get
 

139
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,470
number of subproblems then you will get
a polynomial running time

140
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480

so i have i think another way to say

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
so i have i think another way to say
 

143
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,589
so i have i think another way to say
this

144
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
this
 

145
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,910
this
we just locally brute force all possible

146
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
we just locally brute force all possible
 

147
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,030
we just locally brute force all possible
answers to whatever

148
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040

question we come up with as long as

151
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,630
question we come up with as long as
there's polynomially many

152
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
there's polynomially many
 

153
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,070
there's polynomially many
and then each of them is going to

154
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
and then each of them is going to
 

155
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,830
and then each of them is going to
recursively call

156
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
recursively call
 

157
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,470
recursively call
the smaller sub-problems but because we

158
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
the smaller sub-problems but because we
 

159
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,830
the smaller sub-problems but because we
memoize we'll only solve each

160
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
memoize we'll only solve each
 

161
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,949
memoize we'll only solve each
sub-problem once

162
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
sub-problem once
 

163
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,710
sub-problem once
and so in the end the running time will

164
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
and so in the end the running time will
 

165
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,990
and so in the end the running time will
be at most the number

166
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
be at most the number
 

167
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,070
be at most the number
of subproblems times the non-recursive

168
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
of subproblems times the non-recursive
 

169
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,790

for that to work of course the relations

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,710
i have two examples an example here
so for example it could be a sequence of

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
so for example it could be a sequence of

in your sequence or any subset of the
 

281
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,909
in your sequence or any subset of the
items in your sequence so you can have

282
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
items in your sequence so you can have
 

283
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,150

here we have two sequences and so we

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
here we have two sequences and so we
 

347
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,150
here we have two sequences and so we
need a new trick

348
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
need a new trick
 

349
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,550
need a new trick
before we said okay if our sub-problems

350
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
before we said okay if our sub-problems
 

351
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,070
before we said okay if our sub-problems
or sorry if our input consists of a

352
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
or sorry if our input consists of a
 

353
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,590
or sorry if our input consists of a
single sequence we'll try prefixes

354
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
single sequence we'll try prefixes
 

355
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,189
single sequence we'll try prefixes
suffixes or substrings

356
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
suffixes or substrings
 

357
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,110
suffixes or substrings
now we've got two sequences so somehow

358
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
now we've got two sequences so somehow
 

359
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,189
now we've got two sequences so somehow
we need to combine

360
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
we need to combine
 

361
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,950
we need to combine
multiple input

362
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
multiple input
 

363
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,430
multiple input
together and so

364
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
together and so
 

365
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,029
together and so
here's a general trick sub problems

366
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
here's a general trick sub problems
 

367
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,230
here's a general trick sub problems
for multiple

368
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
for multiple
 

369
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,029
for multiple
inputs it's a very simple trick

370
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
inputs it's a very simple trick
 

371
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,070
inputs it's a very simple trick
we just take the

372
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
we just take the
 

373
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,390
we just take the
product multiply

374
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400

 

375
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,029

the sub subproblem spaces

376
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039

 

377
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,110

okay in the sense of cross product of

378
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
okay in the sense of cross product of
 

379
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,629
okay in the sense of cross product of
sets

380
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
sets
 

381
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,390
sets
and in particular from a combinatorial

382
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
and in particular from a combinatorial
 

383
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,230
and in particular from a combinatorial
perspective so we have sort of two

384
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
perspective so we have sort of two
 

385
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,909
perspective so we have sort of two
inputs the first sequence a and the

386
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
inputs the first sequence a and the
 

387
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,070
inputs the first sequence a and the
second sequence b

388
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
second sequence b
 

389
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,430
second sequence b
for each of them there's a natural

390
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
for each of them there's a natural
 

391
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,029
for each of them there's a natural
choice or there's three natural choices

392
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
choice or there's three natural choices
 

393
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,629
choice or there's three natural choices
we could do one of these i will choose

394
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
we could do one of these i will choose
 

395
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,589
we could do one of these i will choose
suffixes for a and suffix is for b you

396
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
suffixes for a and suffix is for b you
 

397
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,550
suffixes for a and suffix is for b you
could do some

398
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
could do some
 

399
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,990
could do some
other combination but that will be

400
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
other combination but that will be
 

401
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,230
other combination but that will be
enough for here and then i want to

402
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
enough for here and then i want to
 

403
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,309
enough for here and then i want to
multiply these spaces meaning

404
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
multiply these spaces meaning
 

405
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,150
multiply these spaces meaning
the number of subproblems is going to be

406
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
the number of subproblems is going to be
 

407
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,070
the number of subproblems is going to be
the product of the number of suffixes

408
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
the product of the number of suffixes
 

409
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,629
the product of the number of suffixes
here

410
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
here
 

411
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,749
here
times the number of suffixes here okay

412
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
times the number of suffixes here okay
 

413
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,710
times the number of suffixes here okay
and in other words every subproblem in

414
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
and in other words every subproblem in
 

415
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,070
and in other words every subproblem in
lcs is going to be

416
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
lcs is going to be
 

417
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,990
lcs is going to be
a pair of suffixes so let me

418
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
a pair of suffixes so let me
 

419
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,350
a pair of suffixes so let me
write that down so for

420
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
write that down so for
 

421
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,110
write that down so for
for lcs

422
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120

 

423
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,309

our subproblems

424
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319

 

425
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,309

are l of i j

426
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
are l of i j
 

427
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,990
are l of i j
this is going to be the longest common

428
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
this is going to be the longest common
 

429
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,510
this is going to be the longest common
subsequence of

430
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
subsequence of
 

431
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,230
subsequence of
the suffix of a starting at i and the

432
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
the suffix of a starting at i and the
 

433
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,110
the suffix of a starting at i and the
suffix of b

434
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
suffix of b
 

435
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,189
suffix of b
starting at j

436
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199

 

437
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,589

and just to be clear how many there are

438
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
and just to be clear how many there are
 

439
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,589
and just to be clear how many there are
i'll give the ranges for i and j

440
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
i'll give the ranges for i and j
 

441
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,190
i'll give the ranges for i and j
i'm not going to assume the sequences

442
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
i'm not going to assume the sequences
 

443
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,790
i'm not going to assume the sequences
are the same length like in the example

444
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
are the same length like in the example
 

445
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,190
are the same length like in the example
so right lengths of a and less than b i

446
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
so right lengths of a and less than b i
 

447
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,949
so right lengths of a and less than b i
like to include the empty suffix

448
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
like to include the empty suffix
 

449
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,350
like to include the empty suffix
so when j equals the length of b that's

450
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
so when j equals the length of b that's
 

451
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,070
so when j equals the length of b that's
a

452
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
a
 

453
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,230
a
zero items in it because that makes for

454
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
zero items in it because that makes for
 

455
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,670
zero items in it because that makes for
really easy base cases

456
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
really easy base cases
 

457
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,030
really easy base cases
so i'd like to include those in my

458
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
so i'd like to include those in my
 

459
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,110
so i'd like to include those in my
sub-problems

460
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
sub-problems
 

461
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,030
sub-problems
so that was the s in sort bot

462
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
so that was the s in sort bot
 

463
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,310
so that was the s in sort bot
now i claim that that set of subproblems

464
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
now i claim that that set of subproblems
 

465
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,829
now i claim that that set of subproblems
is enough to do

466
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
is enough to do
 

467
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,030
is enough to do
a relation

468
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040

 

469
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,590

recursive relation among them so i'd

470
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
recursive relation among them so i'd
 

471
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,310
recursive relation among them so i'd
like to solve

472
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
like to solve
 

473
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,670
like to solve
every subproblem l i j

474
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
every subproblem l i j
 

475
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,269
every subproblem l i j
and uh relation is actually pretty

476
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
and uh relation is actually pretty
 

477
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,550
and uh relation is actually pretty
simple but

478
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
simple but
 

479
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,190
simple but
it's maybe not so obvious so the idea is

480
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
it's maybe not so obvious so the idea is
 

481
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,949
it's maybe not so obvious so the idea is
because we're looking at suffixes we

482
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
because we're looking at suffixes we
 

483
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,949
because we're looking at suffixes we
should always think about what happens

484
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
should always think about what happens
 

485
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,990
should always think about what happens
in the first

486
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
in the first
 

487
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,870
in the first
letter um because if we remove that

488
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
letter um because if we remove that
 

489
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,470
letter um because if we remove that
first letter then we get a smaller

490
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
first letter then we get a smaller
 

491
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,350
first letter then we get a smaller
suffix

492
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
suffix
 

493
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,550
suffix
if you're doing prefixes you should

494
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
if you're doing prefixes you should
 

495
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,070
if you're doing prefixes you should
always look at the last letter either

496
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
always look at the last letter either
 

497
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,790
always look at the last letter either
one would work for this problem

498
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
one would work for this problem
 

499
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,030
one would work for this problem
so we're doing suffixes so we look at a

500
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
so we're doing suffixes so we look at a
 

501
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,910
so we're doing suffixes so we look at a
of i

502
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
of i
 

503
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,150
of i
and we look at b of j

504
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160

 

505
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,030

that's the first letter in in the suffix

506
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
that's the first letter in in the suffix
 

507
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,150
that's the first letter in in the suffix
a starting at i

508
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
a starting at i
 

509
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,190
a starting at i
and the suffix b starting at j

510
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
and the suffix b starting at j
 

511
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,829
and the suffix b starting at j
and there are two cases they could be

512
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839
and there are two cases they could be
 

513
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,190
and there are two cases they could be
equal or

514
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
equal or
 

515
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,829
equal or
different

516
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839

 

517
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,430

i think the easier case to think about

518
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
i think the easier case to think about
 

519
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,269
i think the easier case to think about
is when they're different so

520
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
is when they're different so
 

521
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,310
is when they're different so
like in hieroglyphology and michelangelo

522
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
like in hieroglyphology and michelangelo
 

523
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,310
like in hieroglyphology and michelangelo
if we look at the whole string say the

524
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
if we look at the whole string say the
 

525
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,829
if we look at the whole string say the
first letter in the top one is h

526
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
first letter in the top one is h
 

527
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,750
first letter in the top one is h
the first letter and the second one is m

528
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
the first letter and the second one is m
 

529
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,230
the first letter and the second one is m
those are different letters so clearly

530
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
those are different letters so clearly
 

531
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,030
those are different letters so clearly
the one of those letters is not in the

532
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
the one of those letters is not in the
 

533
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,630
the one of those letters is not in the
common subsequence

534
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
common subsequence
 

535
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,910
common subsequence
because they don't match i can't start

536
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
because they don't match i can't start
 

537
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,910
because they don't match i can't start
with an h i can't well i can start with

538
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
with an h i can't well i can start with
 

539
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,670
with an h i can't well i can start with
an h i could start with an m but i can't

540
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
an h i could start with an m but i can't
 

541
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,470
an h i could start with an m but i can't
start

542
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480

with both one of those letters is not in

544
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
with both one of those letters is not in
 

545
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,630
with both one of those letters is not in
the output in this example

546
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
the output in this example
 

547
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,710
the output in this example
it's m and so but i don't know which one

548
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
it's m and so but i don't know which one
 

549
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,350
it's m and so but i don't know which one
so i have this question i want to

550
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
so i have this question i want to
 

551
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,190
so i have this question i want to
identify some question

552
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
identify some question
 

553
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,550
identify some question
the question is should i do i know that

554
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
the question is should i do i know that
 

555
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,550
the question is should i do i know that
the h is not in the answer or do i know

556
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
the h is not in the answer or do i know
 

557
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,030
the h is not in the answer or do i know
that m

558
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
that m
 

559
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,590
that m
is not in the answer the final final

560
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
is not in the answer the final final
 

561
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,949
is not in the answer the final final
longest common subsequence

562
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
longest common subsequence
 

563
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,030
longest common subsequence
we don't know which so we'll just try

564
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
we don't know which so we'll just try
 

565
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,150
we don't know which so we'll just try
both

566
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
both
 

567
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,550
both
and then we're trying to maximize the

568
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
and then we're trying to maximize the
 

569
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,069
and then we're trying to maximize the
length of our common subsequence so

570
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
length of our common subsequence so
 

571
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,150
length of our common subsequence so
we'll take the max

572
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
we'll take the max
 

573
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,350
we'll take the max
of uh

574
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
of uh
 

575
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,269
of uh
l i plus 1 j

576
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
l i plus 1 j
 

577
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,190
l i plus 1 j
and l i j minus 1.

578
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200

 

579
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,150

so the intuition here is one of

580
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
so the intuition here is one of
 

581
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,030
so the intuition here is one of
at least one of ai and bj

582
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
at least one of ai and bj
 

583
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,550
at least one of ai and bj
is not in the lcs

584
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560

 

585
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,829

uh get this wrong

586
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
uh get this wrong
 

587
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,509
uh get this wrong
plus one sorry

588
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
plus one sorry
 

589
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,110
plus one sorry
thinking about sub strings already yeah

590
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
thinking about sub strings already yeah
 

591
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,470
thinking about sub strings already yeah
these are the beginning points so i want

592
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
these are the beginning points so i want
 

593
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,350
these are the beginning points so i want
to exclude

594
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
to exclude
 

595
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,389
to exclude
the i letter so if if a i is not in

596
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
the i letter so if if a i is not in
 

597
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,509
the i letter so if if a i is not in
then i want to look at the suffix

598
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
then i want to look at the suffix
 

599
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,670
then i want to look at the suffix
starting at i plus one if bj is not in

600
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
starting at i plus one if bj is not in
 

601
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,710
starting at i plus one if bj is not in
then i want to look at the suffix

602
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
then i want to look at the suffix
 

603
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,310
then i want to look at the suffix
starting at j plus 1.

604
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
starting at j plus 1.
 

605
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,230
starting at j plus 1.
so the indices are always increasing in

606
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
so the indices are always increasing in
 

607
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,509
so the indices are always increasing in
the function calls

608
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519

 

609
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,910

and the other case is that they're equal

610
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
and the other case is that they're equal
 

611
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,629
and the other case is that they're equal
so this one

612
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
so this one
 

613
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,190
so this one
i have a little bit harder time arguing

614
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
i have a little bit harder time arguing
 

615
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,470
i have a little bit harder time arguing
i'm going to write the answer and then

616
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
i'm going to write the answer and then
 

617
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,550
i'm going to write the answer and then
prove that the answer is correct

618
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560

 

619
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,629

here i claim you don't need to make any

620
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
here i claim you don't need to make any
 

621
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,590
here i claim you don't need to make any
choices

622
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
choices
 

623
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,910
choices
there's no question you need to answer

624
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
there's no question you need to answer
 

625
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,829
there's no question you need to answer
you can actually guarantee

626
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
you can actually guarantee
 

627
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,870
you can actually guarantee
that ai and bj might as well be

628
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
that ai and bj might as well be
 

629
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,230
that ai and bj might as well be
in the longest common subsequence and so

630
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
in the longest common subsequence and so
 

631
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,389
in the longest common subsequence and so
i get one point for that and then i

632
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
i get one point for that and then i
 

633
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,470
i get one point for that and then i
recurse on all the remaining letters so

634
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
recurse on all the remaining letters so
 

635
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,670
recurse on all the remaining letters so
from i plus one on

636
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
from i plus one on
 

637
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,790
from i plus one on
and from j plus one on why is this okay

638
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
and from j plus one on why is this okay
 

639
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,629
and from j plus one on why is this okay
well we have a b we're starting at

640
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
well we have a b we're starting at
 

641
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,990
well we have a b we're starting at
position i

642
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
position i
 

643
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,030
position i
and starting at position j for b

644
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
and starting at position j for b
 

645
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,629
and starting at position j for b
um and think of some optimal solution

646
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
um and think of some optimal solution
 

647
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,310
um and think of some optimal solution
some longest common subsequence so

648
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
some longest common subsequence so
 

649
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,509
some longest common subsequence so
it pairs up letters in some

650
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
it pairs up letters in some
 

651
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,870
it pairs up letters in some
some way these this would be some

652
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
some way these this would be some
 

653
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,110
some way these this would be some
non-crossing pairing between

654
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
non-crossing pairing between
 

655
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,550
non-crossing pairing between
equal letters uh and

656
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
equal letters uh and
 

657
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,190
equal letters uh and
let's say uh so first case is that maybe

658
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
let's say uh so first case is that maybe
 

659
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,750
let's say uh so first case is that maybe
i and j

660
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
i and j
 

661
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,590
i and j
aren't paired with anything well that's

662
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
aren't paired with anything well that's
 

663
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,870
aren't paired with anything well that's
silly because if they're not paired with

664
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
silly because if they're not paired with
 

665
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,990
silly because if they're not paired with
anything you have some pairing on the

666
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
anything you have some pairing on the
 

667
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,150
anything you have some pairing on the
rest of the items you can add this pair

668
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
rest of the items you can add this pair
 

669
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,670
rest of the items you can add this pair
and that would be a longer subsequent so

670
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
and that would be a longer subsequent so
 

671
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,269
and that would be a longer subsequent so
that would be a contradiction if we're

672
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
that would be a contradiction if we're
 

673
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:13,750
that would be a contradiction if we're
taking

674
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760

00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
one of these with something maybe it
 

681
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,030

well if we have a longest comb sub

684
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
well if we have a longest comb sub
 

685
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,470
well if we have a longest comb sub
sequence that looks like that

686
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
sequence that looks like that
 

687
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,389
sequence that looks like that
i can just instead pair i with bj

688
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
i can just instead pair i with bj
 

689
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,269
i can just instead pair i with bj
that's still uh you know if i had this

690
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
that's still uh you know if i had this
 

691
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,389
that's still uh you know if i had this
pairing

692
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
pairing
 

693
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,910
pairing
i'm actually not using any of these

694
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
i'm actually not using any of these
 

695
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,269
i'm actually not using any of these
letters so why don't i just use this

696
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
letters so why don't i just use this
 

697
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,230
letters so why don't i just use this
letter instead

698
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
letter instead
 

699
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,670
letter instead
so you can argue there is a longest

700
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
so you can argue there is a longest
 

701
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,269
so you can argue there is a longest
common subsequence that matches

702
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
common subsequence that matches
 

703
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,629
common subsequence that matches
ai with bj and so then we can guarantee

704
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
ai with bj and so then we can guarantee
 

705
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,269
ai with bj and so then we can guarantee
by that little proof that we get one

706
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
by that little proof that we get one
 

707
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:47,990
by that little proof that we get one
point for

708
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
point for
 

709
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,230
point for
matching them up and there's no that we

710
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
matching them up and there's no that we
 

711
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,470
matching them up and there's no that we
don't have to max this with anything

712
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
don't have to max this with anything
 

713
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,949
don't have to max this with anything
okay so two cases pretty simple formula

714
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
okay so two cases pretty simple formula
 

715
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,030
okay so two cases pretty simple formula
um and then we're basically done we just

716
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
um and then we're basically done we just
 

717
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,269
um and then we're basically done we just
need to fill in the rest of sort bot

718
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
need to fill in the rest of sort bot
 

719
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:09,110
need to fill in the rest of sort bot
so next is topological order

720
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120

 

721
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:20,389

so this i'll write as for loops

722
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399

 

723
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,910

because i'm dealing with suffixes we

724
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
because i'm dealing with suffixes we
 

725
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,750
because i'm dealing with suffixes we
want to start with the empty suffixes

726
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
want to start with the empty suffixes
 

727
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,110
want to start with the empty suffixes
and then work our way to larger and

728
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
and then work our way to larger and
 

729
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,790
and then work our way to larger and
larger suffixes so this might seem

730
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
larger suffixes so this might seem
 

731
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,310
larger suffixes so this might seem
backwards if you're doing prefixes it

732
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
backwards if you're doing prefixes it
 

733
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,750
backwards if you're doing prefixes it
would be an increasing order

734
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
would be an increasing order
 

735
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,110
would be an increasing order
there's all sorts of orders you could

736
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
there's all sorts of orders you could
 

737
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,269
there's all sorts of orders you could
flip the i and j it's very symmetric so

738
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
flip the i and j it's very symmetric so
 

739
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,470
flip the i and j it's very symmetric so
it doesn't really matter

740
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
it doesn't really matter
 

741
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,470
it doesn't really matter
but anything that's generally decreasing

742
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
but anything that's generally decreasing
 

743
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,590
but anything that's generally decreasing
in inj

744
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
in inj
 

745
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,350
in inj
is good then we have base cases

746
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360

 

747
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,269

uh these are when one of the sequences

748
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
uh these are when one of the sequences
 

749
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,710
uh these are when one of the sequences
is empty

750
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
is empty
 

751
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,790
is empty
i don't care how many items are in b but

752
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
i don't care how many items are in b but
 

753
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,710
i don't care how many items are in b but
if a has no items there's no common

754
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
if a has no items there's no common
 

755
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,990
if a has no items there's no common
subsequence i mean

756
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
subsequence i mean
 

757
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,269
subsequence i mean
it's empty and same for uh

758
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
it's empty and same for uh
 

759
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,949
it's empty and same for uh
no matter how big a is if i've exhausted

760
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
no matter how big a is if i've exhausted
 

761
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,030
no matter how big a is if i've exhausted
the b string i start from beyond the

762
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
the b string i start from beyond the
 

763
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,150
the b string i start from beyond the
last item

764
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
last item
 

765
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,990
last item
then i should get 0. then the original

766
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
then i should get 0. then the original
 

767
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,150
then i should get 0. then the original
problem we want to solve

768
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160

 

769
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,710

is l 0 0 that's just longest common

770
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
is l 0 0 that's just longest common
 

771
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,550
is l 0 0 that's just longest common
subsequence of the entire a and the

772
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
subsequence of the entire a and the
 

773
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,310
subsequence of the entire a and the
entire b

774
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
entire b
 

775
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,470
entire b
and time

776
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480

 

777
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,310

okay so for time we need to know how

778
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
okay so for time we need to know how
 

779
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,949
okay so for time we need to know how
many sub problems there are it's

780
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
many sub problems there are it's
 

781
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,069
many sub problems there are it's
a plus one times b plus one

782
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
a plus one times b plus one
 

783
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,629
a plus one times b plus one
i'll just call that theta a b so these

784
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
i'll just call that theta a b so these
 

785
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,350
i'll just call that theta a b so these
are

786
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
are
 

787
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,629
are
non-empty subsequences so this is the

788
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
non-empty subsequences so this is the
 

789
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,069
non-empty subsequences so this is the
number of sub-problems

790
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
number of sub-problems
 

791
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,230
number of sub-problems
and then what we care about is how much

792
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
and then what we care about is how much
 

793
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,389
and then what we care about is how much
time do we spend for each subproblem in

794
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
time do we spend for each subproblem in
 

795
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,749
time do we spend for each subproblem in
evaluating this

796
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
evaluating this
 

797
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,590
evaluating this
recurrence relation so we ignore the

798
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
recurrence relation so we ignore the
 

799
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,509
recurrence relation so we ignore the
cost to recursively call these l's

800
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
cost to recursively call these l's
 

801
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,230
cost to recursively call these l's
because

802
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
because
 

803
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,509
because
they are smaller sub problems they're

804
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
they are smaller sub problems they're
 

805
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,269
they are smaller sub problems they're
already dealt with when i multiply by

806
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
already dealt with when i multiply by
 

807
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,629
already dealt with when i multiply by
the number of subproblems

808
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
the number of subproblems
 

809
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,470
the number of subproblems
so i just care about this max

810
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
so i just care about this max
 

811
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,710
so i just care about this max
computation and this equality check

812
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
computation and this equality check
 

813
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,870
computation and this equality check
and we'll say those each cost constant

814
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
and we'll say those each cost constant
 

815
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,629
and we'll say those each cost constant
time

816
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
time
 

817
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,670
time
so this is

818
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680

 

819
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,069

quadratic time if the two strings are

820
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
quadratic time if the two strings are
 

821
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,509
quadratic time if the two strings are
size n this is n squared

822
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
size n this is n squared
 

823
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,110
size n this is n squared
general it's the product of the two

824
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
general it's the product of the two
 

825
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,629
general it's the product of the two
string sizes

826
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
string sizes
 

827
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,990
string sizes
and that's longest common substring

828
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
and that's longest common substring
 

829
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,870
and that's longest common substring
so uh pretty straightforward this really

830
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
so uh pretty straightforward this really
 

831
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,150
so uh pretty straightforward this really
doesn't

832
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
doesn't
 

833
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,670
doesn't
other than this little argument and

834
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
other than this little argument and
 

835
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,870
other than this little argument and
understanding the case when they're

836
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
understanding the case when they're
 

837
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,670
understanding the case when they're
equal

838
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
equal
 

839
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,189
equal
the easy case where they're unequal we

840
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
the easy case where they're unequal we
 

841
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,110
the easy case where they're unequal we
just try the only two things we could do

842
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
just try the only two things we could do
 

843
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,069
just try the only two things we could do
one of the

844
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
one of the
 

845
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,189
one of the
uh one of a inbj is not in the longest

846
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
uh one of a inbj is not in the longest
 

847
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,550
uh one of a inbj is not in the longest
common subsequence

848
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
common subsequence
 

849
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,509
common subsequence
so what i like to say is we guess which

850
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
so what i like to say is we guess which
 

851
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,150
so what i like to say is we guess which
of those

852
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
of those
 

853
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,990
of those
is the correct one that is not in the

854
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
is the correct one that is not in the
 

855
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,430
is the correct one that is not in the
longest common subsequence

856
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
longest common subsequence
 

857
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,590
longest common subsequence
and if we guess that it's in a then

858
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
and if we guess that it's in a then
 

859
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,350
and if we guess that it's in a then
we'll recurse on that side if we guess

860
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
we'll recurse on that side if we guess
 

861
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,389
we'll recurse on that side if we guess
that it's in j

862
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
that it's in j
 

863
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,030
that it's in j
then we'll recurse on by increasing j

864
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
then we'll recurse on by increasing j
 

865
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,150
then we'll recurse on by increasing j
and then uh would i'd like to assume

866
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
and then uh would i'd like to assume
 

867
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,069
and then uh would i'd like to assume
not really that we always make the

868
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
not really that we always make the
 

869
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,189
not really that we always make the
correct guess

870
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
correct guess
 

871
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,629
correct guess
that we made the correct choice whether

872
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
that we made the correct choice whether
 

873
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,389
that we made the correct choice whether
it's irj now we don't actually know how

874
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
it's irj now we don't actually know how
 

875
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,310
it's irj now we don't actually know how
to do that so instead we brute force

876
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
to do that so instead we brute force
 

877
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,309
to do that so instead we brute force
we try both of them and then because

878
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
we try both of them and then because
 

879
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,789
we try both of them and then because
we're trying to maximize we take the max

880
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
we're trying to maximize we take the max
 

881
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,390
we're trying to maximize we take the max
okay just another way of thinking about

882
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
okay just another way of thinking about
 

883
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,150
okay just another way of thinking about
it but

884
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
it but
 

885
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,429
it but
overall very straightforward the only

886
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
overall very straightforward the only
 

887
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,350
overall very straightforward the only
com added complication here is we had to

888
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
com added complication here is we had to
 

889
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,630
com added complication here is we had to
deal with two

890
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
deal with two
 

891
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,189
deal with two
uh sequences simultaneously and we just

892
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
uh sequences simultaneously and we just
 

893
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,429
uh sequences simultaneously and we just
took the product of those so pretty

894
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
took the product of those so pretty
 

895
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,710
took the product of those so pretty
pretty easy in general if you have some

896
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
pretty easy in general if you have some
 

897
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,150
pretty easy in general if you have some
constant number of sequences you can

898
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
constant number of sequences you can
 

899
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,350
constant number of sequences you can
afford to do this you'll still get

900
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
afford to do this you'll still get
 

901
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,390
afford to do this you'll still get
polynomial

902
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
polynomial
 

903
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,590
polynomial
but of course once you go to end

904
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
but of course once you go to end
 

905
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,029
but of course once you go to end
sequences you can't afford this you

906
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
sequences you can't afford this you
 

907
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,150
sequences you can't afford this you
would get like an end to the n

908
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
would get like an end to the n
 

909
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,870
would get like an end to the n
behavior so that's kind of a limit to

910
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
behavior so that's kind of a limit to
 

911
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,470
behavior so that's kind of a limit to
how far you could go

912
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
how far you could go
 

913
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,470
how far you could go
two sequences is fine three sequences is

914
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
two sequences is fine three sequences is
 

915
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,070
two sequences is fine three sequences is
fine but n sequences

916
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
fine but n sequences
 

917
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,750
fine but n sequences
there probably is no polynomial time

918
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
there probably is no polynomial time
 

919
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,430
there probably is no polynomial time

for this problem uh cool i want to show

922
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
for this problem uh cool i want to show
 

923
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,430

you an example

924
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
you an example
 

925
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,549
you an example
i have an example here not i didn't

926
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
i have an example here not i didn't
 

927
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,789
i have an example here not i didn't
i didn't want to try out hieroglyphology

928
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
i didn't want to try out hieroglyphology
 

929
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,630
i didn't want to try out hieroglyphology
versus michelangelo

930
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
versus michelangelo
 

931
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,190
versus michelangelo
so i came up with another example their

932
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
so i came up with another example their
 

933
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,310
so i came up with another example their
habit

934
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
habit
 

935
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,870
habit
is to say hi so the longest common

936
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
is to say hi so the longest common
 

937
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,390
is to say hi so the longest common
subsequence of their and habit

938
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
subsequence of their and habit
 

939
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,310
subsequence of their and habit
is h i um and i mean it's a giant

940
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
is h i um and i mean it's a giant
 

941
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,150
is h i um and i mean it's a giant
well not that giant it looks kind of

942
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
well not that giant it looks kind of
 

943
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,669
well not that giant it looks kind of
like a grid graph

944
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
like a grid graph
 

945
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,310
like a grid graph
the base cases are out here because

946
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
the base cases are out here because
 

947
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,750
the base cases are out here because
those correspond

948
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
those correspond
 

949
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,710
those correspond
so uh when i say this each of these

950
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
so uh when i say this each of these
 

951
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,909
so uh when i say this each of these
nodes is a subproblem and this

952
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
nodes is a subproblem and this
 

953
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,590
nodes is a subproblem and this
corresponds to what is the longest

954
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
corresponds to what is the longest
 

955
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,230
corresponds to what is the longest
common

956
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240

and abbott and it should be i

960
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
and abbott and it should be i
 

961
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,390

it's the only letter they have in common

962
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
it's the only letter they have in common
 

963
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,830
it's the only letter they have in common
and that's why there's a 1 here to say

964
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
and that's why there's a 1 here to say

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
that
 

967
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,310
that
the longest common subsequence has a 1

968
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
the longest common subsequence has a 1
 

969
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,669
the longest common subsequence has a 1
has size 1.

been emptied
or when habit has been emptied so those

976
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
or when habit has been emptied so those
 

977
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,830

all have zeros

978
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
all have zeros
 

979
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,230
all have zeros
on the outside and then the problem we

980
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
on the outside and then the problem we
 

981
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,430
on the outside and then the problem we
care about is this one it's

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
care about is this one it's
 

983
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,990
care about is this one it's
there versus habit uh claim is the

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
there versus habit uh claim is the
 

985
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,029
there versus habit uh claim is the

length is two
 

987
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,070
length is two
and what i've drawn in here are what

988
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
and what i've drawn in here are what
 

989
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,549
and what i've drawn in here are what
i'll call

990
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:50,559
i'll call
 

991
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,549
i'll call
parent pointers like we talked about

992
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
parent pointers like we talked about
 

993
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,150
parent pointers like we talked about
with

994
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
with
 

995
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,230
with
bfs and shortest paths and so on

996
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
bfs and shortest paths and so on
 

997
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,830
bfs and shortest paths and so on
this is so we had this choice

998
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
this is so we had this choice
 

999
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,710
this is so we had this choice
uh sometimes we had a choice on whether

1000
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
uh sometimes we had a choice on whether
 

1001
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,990
uh sometimes we had a choice on whether
we

1002
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
we
 

1003
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,990
we
recursed here or recursed here was the

1004
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
recursed here or recursed here was the
 

1005
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,669
recursed here or recursed here was the
best thing to do

1006
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
best thing to do
 

1007
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,990
best thing to do
and so i'll just draw i'll draw in red

1008
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
and so i'll just draw i'll draw in red
 

1009
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,190
and so i'll just draw i'll draw in red
the arrow from

1010
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
the arrow from
 

1011
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,430
the arrow from
lij sorry to lij from one of these

1012
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,440
lij sorry to lij from one of these
 

1013
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,950
lij sorry to lij from one of these
in this case and in this case there's no

1014
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
in this case and in this case there's no
 

1015
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,630
in this case and in this case there's no
choice but i'll still draw in red that

1016
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
choice but i'll still draw in red that
 

1017
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,590
choice but i'll still draw in red that
arrow

1018
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600

 

1019
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,150

so uh these diagonal edges are exactly

1020
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
so uh these diagonal edges are exactly
 

1021
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,909
so uh these diagonal edges are exactly
the cases where the letters match here h

1022
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
the cases where the letters match here h
 

1023
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,350
the cases where the letters match here h
equals h um i equals i here so i draw

1024
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
equals h um i equals i here so i draw
 

1025
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,950
equals h um i equals i here so i draw
this diagonal edge that's that first

1026
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
this diagonal edge that's that first
 

1027
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,630
this diagonal edge that's that first
case where the letters are equal

1028
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
case where the letters are equal
 

1029
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,510
case where the letters are equal
and so i recurse by increasing i and j

1030
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
and so i recurse by increasing i and j
 

1031
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,029
and so i recurse by increasing i and j
that's why i get a diagonal edge

1032
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
that's why i get a diagonal edge
 

1033
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,909
that's why i get a diagonal edge
there's also one over here where t

1034
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
there's also one over here where t
 

1035
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,470
there's also one over here where t
equals t

1036
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480

 

1037
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,070

so for those we're getting a one plus

1038
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
so for those we're getting a one plus
 

1039
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,990
so for those we're getting a one plus
you see this one is one larger than the

1040
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
you see this one is one larger than the
 

1041
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,549
you see this one is one larger than the
zero

1042
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
zero
 

1043
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,230
zero
this two is one larger than the one this

1044
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,240
this two is one larger than the one this
 

1045
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,070
this two is one larger than the one this
one is one larger than the zero

1046
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
one is one larger than the zero
 

1047
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,110
one is one larger than the zero
and for every other vertex we are

1048
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120
and for every other vertex we are
 

1049
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,549
and for every other vertex we are
recursing this way and

1050
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
recursing this way and
 

1051
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,110
recursing this way and
this way uh we can see what those two

1052
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,120
this way uh we can see what those two
 

1053
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,110
this way uh we can see what those two
numbers are and we take the max

1054
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
numbers are and we take the max
 

1055
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,590
numbers are and we take the max
so this whole diagram is just filled in

1056
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
so this whole diagram is just filled in
 

1057
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,470
so this whole diagram is just filled in
uh by

1058
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
uh by
 

1059
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,350

1060
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
for each uh position where they're not
 

1061
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,990
for each uh position where they're not
equal

1062
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
and then at the end we get our answer
 

1089
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,510
and then at the end we get our answer
which is two and now if we pay attention

1090
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
which is two and now if we pay attention
 

1091
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,149
which is two and now if we pay attention

so i highlight the 2 edge and if i

1100
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
so i highlight the 2 edge and if i
 

1101
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,310
so i highlight the 2 edge and if i
follow this path

1102

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,870
follow this path
there should be a unique path to some

1104
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
there should be a unique path to some
 

1105
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,510
there should be a unique path to some
base case we don't know which one

1106
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
base case we don't know which one
 

1107
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,909
base case we don't know which one
and in this case the diagonal edges

1108
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
and in this case the diagonal edges
 

1109
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,190
and in this case the diagonal edges
correspond to my

1110
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
correspond to my
 

1111
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,950

matching letters so there's the h here

1112
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
matching letters so there's the h here
 

1113
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,390
matching letters so there's the h here
and followed by the i here and so high

1114
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
and followed by the i here and so high
 

1115
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,230
and followed by the i here and so high
is our longest common substring in

1116
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
is our longest common substring in
 

1117
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,750
is our longest common substring in
general we just follow these pointers

1118
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
general we just follow these pointers
 

1119
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,630
general we just follow these pointers
backwards

1120
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
backwards
 

1121
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,830
backwards
the red pointers and we get our answer

1122
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
the red pointers and we get our answer
 

1123
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,350
the red pointers and we get our answer
so not only do we compute

1124
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
so not only do we compute
 

1125
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,270
so not only do we compute
the length of the lcs but we actually

1126
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
the length of the lcs but we actually
 

1127
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,909
the length of the lcs but we actually
can find the lcs using

1128
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
can find the lcs using
 

1129
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:30,310
can find the lcs using
parent pointers so this is

1130
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
parent pointers so this is
 

1131
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,070
parent pointers so this is
and this is a concept you can use in

1132
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
and this is a concept you can use in
 

1133
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,510
and this is a concept you can use in
most dynamic programs

here we're just given one sequence

1168
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840

 

1169
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,830

like carbohydrate

1170
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840

 

1171
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,669

so this is a sequence of letters and i

1172
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
so this is a sequence of letters and i
 

1173
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,990
so this is a sequence of letters and i
want to find the longest subsequence of

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
want to find the longest subsequence of

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,430
want to find the longest subsequence of
this sequence

1176
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,440
this sequence
 

1177
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,750
this sequence
that is increasing strictly increasing

1178
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
that is increasing strictly increasing
 

1179
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,789
that is increasing strictly increasing
let's say so

1180
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799
let's say so
 

1181
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,230
let's say so
in this case alphabetically so i could

1182
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
in this case alphabetically so i could
 

1183
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,789
in this case alphabetically so i could
go i could include cr for example but

1184
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:52,799
go i could include cr for example but
 

1185
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,390
go i could include cr for example but
not cb that would be

1186
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
not cb that would be
 

1187
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,510
not cb that would be
a descending subsequence and in general

1188
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
a descending subsequence and in general
 

1189
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,029
a descending subsequence and in general
or in this example the right answer or a

1190
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
or in this example the right answer or a
 

1191
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,149
or in this example the right answer or a
right answer

1192
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
right answer
 

1193
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,990
right answer
is abort there aren't very many english

1194
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
is abort there aren't very many english
 

1195
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,590
is abort there aren't very many english
words that are increasing but

1196
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
words that are increasing but
 

1197
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,110
words that are increasing but
there are some and i looked through all

1198
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
there are some and i looked through all
 

1199
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,710
there are some and i looked through all
of them

1200
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
of them
 

1201
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,470
of them
because i just implemented this dynamic

1202
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
because i just implemented this dynamic
 

1203
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,750
because i just implemented this dynamic
program we're about to

1204
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
program we're about to
 

1205
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,990
program we're about to
to write down it take took me like two

1206
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
to write down it take took me like two
 

1207
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,830
to write down it take took me like two
minutes to write down the dp and then

1208
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
minutes to write down the dp and then
 

1209
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,350
minutes to write down the dp and then
more work to read the dictionary and

1210
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
more work to read the dictionary and
 

1211
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,310
more work to read the dictionary and
look for cool examples

1212
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
look for cool examples
 

1213
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,390
look for cool examples
so in general we're given some sequence

1214
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
so in general we're given some sequence
 

1215
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,789
so in general we're given some sequence
a

1216
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799

 

1217
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,669

and we want to find the longest

1218
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
and we want to find the longest
 

1219
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,270
and we want to find the longest
increasing subsequence of

1220
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,280
increasing subsequence of
 

1221
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,270
increasing subsequence of
a the longest sequence that is

1222
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
a the longest sequence that is
 

1223
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,990
a the longest sequence that is
increasing

1224
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000

 

1225
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,830

strictly

1226
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840

 

1227
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,149

you we could use the same thing to solve

1228
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
you we could use the same thing to solve
 

1229
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,549
you we could use the same thing to solve
not strictly increasing but

1230
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:48,559

 

1231
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,070

so here uh things are going to be a

1232
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
so here uh things are going to be a
 

1233
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,830
so here uh things are going to be a
little trickier it's easy in that we

1234
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
little trickier it's easy in that we
 

1235
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,590
little trickier it's easy in that we
just have a single sequence so again we

1236
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
just have a single sequence so again we
 

1237
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:53,909
just have a single sequence so again we
think

1238
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
think
 

1239
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,230
think
okay let's look at our chart here we

1240
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
okay let's look at our chart here we
 

1241
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,750
okay let's look at our chart here we
could try prefixes suffixes or

1242
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
could try prefixes suffixes or
 

1243
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,430
could try prefixes suffixes or
substrings i personally prefer

1244
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
substrings i personally prefer
 

1245
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,470
substrings i personally prefer
suffixes jason prefers prefixes uh

1246
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
suffixes jason prefers prefixes uh
 

1247
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,789
suffixes jason prefers prefixes uh
whatever you prefer is fine

1248
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
whatever you prefer is fine
 

1249
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,350
whatever you prefer is fine
um but always i'll generally start there

1250
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
um but always i'll generally start there
 

1251
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,789
um but always i'll generally start there
because there's nothing in this problem

1252
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
because there's nothing in this problem
 

1253
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,390
because there's nothing in this problem
that makes me think i need to

1254
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
that makes me think i need to
 

1255
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,789
that makes me think i need to
delete things from both ends one yeah

1256
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
delete things from both ends one yeah
 

1257
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,390
delete things from both ends one yeah
question isn't the answer to this

1258
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
question isn't the answer to this
 

1259
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,269
question isn't the answer to this
problem always 26.

1260
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
problem always 26.
 

1261
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,430
problem always 26.
so if is the ques is the answer always

1262
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
so if is the ques is the answer always
 

1263
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,310
so if is the ques is the answer always
at most 26

1264
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
at most 26
 

1265
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,029
at most 26
yes if you're dealing with english words

1266
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
yes if you're dealing with english words
 

1267
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,350
yes if you're dealing with english words
so

1268
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
so
 

1269
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,190
so
when i say sequence here this is a

1270
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
when i say sequence here this is a
 

1271
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,350
when i say sequence here this is a
sequence of arbitrary integers

1272
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
sequence of arbitrary integers
 

1273
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,029
sequence of arbitrary integers
word size integers so there you can have

1274
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,039
word size integers so there you can have
 

1275
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,029
word size integers so there you can have
a ton of variety this is just for the

1276
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
a ton of variety this is just for the
 

1277
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,470
a ton of variety this is just for the
fun of examples

1278
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
fun of examples
 

1279
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,470
fun of examples
i've drawn drawn this but even if the

1280
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
i've drawn drawn this but even if the
 

1281
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,549
i've drawn drawn this but even if the
answer is 26 finding that longest common

1282
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
answer is 26 finding that longest common
 

1283
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,230
answer is 26 finding that longest common
subsequence is

1284
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
subsequence is
 

1285
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,669
subsequence is
you know the obvious algorithm would be

1286
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
you know the obvious algorithm would be
 

1287
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,269
you know the obvious algorithm would be
to take all sub

1288
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
to take all sub
 

1289
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,830
to take all sub
strings of size 26 which is like n to

1290
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
strings of size 26 which is like n to
 

1291
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,870
strings of size 26 which is like n to
the 26

1292
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
the 26
 

1293
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,310
the 26
so that's we're going to do much faster

1294
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
so that's we're going to do much faster
 

1295
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,110
so that's we're going to do much faster
than that here and squared time

1296
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
than that here and squared time
 

1297
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,630
than that here and squared time
and then if you remove the strictly

1298
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
and then if you remove the strictly
 

1299
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,630
and then if you remove the strictly
increasing

1300
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
increasing
 

1301
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,830
increasing
then it can be arbitrarily large

1302
00:24:59,830 --> 00:24:59,840
then it can be arbitrarily large
 

1303
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,870
then it can be arbitrarily large
okay so um

1304
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
okay so um
 

1305
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,590
okay so um
let's try to do this uh

1306
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
let's try to do this uh
 

1307
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,230
let's try to do this uh
maybe i won't be so pessimistic to write

1308
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
maybe i won't be so pessimistic to write
 

1309
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,070
maybe i won't be so pessimistic to write
attempt here

1310
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
attempt here
 

1311
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,510
attempt here
let's just go for it uh

1312
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
let's just go for it uh
 

1313
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,269
let's just go for it uh
so i want some sub problems and i'm

1314
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
so i want some sub problems and i'm
 

1315
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,710
so i want some sub problems and i'm
going to choose suffixes

1316
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
going to choose suffixes
 

1317
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,110
going to choose suffixes
so i'm going to define l of i to be the

1318
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120
so i'm going to define l of i to be the
 

1319
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,110
so i'm going to define l of i to be the
longest increasing subsequence

1320
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
longest increasing subsequence
 

1321
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,630
longest increasing subsequence
of the suffix of a starting at i

1322
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
of the suffix of a starting at i
 

1323
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,310
of the suffix of a starting at i
okay that's the obvious thing to do uh

1324
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
okay that's the obvious thing to do uh
 

1325
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,070
okay that's the obvious thing to do uh
and now i'm gonna leave myself a little

1326
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
and now i'm gonna leave myself a little
 

1327
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,149
and now i'm gonna leave myself a little
space and then i'd like

1328
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
space and then i'd like
 

1329
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,990
space and then i'd like
a relation on these

1330
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
a relation on these
 

1331
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,190
a relation on these
so i'd like to say what l of i is

1332
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
so i'd like to say what l of i is
 

1333
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,789
so i'd like to say what l of i is
and what do i have to work with well i

1334
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
and what do i have to work with well i
 

1335
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,510
and what do i have to work with well i
have l of things larger than i

1336
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
have l of things larger than i
 

1337
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,029
have l of things larger than i
those would be smaller suffixes

1338
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
those would be smaller suffixes
 

1339
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,510
those would be smaller suffixes
uh but let's let's go back to what is a

1340
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
uh but let's let's go back to what is a
 

1341
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,630
uh but let's let's go back to what is a
question

1342
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
question
 

1343
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,590
question
that i could ask about this sub problem

1344
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
that i could ask about this sub problem
 

1345
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,310
that i could ask about this sub problem
that might

1346
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
that might
 

1347
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,630
that might
help me figure out what the longest

1348
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
help me figure out what the longest
 

1349
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,470
help me figure out what the longest
increasing subsequence looks like

1350
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
increasing subsequence looks like
 

1351
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,310
increasing subsequence looks like
so we're looking at a

1352
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320

 

1353
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,510

here's a from i on

1354
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
here's a from i on
 

1355
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,110
here's a from i on
longest increasing subsequence is sub

1356
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
longest increasing subsequence is sub
 

1357
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,870
longest increasing subsequence is sub
subsequence and we'd like to remove

1358
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
subsequence and we'd like to remove
 

1359
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,950
subsequence and we'd like to remove
letter i now when we do that there are

1360
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:14,960
letter i now when we do that there are
 

1361
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,630
letter i now when we do that there are
two choices maybe i

1362
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640
two choices maybe i
 

1363
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,710
two choices maybe i
is in the longest increasing subsequence

1364
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
is in the longest increasing subsequence
 

1365
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,750
is in the longest increasing subsequence
or it's not in

1366
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,760
or it's not in
 

1367
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,269
or it's not in
so the question i would like to answer

1368
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
so the question i would like to answer
 

1369
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,190
so the question i would like to answer
is

1370
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
is
 

1371
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,470
is
is i in the longest increasing

1372
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
is i in the longest increasing
 

1373
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,549
is i in the longest increasing
subsequence of a

1374
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
subsequence of a
 

1375
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,269
subsequence of a
of a from i onwards

1376
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279

 

1377
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,870

this is a binary question there are two

1378
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
this is a binary question there are two
 

1379
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,029
this is a binary question there are two
options so again just like before

1380
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
options so again just like before
 

1381
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,950
options so again just like before
and so i can brute force those two

1382
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
and so i can brute force those two
 

1383
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,070
and so i can brute force those two
options

1384
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
options
 

1385
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,470
options
the trouble and then i want the longest

1386
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
the trouble and then i want the longest
 

1387
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,350
the trouble and then i want the longest
one so i'm going to take the max

1388
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
one so i'm going to take the max
 

1389
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,110
one so i'm going to take the max
so i'd like to take the max of something

1390
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,120
so i'd like to take the max of something
 

1391
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,549
so i'd like to take the max of something
like

1392
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
like
 

1393
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,230
like
li plus one so in the case that i don't

1394
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,240
li plus one so in the case that i don't
 

1395
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,470
li plus one so in the case that i don't
put i in the solution that's that's fine

1396
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
put i in the solution that's that's fine
 

1397
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,830
put i in the solution that's that's fine
then i just look at

1398
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:55,840
then i just look at
 

1399
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,190
then i just look at
i plus 1 on and recursively compute that

1400
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
i plus 1 on and recursively compute that
 

1401
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,549
i plus 1 on and recursively compute that
and that would be my answer

1402
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
and that would be my answer
 

1403
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,789
and that would be my answer
and the other option is that i do put i

1404
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:02,799
and the other option is that i do put i
 

1405
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,390
and the other option is that i do put i
in the longest increasing subsequence so

1406
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,400
in the longest increasing subsequence so
 

1407
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,110
in the longest increasing subsequence so
i do 1

1408
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
i do 1
 

1409
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,190
i do 1
plus the rest

1410
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
plus the rest
 

1411
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,789
plus the rest
no i plus 1. okay if i if i close this

1412
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
no i plus 1. okay if i if i close this
 

1413
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,590
no i plus 1. okay if i if i close this
brace

1414
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
brace
 

1415
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,269
brace
this would be a very strange recurrence

1416
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
this would be a very strange recurrence
 

1417
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,870
this would be a very strange recurrence
right because this is always bigger than

1418
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:16,880
right because this is always bigger than
 

1419
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,669
right because this is always bigger than
this one

1420
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
this one
 

1421
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,990
this one
so this there's something wrong here and

1422
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
so this there's something wrong here and
 

1423
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,789
so this there's something wrong here and
there's something wrong

1424
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
there's something wrong
 

1425
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,630
there's something wrong
is i haven't enforced increasing at all

1426
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:24,640
is i haven't enforced increasing at all
 

1427
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,909
is i haven't enforced increasing at all
there's no constraints here it's just

1428
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
there's no constraints here it's just
 

1429
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,669
there's no constraints here it's just
saying well i'll put i in

1430
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
saying well i'll put i in
 

1431
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,230
saying well i'll put i in
and then i'll do whatever remains and

1432
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
and then i'll do whatever remains and
 

1433
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,830
and then i'll do whatever remains and
i'll pray that that's increasing

1434
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:31,840
i'll pray that that's increasing
 

1435
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,110
i'll pray that that's increasing
probably won't be because indeed if

1436
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
probably won't be because indeed if
 

1437
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,549
probably won't be because indeed if
if i is a letter or as a number that is

1438
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:38,559
if i is a letter or as a number that is
 

1439
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,190
if i is a letter or as a number that is
strictly

1440
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
strictly
 

1441
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,669
strictly
greater than i plus 1 then this will be

1442
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
greater than i plus 1 then this will be
 

1443
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,630
greater than i plus 1 then this will be
wrong so i really

1444
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
wrong so i really
 

1445
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,190
wrong so i really
can't always do this i need to somehow

1446
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
can't always do this i need to somehow
 

1447
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,710
can't always do this i need to somehow
know

1448
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
know
 

1449
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,950
know
i could check whether i plus one is is

1450
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
i could check whether i plus one is is
 

1451
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,389
i could check whether i plus one is is
in the answer but some but i don't know

1452
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:50,399
in the answer but some but i don't know
 

1453
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,230
in the answer but some but i don't know
maybe i plus one

1454
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
maybe i plus one
 

1455
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,470
maybe i plus one
so i can check whether i the letter i is

1456
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,480
so i can check whether i the letter i is
 

1457
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,310
so i can check whether i the letter i is
less than the letter i plus one

1458
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
less than the letter i plus one
 

1459
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,789
less than the letter i plus one
uh but maybe i put this in the longest

1460
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
uh but maybe i put this in the longest
 

1461
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,470
uh but maybe i put this in the longest
increasing subsequence then i put this

1462
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
increasing subsequence then i put this
 

1463
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,990
increasing subsequence then i put this
in the longest increasing subsequence

1464
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
in the longest increasing subsequence
 

1465
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,669
in the longest increasing subsequence
and so i need to compare these two items

1466
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:03,679
and so i need to compare these two items
 

1467
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,789
and so i need to compare these two items
but i don't know when that's going to

1468
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
but i don't know when that's going to
 

1469
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,149
but i don't know when that's going to
happen

1470
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:06,159
happen
 

1471
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,310
happen
things seem really hard and indeed

1472
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320
things seem really hard and indeed
 

1473
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,430
things seem really hard and indeed
there's no

1474
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
there's no
 

1475
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,389
there's no
way from this sub problem definition to

way from this sub problem definition to
 

1477
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,870
way from this sub problem definition to

1478
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:14,880
write down a relation
 

1479
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,590
write down a relation
but there is a slight tweak to this

1480
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
but there is a slight tweak to this
 

1481
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,110
but there is a slight tweak to this

1482

1483
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,789

that makes it work so um

1484
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
that makes it work so um
 

1485
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,950
that makes it work so um
the the trouble we have here and this is

1486
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
the the trouble we have here and this is
 

1487
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,549
the the trouble we have here and this is
the idea of sub problem

1488
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
the idea of sub problem
 

1489
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,990
the idea of sub problem
constraints or conditions the trouble

1490
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
constraints or conditions the trouble
 

1491
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,830
constraints or conditions the trouble
we have is when when we recursively

1492
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
we have is when when we recursively
 

1493
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,029
we have is when when we recursively
compute the

1494
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:33,039
compute the
 

1495
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,549
compute the
longest increasing subsequence on the

1496
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
longest increasing subsequence on the
 

1497
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,110
longest increasing subsequence on the
remainder we don't know

1498
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,120
remainder we don't know
 

1499
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,789
remainder we don't know
the first item in that answer

1500
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
the first item in that answer
 

1501
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,310
the first item in that answer
maybe it's i plus one maybe it's some

1502
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,320
maybe it's i plus one maybe it's some
 

1503
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,630
maybe it's i plus one maybe it's some
guy over here if we knew who it was then

1504
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,640
guy over here if we knew who it was then
 

1505
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,230
guy over here if we knew who it was then
we could compare that item to

1506
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
we could compare that item to
 

1507
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,909
we could compare that item to
item i and so what we'd like to do is

1508
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
item i and so what we'd like to do is
 

1509
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,149
item i and so what we'd like to do is
add a constraint to this sub-problem

1510
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
add a constraint to this sub-problem
 

1511
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,029
add a constraint to this sub-problem
that somehow

1512
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
that somehow
 

1513
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,710
that somehow
lets us know where the longest

1514
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
lets us know where the longest
 

1515
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,950
lets us know where the longest
increasing subsequence starts

1516
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
increasing subsequence starts
 

1517
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,389
increasing subsequence starts
so what i would like to say is longest

1518
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
so what i would like to say is longest
 

1519
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,389
so what i would like to say is longest
increasing subsequence of that suffix

1520
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
increasing subsequence of that suffix
 

1521
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,470
increasing subsequence of that suffix
that starts

1522
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480

 

1523
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,230

with a of i

1524
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,240
with a of i
 

1525
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,510
with a of i
so in other words it includes

1526
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
so in other words it includes
 

1527
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,110
so in other words it includes
a of i

1528
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120

 

1529
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,230

okay this was a separate question

1530
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240

 

1531
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,310

okay this is a bit of a funny constraint

1532
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
okay this is a bit of a funny constraint
 

1533
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,830
okay this is a bit of a funny constraint
it changes the problem

1534
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
it changes the problem
 

1535
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,230
it changes the problem
it's no longer what we want to solve if

1536
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,240
it's no longer what we want to solve if
 

1537
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,389
it's no longer what we want to solve if
you think about the original problem

1538
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399

 

1539
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,029

before it was solving l of 0 we just

1540
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,039
before it was solving l of 0 we just
 

1541
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,470
before it was solving l of 0 we just
want the longest increasing subsequence

1542
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,480
want the longest increasing subsequence
 

1543
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,510
want the longest increasing subsequence
of the whole thing

1544
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
of the whole thing
 

1545
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,669
of the whole thing
now it's not necessarily l of zero this

1546
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
now it's not necessarily l of zero this
 

1547
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,269
now it's not necessarily l of zero this
would be l of zero means what is the

1548
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
would be l of zero means what is the
 

1549
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,950
would be l of zero means what is the
longest increasing subsequence of the

1550
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
longest increasing subsequence of the
 

1551
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,830
longest increasing subsequence of the
whole

1552
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
whole
 

1553
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,870
whole
of the whole sequence a that includes

1554
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
of the whole sequence a that includes
 

1555
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,710
of the whole sequence a that includes
the first letter of a

1556
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:50,720
the first letter of a
 

1557
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,789
the first letter of a
and maybe we do include the first letter

1558
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
and maybe we do include the first letter
 

1559
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,990
and maybe we do include the first letter
of a maybe we don't we don't

1560
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,000
of a maybe we don't we don't
 

1561
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,029
of a maybe we don't we don't
know where the longest increasing

1562
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
know where the longest increasing
 

1563
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,549
know where the longest increasing
subsequence starts here for example it

1564
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
subsequence starts here for example it
 

1565
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,830
subsequence starts here for example it
didn't it started at the second letter

1566
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
didn't it started at the second letter
 

1567
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,549
didn't it started at the second letter
but conveniently it's okay that we don't

1568
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
but conveniently it's okay that we don't
 

1569
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,350
but conveniently it's okay that we don't
know

1570
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
know
 

1571
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,510
know
because that's just another question we

1572
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
because that's just another question we
 

1573
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,870
because that's just another question we
could ask

1574
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:06,880
could ask
 

1575
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,590
could ask
is where do we start where might the lis

1576
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:09,600
is where do we start where might the lis
 

1577
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,149
is where do we start where might the lis
start

1578
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:10,159
start
 

1579
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,510
start
to start at the first letter second

1580
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
to start at the first letter second
 

1581
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,870
to start at the first letter second
letter third letter there's only n

1582
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
letter third letter there's only n
 

1583
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,669
letter third letter there's only n
choices

1584
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
choices
 

1585
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,269
choices
and let's just take the max of all of

1586
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,279
and let's just take the max of all of
 

1587
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,669
and let's just take the max of all of
them so before i get to the relation

1588
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
them so before i get to the relation
 

1589
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,590
them so before i get to the relation
let's solve this problem

1590
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
let's solve this problem
 

1591
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,350
let's solve this problem
i just want the max of l i

1592
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
i just want the max of l i
 

1593
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,269
i just want the max of l i
for all i

1594
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279

 

1595
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,950

i guess we've been writing size of a

1596
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
i guess we've been writing size of a
 

1597
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,430
i guess we've been writing size of a
here

1598
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440

 

1599
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,549

okay the maximum will beat the overall

1600
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
okay the maximum will beat the overall
 

1601
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,149
okay the maximum will beat the overall
longest increasing subsequence so if i

1602
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
longest increasing subsequence so if i
 

1603
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,669
longest increasing subsequence so if i
could find longest increasing

1604
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:39,679
could find longest increasing
 

1605
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,029
could find longest increasing
subsequence that includes the first

1606
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
subsequence that includes the first
 

1607
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,430
subsequence that includes the first
letter

1608
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,440
letter
 

1609
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,269
letter
and or the longest one that's includes

1610
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
and or the longest one that's includes
 

1611
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,630
and or the longest one that's includes
the second letter and so on

1612
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
the second letter and so on
 

1613
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,470
the second letter and so on
so it starts at the first letter starts

1614
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
so it starts at the first letter starts
 

1615
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,750
so it starts at the first letter starts
the second letter then

1616
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:47,760
the second letter then
 

1617
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,549
the second letter then
this max will be the longest overall so

1618
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
this max will be the longest overall so
 

1619
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,310
this max will be the longest overall so
if i could this sub problem is not what

1620
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
if i could this sub problem is not what
 

1621
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,909
if i could this sub problem is not what
i really wanted but it's still good

1622
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
i really wanted but it's still good
 

1623
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,590
i really wanted but it's still good
enough because it lets me

1624
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,600
enough because it lets me
 

1625
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,750
enough because it lets me
solve my original problem and this is

1626
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
solve my original problem and this is
 

1627
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,950
solve my original problem and this is
adding an extra constraint

1628
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:00,960
adding an extra constraint
 

1629
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,070
adding an extra constraint
to my sub problem and doing this is

1630
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
to my sub problem and doing this is
 

1631
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,430
to my sub problem and doing this is
challenging thinking about what the

1632
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:05,440
challenging thinking about what the
 

1633
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,509
challenging thinking about what the
right constraint that would let you

1634
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:07,519
right constraint that would let you
 

1635
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,830
right constraint that would let you
solve your problem is tricky especially

1636
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
solve your problem is tricky especially
 

1637
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,110
solve your problem is tricky especially
in the beginning

1638
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,120
in the beginning
 

1639
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,950
in the beginning
but for now let's just take this as a

1640
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
but for now let's just take this as a
 

1641
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,110
but for now let's just take this as a
thing that works why does it work

1642
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
thing that works why does it work
 

1643
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,149
thing that works why does it work
because now i can say well

1644
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
because now i can say well
 

1645
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,789
because now i can say well
this this term was fine max so i'm

1646
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:20,799
this this term was fine max so i'm
 

1647
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,909
this this term was fine max so i'm
trying to write

1648
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
trying to write
 

1649
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,590
trying to write
longest increasing subsequence starting

1650
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
longest increasing subsequence starting
 

1651
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,430
longest increasing subsequence starting
with the ith letter

1652
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:25,440
with the ith letter
 

1653
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,549
with the ith letter
versus uh

1654
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
versus uh
 

1655
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,310
versus uh
yeah actually no this is just going to

1656
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320
yeah actually no this is just going to
 

1657
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,070
yeah actually no this is just going to
be different

1658
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080

 

1659
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,389

okay so now i get to the central issue

1660
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
okay so now i get to the central issue
 

1661
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,110
okay so now i get to the central issue
which is

1662
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,120
which is
 

1663
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,230
which is
i i know by the definition of l i that

1664
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,240
i i know by the definition of l i that
 

1665
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,630
i i know by the definition of l i that
i include letter i this is going to be

1666
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:42,640
i include letter i this is going to be
 

1667
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,470
i include letter i this is going to be
in my longest increasing subsequence

1668
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
in my longest increasing subsequence
 

1669
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,310
in my longest increasing subsequence
that's what i'm looking for

1670
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
that's what i'm looking for
 

1671
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,830
that's what i'm looking for
by this definition but i don't know what

1672
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
by this definition but i don't know what
 

1673
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,909
by this definition but i don't know what
the second letter is

1674
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
the second letter is
 

1675
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,750
the second letter is
could be i plus one could be i plus two

1676
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
could be i plus one could be i plus two
 

1677
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,310
could be i plus one could be i plus two
could be anything bigger

1678
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
could be anything bigger
 

1679
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,149
could be anything bigger
whenever there's something i don't know

1680
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:58,159
whenever there's something i don't know
 

1681
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,310
whenever there's something i don't know
i'll just brute force it

1682
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
i'll just brute force it
 

1683
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,870
i'll just brute force it
right i don't care uh that i don't know

1684
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
right i don't care uh that i don't know
 

1685
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,470
right i don't care uh that i don't know
i'll just take a max over all the

1686
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480
i'll just take a max over all the
 

1687
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,470
i'll just take a max over all the
possible choices let's say that the next

1688
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,480
possible choices let's say that the next
 

1689
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,549
possible choices let's say that the next
the next letter included in the longest

1690
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:08,559
the next letter included in the longest
 

1691
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,830
the next letter included in the longest
increasing subsequence i

1692
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
increasing subsequence i
 

1693
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,110
increasing subsequence i
is j then i would like to look at

1694
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
is j then i would like to look at
 

1695
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,310
is j then i would like to look at
l of j now i don't know what j

1696
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,320
l of j now i don't know what j
 

1697
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,909
l of j now i don't know what j
is but i'll just brute force all

1698
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:17,919
is but i'll just brute force all
 

1699
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,830
is but i'll just brute force all
possible choices for j so it's going to

1700
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:19,840
possible choices for j so it's going to
 

1701
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,310
possible choices for j so it's going to
be i

1702
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,320
be i
 

1703
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,389
be i
strictly less than j because i don't

1704
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:22,399
strictly less than j because i don't
 

1705
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,230
strictly less than j because i don't
want to include the same letter

1706
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
want to include the same letter
 

1707
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,430
want to include the same letter
i again and otherwise i would get an

1708
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,440
i again and otherwise i would get an
 

1709
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,950
i again and otherwise i would get an
infinite recursive loop if i put less

1710
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
infinite recursive loop if i put less
 

1711
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,870
infinite recursive loop if i put less
than or equal to here

1712
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:30,880
than or equal to here
 

1713
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,590
than or equal to here
uh and maybe i don't do anything else up

1714
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
uh and maybe i don't do anything else up
 

1715
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,110
uh and maybe i don't do anything else up
to n

1716
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,120
to n
 

1717
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,430
to n
and uh okay not quite done

1718
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440

 

1719
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,149

now this is the interesting part i can

1720
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
now this is the interesting part i can
 

1721
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,029
now this is the interesting part i can
enforce

1722
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
enforce
 

1723
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,190
enforce
increasing because i can't just choose

1724
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,200
increasing because i can't just choose
 

1725
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,389
increasing because i can't just choose
any letter

1726
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:46,399
any letter
 

1727
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,830
any letter
j to the right of i also the the

1728
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,840
j to the right of i also the the
 

1729
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,350
j to the right of i also the the
number that's or letter that's written

1730
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
number that's or letter that's written
 

1731
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,269
number that's or letter that's written
in here has to be greater than the

1732
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:53,279
in here has to be greater than the
 

1733
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,710
in here has to be greater than the
number that's written here that's the

1734
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
number that's written here that's the
 

1735
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,710
number that's written here that's the
strictly increasing property

1736
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:56,720
strictly increasing property
 

1737
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,750
strictly increasing property
so i can add as a constraint

1738
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
so i can add as a constraint
 

1739
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,310
so i can add as a constraint
in this max to say

1740
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
in this max to say
 

1741
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,870
in this max to say
a of i is strictly less than a of j

1742
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
a of i is strictly less than a of j
 

1743
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,630
a of i is strictly less than a of j
and if you wanted non-strictly

1744
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
and if you wanted non-strictly
 

1745
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,909
and if you wanted non-strictly
increasing you would add an

1746
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
increasing you would add an
 

1747
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,430
increasing you would add an
equal there okay this is mathematical

1748
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,440
equal there okay this is mathematical
 

1749
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,430
equal there okay this is mathematical
notation in python you would say

1750
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:17,440
notation in python you would say
 

1751
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,789
notation in python you would say
max open paren of this thing for

1752
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:20,799
max open paren of this thing for
 

1753
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,389
max open paren of this thing for
j in this range if this holds

1754
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
j in this range if this holds
 

1755
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,389
j in this range if this holds
so i'm just doing the for loop but i

1756
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
so i'm just doing the for loop but i
 

1757
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,590
so i'm just doing the for loop but i
only do

1758
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
only do
 

1759
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,909
only do
i only look at the possible choices for

1760
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:29,919
i only look at the possible choices for
 

1761
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,710
i only look at the possible choices for
j

1762
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
j
 

1763
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,230
j
uh when uh the strict increasing

1764
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,240
uh when uh the strict increasing
 

1765
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,350
uh when uh the strict increasing
property holds

1766
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
property holds
 

1767
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,990
property holds
and then when that holds i put check

1768
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
and then when that holds i put check
 

1769
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,509
and then when that holds i put check
this now this set might be empty

1770
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:39,519
this now this set might be empty
 

1771
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,029
this now this set might be empty
i need to define what the max is when

1772
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
i need to define what the max is when
 

1773
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,110
i need to define what the max is when
it's empty then i will just

1774
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,120
it's empty then i will just
 

1775
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,190
it's empty then i will just
say oh i also need a oneplus don't i

1776
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200

 

1777
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,230

let me just do one plus so we're told

1778
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
let me just do one plus so we're told
 

1779
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,310
let me just do one plus so we're told
that i is in the answer so we always get

1780
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,320
that i is in the answer so we always get
 

1781
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,669
that i is in the answer so we always get
one

1782
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
one
 

1783
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,230
one
and then the remainder is this or

1784
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
and then the remainder is this or
 

1785
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,269
and then the remainder is this or
zero if there are no uh

1786
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:05,279
zero if there are no uh
 

1787
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,350
zero if there are no uh
j's there if there are no aj's greater

1788
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,360
j's there if there are no aj's greater
 

1789
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,710
j's there if there are no aj's greater
than a i

1790
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
than a i
 

1791
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,629
than a i
uh then we'll default to zero and say

1792
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
uh then we'll default to zero and say
 

1793
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,990
uh then we'll default to zero and say
that i is the only item in my increasing

1794
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
that i is the only item in my increasing
 

1795
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,310
that i is the only item in my increasing
subsequence

1796
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
subsequence
 

1797
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,909
subsequence
okay so there are a few details to get

1798
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:19,919
okay so there are a few details to get
 

1799
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,510
okay so there are a few details to get
right but in general once

1800
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
right but in general once
 

1801
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,629
right but in general once
once you figure out what these

1802
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:22,639
once you figure out what these
 

1803
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,629
once you figure out what these
recurrences look like they're very

1804
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
recurrences look like they're very
 

1805
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,389
recurrences look like they're very
simple i mean this is one line of code

1806
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
simple i mean this is one line of code
 

1807
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,869
simple i mean this is one line of code
and then all you need in addition to

1808
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
and then all you need in addition to
 

1809
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,750
and then all you need in addition to
this

1810
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
this
 

1811
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,869
this
is the original subproblem and some

1812
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:34,879
is the original subproblem and some
 

1813
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,230
is the original subproblem and some
other

1814
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
other
 

1815
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,069
other
things we need the

1816
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079

 

1817
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,550

base cases but i should do them in order

1818
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:42,560
base cases but i should do them in order
 

1819
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,629
base cases but i should do them in order
topological order

1820
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:46,639

 

1821
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,629

is just the usual for loop because i'm

1822
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
is just the usual for loop because i'm
 

1823
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,149
is just the usual for loop because i'm
doing suffixes

1824
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
doing suffixes
 

1825
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,109
doing suffixes
it's going to be i equals length of a

1826
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
it's going to be i equals length of a
 

1827
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,030
it's going to be i equals length of a
down to zero

1828
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
down to zero
 

1829
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,349
down to zero
uh base case is going to be

1830
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
uh base case is going to be
 

1831
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,630
uh base case is going to be
l of length of a which is zero

1832
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
l of length of a which is zero
 

1833
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,470
l of length of a which is zero
because there's no letters in that

1834
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,480
because there's no letters in that
 

1835
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,670
because there's no letters in that
suffix

1836
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:05,680
suffix
 

1837
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,950
suffix
um and we already did o and then time

1838
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:10,960
um and we already did o and then time
 

1839
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,550
um and we already did o and then time
okay this is a little different from the

1840
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
okay this is a little different from the
 

1841
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,870
okay this is a little different from the
past examples so number of subproblems

1842
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
past examples so number of subproblems
 

1843
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,550
past examples so number of subproblems
just like usual is

1844
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:16,560
just like usual is
 

1845
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,589
just like usual is
linear length of a

1846
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599

1849
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,870

there's only one sequence we're thinking

1850
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
there's only one sequence we're thinking
 

1851
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,589
there's only one sequence we're thinking
about now unlike the previous example

1852
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:27,599
about now unlike the previous example
 

1853
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,870
about now unlike the previous example
but the work we're doing in this

1854
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:28,880
but the work we're doing in this
 

1855
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,950
but the work we're doing in this
relation now is non-trivial work

1856
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
relation now is non-trivial work
 

1857
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,550
relation now is non-trivial work
before we were just guessing among two

1858
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
before we were just guessing among two
 

1859
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,630
before we were just guessing among two
different choices now we're guessing

1860
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:34,640
different choices now we're guessing
 

1861
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,270
different choices now we're guessing
among

1862
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
among
 

1863
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,910
among
up to n different choices this n here is

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
up to n different choices this n here is
 

1865
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,069
up to n different choices this n here is
length of a

1867
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,069

and so we have theta

1868
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,079
and so we have theta
 

1869
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,589
and so we have theta
length of a

1870
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:49,599

 

1871
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,349

non-recursive work

1872
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:55,359

 

1873
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,870

that we're doing in each subproblem

1874
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:00,880

 

1875
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,870

or you might think of this as choices

1876
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
or you might think of this as choices
 

1877
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,069
or you might think of this as choices
that we're considering

1878
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079

 

1879
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,150

and for each choice we're just spending

1880
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,160
and for each choice we're just spending
 

1881
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,589
and for each choice we're just spending
i mean we're just taking a max of those

1882
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:09,599
i mean we're just taking a max of those
 

1883
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,710
i mean we're just taking a max of those
items adding one

1884
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,720
items adding one
 

1885
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,870
items adding one
so that's a constant overhead and so we

1886
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
so that's a constant overhead and so we
 

1887
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,270
so that's a constant overhead and so we
just get this product

1888
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
just get this product
 

1889
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,750
just get this product
which is a squared

1890
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760

 

1891
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,829

cool so that's the longest increasing

1892
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:24,839
cool so that's the longest increasing
 

1893
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,790
cool so that's the longest increasing
subsequence make sure i didn't miss

1894
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:26,800
subsequence make sure i didn't miss
 

1895
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,630

anything else

1896
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
anything else
 

1897
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,670
anything else
so we're using this idea of asking a

1898
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
so we're using this idea of asking a
 

1899
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,790
so we're using this idea of asking a
question

1900
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:32,800
question
 

1901
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,190
question
and guessing or brute forcing the answer

1902
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,200
and guessing or brute forcing the answer
 

1903
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,390
and guessing or brute forcing the answer
to that question

1904
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400
to that question
 

1905
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,790
to that question
in two places one place is

1906
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,800
in two places one place is
 

1907
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,829
in two places one place is
we're promising we're being we're

00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
we're promising we're being we're
 

1909
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,910
we're promising we're being we're
requesting that the longest increasing

1910
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:45,920
requesting that the longest increasing
 

1911
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,510
requesting that the longest increasing
sub sequence starts at i

1912
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,520
sub sequence starts at i
 

1913
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,430
sub sequence starts at i
so then the question is well what is the

1914
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,440
so then the question is well what is the
 

1915
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,950
so then the question is well what is the
very second

1916
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
very second
 

1917
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,109
very second
uh item that's in the longest increasing

1918
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
uh item that's in the longest increasing
 

1919
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,870
uh item that's in the longest increasing
subsequence that it starts with i

1920
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:56,880

1921
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,470
subsequence that it starts with i
uh we're calling that j and we're brute

1922
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
uh we're calling that j and we're brute
 

1923
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,550
uh we're calling that j and we're brute
forcing all the possible choices that j

1924
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,560
forcing all the possible choices that j
 

1925
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,670
forcing all the possible choices that j
could be which conveniently lets us

1926
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
could be which conveniently lets us
 

1927
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,910
could be which conveniently lets us
check confirm that it's actually an

check confirm that it's actually an
increasing subsequence locally from i to

1930
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,000
increasing subsequence locally from i to
 

1931
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,710
increasing subsequence locally from i to
j

1932
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
j
 

1933
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,550
j
and then l of j will take care of the

1934
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
and then l of j will take care of the
 

1935
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,990
and then l of j will take care of the
rest by induction

1936
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,000
rest by induction
 

1937
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,349
rest by induction
the rest of the longest increasing

1938
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:15,359
the rest of the longest increasing
 

1939
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,270
the rest of the longest increasing
subsequence starting at j will also be

1940
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
subsequence starting at j will also be
 

1941
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,109
subsequence starting at j will also be
increasing and so this guarantees by

1942
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:19,119
increasing and so this guarantees by
 

1943
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:19,829
increasing and so this guarantees by
induction

1944
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:19,839
induction
 

1945
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,790
induction
the whole thing will be increasing then

1946
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
the whole thing will be increasing then
 

1947
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,069
the whole thing will be increasing then
we also use this

1948
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:24,079
we also use this
 

1949
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,550
we also use this
uh local brute force to solve the

1950
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:26,560
uh local brute force to solve the
 

1951
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,589
uh local brute force to solve the
original problem

1952
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:27,599
original problem
 

1953
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,030
original problem
so we added this constraint of starting

1954
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,040
so we added this constraint of starting
 

1955
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,710
so we added this constraint of starting
at i but we didn't actually know overall

1956
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:30,720
at i but we didn't actually know overall
 

1957
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,150
at i but we didn't actually know overall
where to start

1958
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
where to start
 

1959
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,750
where to start
but that's fine because there's only

1960
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:33,760
but that's fine because there's only
 

1961
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,069
but that's fine because there's only
eight choices so i should mention

1962
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:36,079
eight choices so i should mention
 

1963
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,790
eight choices so i should mention
in the running time analysis so they're

1964
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:38,800
in the running time analysis so they're
 

1965
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,710
in the running time analysis so they're
solving the sub problems

1966
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
solving the sub problems
 

1967
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,270
solving the sub problems
that's fine but then there's also a plus

1968
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,280
that's fine but then there's also a plus
 

1969
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,030
that's fine but then there's also a plus
whatever it costs to solve the original

1970
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,040
whatever it costs to solve the original
 

1971
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,910
whatever it costs to solve the original
problem

1972
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:45,920
problem
 

1973
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,349
problem
but that's okay that's length of a

1974
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:49,359
but that's okay that's length of a
 

1975
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,109
but that's okay that's length of a
so this was all of this plus length of a

1976
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
so this was all of this plus length of a
 

1977
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,510
so this was all of this plus length of a
is still length of a squared

1978
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:57,520

 

1979
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,109

okay but if you're doing you know

1980
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
okay but if you're doing you know
 

1981
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,710
okay but if you're doing you know
exponential work here that would be bad

1982
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:00,720
exponential work here that would be bad
 

1983
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,910
exponential work here that would be bad
we have to do some

i mean it's almost the complete graph

2016
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:37,839
i mean it's almost the complete graph
 

2017
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,990
i mean it's almost the complete graph
but we only draw edges

2018
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
but we only draw edges
 

2019
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,630
but we only draw edges
from smaller letters to bigger letters

2020
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:42,640
from smaller letters to bigger letters
 

2021
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,069
from smaller letters to bigger letters
so we draw from e to m

2022
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,079
so we draw from e to m
 

2023
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,109
so we draw from e to m
from e to p from e not to a there's no

2024
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
from e to p from e not to a there's no
 

2025
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,230
from e to p from e not to a there's no
edge from e to a

2026
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,240
edge from e to a
 

2027
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,910
edge from e to a
from e to t not from e to h

2028
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:51,920
from e to t not from e to h
 

2029
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,310
from e to t not from e to h
but yes from e to y and then we also

2030
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:54,320
but yes from e to y and then we also
 

2031
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,150
but yes from e to y and then we also
draw from e to the base case which is

2032
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160
draw from e to the base case which is
 

2033
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,829
draw from e to the base case which is
there's no more letters

2034
00:38:57,829 --> 00:38:57,839
there's no more letters
 

2035
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,510
there's no more letters
that was that that uh edge to the base

2036
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:01,520
that was that that uh edge to the base
 

2037
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:01,990
that was that that uh edge to the base
case

2038
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,000
case
 

2039
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,270
case
is

2040
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280

 

2041
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,310

uh corresponds to the zero

2042
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
uh corresponds to the zero
 

2043
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,950
uh corresponds to the zero
or i guess this n where we say ah let's

2044
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:10,960
or i guess this n where we say ah let's
 

2045
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,589
or i guess this n where we say ah let's
just

2046
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:11,599
just
 

2047
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,990
just
recurse let's just throw away

2048
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,000

 

2049
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,270

actually maybe we don't need the union

2050
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
actually maybe we don't need the union
 

2051
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,190
actually maybe we don't need the union
zero there in fact because

2052
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
zero there in fact because
 

2053
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,550
zero there in fact because
we include l of n which is the empty

2054
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,560
we include l of n which is the empty
 

2055
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,230
we include l of n which is the empty
substring then the definition of

2056
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,240
substring then the definition of
 

2057
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,550
substring then the definition of
of l is a little funny what does it mean

2058
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,560
of l is a little funny what does it mean
 

2059
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,470
of l is a little funny what does it mean
to say you start with a of n

2060
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
to say you start with a of n
 

2061
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,470
to say you start with a of n
hm right a of n is not defined so that's

2062
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,480
hm right a of n is not defined so that's
 

2063
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,510
hm right a of n is not defined so that's
not so nice

2064
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
not so nice
 

2065
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,670
not so nice
so maybe i'll fix that

2066
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680

 

2067
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,670

and decrease equals case

2068
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
and decrease equals case
 

2069
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,030
and decrease equals case
okay but i'm still going to draw an edge

2070
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,040
okay but i'm still going to draw an edge
 

2071
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,790
okay but i'm still going to draw an edge
there conceptually say oh we're just

2072
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:46,800
there conceptually say oh we're just
 

2073
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,710
there conceptually say oh we're just
done at that point

2074
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:48,720
done at that point
 

2075
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,349
done at that point
that's the base case where we have no

2076
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
that's the base case where we have no
 

2077
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,390
that's the base case where we have no
string left

2078
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:52,400
string left
 

2079
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,710
string left
um cool and when i said from to two

2080
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
um cool and when i said from to two
 

2081
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,069
um cool and when i said from to two
actually i meant the reverse all the

2082
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
actually i meant the reverse all the
 

2083
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,910
actually i meant the reverse all the
edges go from right to left

2084
00:39:59,910 --> 00:39:59,920
edges go from right to left
 

2085
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,670
edges go from right to left
um and then what we're doing is looking

2086
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:01,680
um and then what we're doing is looking
 

2087
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,190
um and then what we're doing is looking
for the longest path in this dag

2088
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
for the longest path in this dag
 

2089
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,589
for the longest path in this dag
um longest path is maybe a problem we've

2090
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:07,599
um longest path is maybe a problem we've
 

2091
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,550
um longest path is maybe a problem we've
talked about in

2092
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:08,560
talked about in
 

2093
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,550
talked about in
problem session because it's a dag

2094
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
problem session because it's a dag
 

2095
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,309
problem session because it's a dag
well longest path is the same thing as

2096
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
well longest path is the same thing as
 

2097
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,230
well longest path is the same thing as
shortest path if you just negate all the

2098
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
shortest path if you just negate all the
 

2099
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,790
shortest path if you just negate all the
weights

2100
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:16,800
weights
 

2101
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,790
weights
there are no weights in this picture so

2102
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:18,800
there are no weights in this picture so
 

2103
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,309
there are no weights in this picture so
if you just put negative one

2104
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:20,319
if you just put negative one
 

2105
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,150
if you just put negative one
on all these edges and ask for the

2106
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
on all these edges and ask for the
 

2107
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,990
on all these edges and ask for the
shortest path

2108
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
shortest path
 

2109
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,109
shortest path
from the base

2110
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:27,119
from the base
 

2111
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,589
from the base
to anywhere so single source shortest

2112
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
to anywhere so single source shortest
 

2113
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,910
to anywhere so single source shortest
paths from this base

2114
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:31,920
paths from this base
 

2115
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,150
paths from this base
then we would end up getting this path

2116
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
then we would end up getting this path
 

2117
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,430
then we would end up getting this path
which if you look at it is e m p

2118
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,440
which if you look at it is e m p
 

2119
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,550
which if you look at it is e m p
t y empty and so that

2120
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:42,560
t y empty and so that
 

2121
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,550
t y empty and so that
uh shortest path is indeed the right

2122
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:44,560
uh shortest path is indeed the right
 

2123
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,829
uh shortest path is indeed the right
answer what i've drawn here is the

2124
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
answer what i've drawn here is the
 

2125
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,270
answer what i've drawn here is the
shortest path tree

2126
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,280
shortest path tree
 

2127
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,950
shortest path tree
so also if you wanted the longest

2128
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
so also if you wanted the longest
 

2129
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,390
so also if you wanted the longest
increasing subsequence starting at

2130
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:50,400
increasing subsequence starting at
 

2131
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,470
increasing subsequence starting at
a then it is a t y just by following

2132
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,480
a then it is a t y just by following
 

2133
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,589
a then it is a t y just by following
the red arrows here and how do you get

2134
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
the red arrows here and how do you get
 

2135
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,470
the red arrows here and how do you get
that you just

2136
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,480
that you just
 

2137
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,990
that you just
draw the parent pointers just like we

2138
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,000
draw the parent pointers just like we
 

2139
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,589
draw the parent pointers just like we
did before i didn't mention

2140
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:01,599
did before i didn't mention
 

2141
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,069
did before i didn't mention
this example can also be solved with

2142
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
this example can also be solved with
 

2143
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,990
this example can also be solved with
shortest paths once i'd construct this

2144
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
shortest paths once i'd construct this
 

2145
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,829
shortest paths once i'd construct this
graph you can do the shortest path from

2146
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:09,839
graph you can do the shortest path from
 

2147
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,430
graph you can do the shortest path from
some base i don't know which one

2148
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:13,440
some base i don't know which one
 

2149
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,109
some base i don't know which one
to here if you put

2150
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
to here if you put
 

2151
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,910
to here if you put
negative one on all of the diagonal

2152
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
negative one on all of the diagonal
 

2153
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,950
negative one on all of the diagonal
edges

2154
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:20,960
edges
 

2155
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,349
edges
and you put weight zero everywhere else

2156
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:23,359
and you put weight zero everywhere else
 

2157
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,430
and you put weight zero everywhere else
then that corresponds to

2158
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
then that corresponds to
 

2159
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,190
then that corresponds to
the shortest path in that graph will

2160
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,200
the shortest path in that graph will
 

2161
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,870
the shortest path in that graph will
correspond to the longest

2162
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:28,880
correspond to the longest
 

2163
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,710
correspond to the longest
the path with the most diagonal edges

2164
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
the path with the most diagonal edges
 

2165
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,829
the path with the most diagonal edges
and that makes sense because the

2166
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:31,839
and that makes sense because the
 

2167
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,670
and that makes sense because the
diagonal edges are where we actually get

2168
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
diagonal edges are where we actually get
 

2169
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,150
diagonal edges are where we actually get
letters in common and so in this case

2170
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
letters in common and so in this case
 

2171
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,870
letters in common and so in this case
it's

2172
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
it's
 

2173
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,510
it's
two so both of these dynamic programs

2174
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
two so both of these dynamic programs
 

2175
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,470
two so both of these dynamic programs
could instead

2176
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:40,480
could instead
 

2177
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,230
could instead
instead of writing them as a recursive

2178
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,240
instead of writing them as a recursive
 

2179
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,910
instead of writing them as a recursive
thing with memorization

2180
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:43,920
thing with memorization
 

2181
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,870
thing with memorization
or writing them bottom up as a for loop

2182
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:46,880
or writing them bottom up as a for loop
 

2183
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,069
or writing them bottom up as a for loop
and then

2184
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:48,079
and then
 

2185
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,829
and then
doing the computation you could instead

2186
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:49,839
doing the computation you could instead
 

2187
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,349
doing the computation you could instead
construct a graph

2188
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:51,359
construct a graph
 

2189
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,950
construct a graph
and then run dag shortest paths on it

2190
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:54,960
and then run dag shortest paths on it
 

2191
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,710
and then run dag shortest paths on it
but the point is these are the same

2192
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:56,720
but the point is these are the same
 

2193
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,790
but the point is these are the same
thing it's actually a lot simpler to

2194
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
thing it's actually a lot simpler to
 

2195
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,150
thing it's actually a lot simpler to
write the dynamic programming code

2196
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,160
write the dynamic programming code
 

2197
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,150
write the dynamic programming code
because it's just a for loop and then a

2198
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,160
because it's just a for loop and then a
 

2199
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,950
because it's just a for loop and then a
recurrence which you're just updating an

2200
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:04,960
recurrence which you're just updating an
 

2201
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,589
recurrence which you're just updating an
array

2202
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:05,599
array
 

2203
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,750
array
you don't because you already know what

2204
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:07,760
you don't because you already know what
 

2205
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,870
you don't because you already know what
the

2206
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
the
 

2207
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,710
the
topological order is you don't have to

2208
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,720
topological order is you don't have to
 

2209
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,550
topological order is you don't have to
write a generic

2210
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
write a generic
 

2211
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,470
write a generic
depth first search algorithm take the

2212
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,480

2213
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,790

00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
finishing order reverse it
 

2215
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,030
finishing order reverse it
and then run this

2216
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,040
and then run this
 

2217
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,470
and then run this
run dag shortest paths with relaxation

run dag shortest paths with relaxation
 

2219
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,790
run dag shortest paths with relaxation
uh much simpler to just write down the

2220
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:26,800
uh much simpler to just write down the
 

2221
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,870
uh much simpler to just write down the
recurrence once you've figured it out

2222
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:28,880
recurrence once you've figured it out
 

2223
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,710
recurrence once you've figured it out
okay but they are the same in these

2224
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
okay but they are the same in these
 

2225
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,270
okay but they are the same in these
examples uh in fibonacci for example you

2226
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
examples uh in fibonacci for example you
 

2227
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,790
examples uh in fibonacci for example you
cannot write fibonacci as a single

2228
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:34,800
cannot write fibonacci as a single
 

2229
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,230
cannot write fibonacci as a single
source shortest path problem but a lot

you can write as the shortest paths

2234
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,800
you can write as the shortest paths
 

2235
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,109
you can write as the shortest paths

2245
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,230

week

2246
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,240

 

2247
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,230

alternating coin game this is a two

2248
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:04,240
alternating coin game this is a two
 

2249
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,430
alternating coin game this is a two
player game

2250
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:05,440
player game
 

2251
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,950
player game
we're gonna find the optimal strategy in

2252
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
we're gonna find the optimal strategy in
 

2253
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,550
we're gonna find the optimal strategy in
this game uh

2254
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:08,560
this game uh
 

2255
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,950
this game uh
so an example is in general you have a

2256
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:10,960
so an example is in general you have a
 

2257
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,589
so an example is in general you have a
sequence of coins

2258
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:17,599

 

2259
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,630

and we have two players

2260
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,640
and we have two players
 

2261
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,349
and we have two players
they take turns so given

2262
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359

 

2263
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,790

coins of

2264
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
coins of
 

2265
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,950
coins of
value uh v zero

2266
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:32,960
value uh v zero
 

2267
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,990
value uh v zero
to v n minus one so it's a it's a

2268
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
to v n minus one so it's a it's a
 

2269
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,790
to v n minus one so it's a it's a
sequence

2270
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800

 

2271
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,829

they're given an order in some order

2272
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:43,839

 

2273
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,309

for example 5 10 125 not necessarily

2274
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
for example 5 10 125 not necessarily
 

2275
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,349
for example 5 10 125 not necessarily
sorted order

2276
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:47,359
sorted order
 

2277
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,710
sorted order
and the rules of the game are we're

2278
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
and the rules of the game are we're
 

2279
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,950
and the rules of the game are we're
going to take turns i'm going to take

2280
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:50,960
going to take turns i'm going to take
 

2281
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,829
going to take turns i'm going to take
turns with you

2282
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
turns with you
 

2283
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,150
turns with you
i'm going to use i and u to refer to the

2284
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,160
i'm going to use i and u to refer to the
 

2285
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,309
i'm going to use i and u to refer to the
two players

2286
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:56,319
two players
 

2287
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,430
two players
and so in each turn either one whoever's

2288
00:43:59,430 --> 00:43:59,440
and so in each turn either one whoever's
 

2289
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,230
and so in each turn either one whoever's
turn it is

2290
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,240
turn it is
 

2291
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,470
turn it is
i get to we get to choose either the

2292
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
i get to we get to choose either the
 

2293
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,270
i get to we get to choose either the
first coin

2294
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
first coin
 

2295
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,109
first coin
or the last coin among the coins that

2296
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
or the last coin among the coins that
 

2297
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,670
or the last coin among the coins that
remain so at the beginning i can choose

2298
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680
remain so at the beginning i can choose
 

2299
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,349
remain so at the beginning i can choose
5 or 25 and i might think

2300
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
5 or 25 and i might think
 

2301
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,670
5 or 25 and i might think
oh 25 is really good that's better than

2302
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
oh 25 is really good that's better than
 

2303
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,710
oh 25 is really good that's better than
5. i should choose that

2304
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:12,720
5. i should choose that
 

2305
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,309
5. i should choose that
but then of course you're you're going

2306
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
but then of course you're you're going
 

2307
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,470
but then of course you're you're going
next and you're going to choose 100

2308
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:16,480
next and you're going to choose 100
 

2309
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,309
next and you're going to choose 100
and you'll win the game you'll get more

2310
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:18,319
and you'll win the game you'll get more
 

2311
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,390
and you'll win the game you'll get more
of the total value of the coins

2312
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
of the total value of the coins
 

2313
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,230
of the total value of the coins
so in this example a better strategy is

2314
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
so in this example a better strategy is
 

2315
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,750
so in this example a better strategy is
to take the five

2316
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:23,760
to take the five
 

2317
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,670
to take the five
because then the hundred is still in the

2318
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
because then the hundred is still in the
 

2319
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,510
because then the hundred is still in the
middle and so once once i take

2320
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
middle and so once once i take
 

2321
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,630
middle and so once once i take
five uh you get to choose

2322
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
five uh you get to choose
 

2323
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,950
five uh you get to choose
10 or 25 at this point you probably

2324
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
10 or 25 at this point you probably
 

2325
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,430
10 or 25 at this point you probably
prefer 25 because that's better than 10

2326
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,440
prefer 25 because that's better than 10
 

2327
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,510
prefer 25 because that's better than 10
but whichever you choose i can take the

2328
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:37,520
but whichever you choose i can take the
 

2329
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,230
but whichever you choose i can take the
100 and so i get 105 points

2330
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,240
100 and so i get 105 points
 

2331
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,430
100 and so i get 105 points
and you're going to get 35 points

2332
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:43,440
and you're going to get 35 points
 

2333
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,470
and you're going to get 35 points
okay good good example for me um

2334
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:46,480
okay good good example for me um
 

2335
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,150
okay good good example for me um
and what we're going to do so that's

2336
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:48,160
and what we're going to do so that's
 

2337
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,710
and what we're going to do so that's
easy for a simple example but

2338
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,720
easy for a simple example but
 

2339
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,069
easy for a simple example but
in general there are exponentially many

2340
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
in general there are exponentially many
 

2341
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,990
in general there are exponentially many
strategies here at each step either of

2342
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
strategies here at each step either of
 

2343
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,589
strategies here at each step either of

00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
i didn't mention so this algorithm is
 

2355
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,670
i didn't mention so this algorithm is
quadratic time but it can be made n log

we've done you can make this n log n

2364
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:17,599
we've done you can make this n log n
 

2365
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,870
we've done you can make this n log n
this algorithm i think is going to be n

2366
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:20,880
this algorithm i think is going to be n

2369
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,069

so i won't write the problem

2370
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:30,079
so i won't write the problem
 

2371
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,990
so i won't write the problem
exactly but i think you know the rules

2372
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
exactly but i think you know the rules

so i'd like to define some

2378
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,280
so i'd like to define some
 

2379
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,190
so i'd like to define some
sub problems and this is a problem

2389
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,470
would deal great with if i'm
deleting coins from the left but as soon

2390
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:50,480
deleting coins from the left but as soon
 

2391
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,910

00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
delete coins only from the right that
 

2395
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,950
delete coins only from the right that
would give me prefixes

2396
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:54,960
would give me prefixes
 

2397
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,270
would give me prefixes
but i'll tell you now there's no dynamic

2398
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:57,280
but i'll tell you now there's no dynamic
 

2399
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,710
but i'll tell you now there's no dynamic
programming where the answer is

00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:58,720
programming where the answer is
 

2401
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,870

suffixes and prefixes you can do

2402
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:00,880
suffixes and prefixes you can do
 

2403
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,790
suffixes and prefixes you can do
suffixes or prefixes but if you need

2404
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
suffixes or prefixes but if you need
 

2405
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,589
suffixes or prefixes but if you need
both

2406
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:03,599
both
 

2407
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,990
both
you almost certainly need substrings

2408
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,000
you almost certainly need substrings
 

2409
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,589
you almost certainly need substrings
because as soon as i delete

2410
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:07,599
because as soon as i delete
 

2411
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,990
because as soon as i delete
the first coin and then maybe you take

2412
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,000
the first coin and then maybe you take
 

2413
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,589
the first coin and then maybe you take
the second coin

2414
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:11,599
the second coin
 

2415
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,349
the second coin
that's exactly the optimal strategy here

2416
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:13,359
that's exactly the optimal strategy here
 

2417
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,030
that's exactly the optimal strategy here
now you have an arbitrary substring in

2418
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,040
now you have an arbitrary substring in
 

2419
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:15,829
now you have an arbitrary substring in
the middle

2420
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
the middle
 

2421
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,190
the middle
okay but substrings are enough because

2422
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200
okay but substrings are enough because
 

2423
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,950
okay but substrings are enough because
we're only deleting from the ends

2424
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
we're only deleting from the ends
 

2425
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,349
we're only deleting from the ends
we'll look at substrings

2426
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:23,359

 

2427
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,829

so more precisely this is just the

2428
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:25,839
so more precisely this is just the
 

2429
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,190
so more precisely this is just the
intuition

2430
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
intuition
 

2431
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,870

2435
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,270
of i j is going to be what
is the maximum

2436
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280

00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,000

 

2439
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,109

i can get

2440
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:47,119

 

2441
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,190

uh from this game uh if we play it on

2442
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
uh from this game uh if we play it on
 

2443
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,790
uh from this game uh if we play it on
coins uh of value

2444
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
coins uh of value
 

2445
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,829

vi

2446
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:01,839

 

2447
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:07,190

to vj so that's a substring

2448
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,200
to vj so that's a substring
 

2449
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,270
to vj so that's a substring
so this is one way to write down the sub

2450
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
so this is one way to write down the sub
 

2451
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,990
so this is one way to write down the sub
problems and is also

2452
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:12,000
problems and is also
 

2453
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,470
problems and is also
a good way i mean you can write down a

2454
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:14,480
a good way i mean you can write down a
 

2455
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,430
a good way i mean you can write down a
relation

2456

the game is zero sum
 

2469
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,510
the game is zero sum
but i'd like to uh change this a little

2470
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:31,520
but i'd like to uh change this a little
 

2471
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,150

which is to add a third coordinate
to my sub-problems so now it's

take the first coin for example

2516
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:22,319
take the first coin for example
 

2517
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,670
take the first coin for example
it's now your turn and so i don't really

2518
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
it's now your turn and so i don't really
 

2519
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,390
it's now your turn and so i don't really
want to

2520
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:26,400
want to
 

2521
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,309
want to
know the maximum total value that i

2522
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
know the maximum total value that i
 

2523
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,710
know the maximum total value that i
would get if i go first

2524
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
would get if i go first
 

2525
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,990
would get if i go first
i'd like to say uh

2526
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
i'd like to say uh
 

2527
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,589
i'd like to say uh
if player p goes first i'd really like

2528
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:37,599
if player p goes first i'd really like
 

2529
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,710
if player p goes first i'd really like
to know

2530
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
to know
 

2531
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,549
to know
what what happens in the case where you

2532
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:40,559
what what happens in the case where you
 

2533
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,470
what what happens in the case where you
go first

2534
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,480
go first
 

2535
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,990
go first
and so for some of the uh substrings i

2536
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,000
and so for some of the uh substrings i
 

2537
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,349
and so for some of the uh substrings i
want to know what happens when you go

2538
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:47,359
want to know what happens when you go
 

2539
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,990
want to know what happens when you go
first and for

2540
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
first and for
 

2541
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,190
first and for
some of them i want to know what happens

2542
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:49,200
some of them i want to know what happens
 

2543
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,870
some of them i want to know what happens
when i go first because as soon as i

2544
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:50,880
when i go first because as soon as i
 

2545
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,670
when i go first because as soon as i
make a move

2546
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:51,680
make a move
 

2547
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,950
make a move
it's your turn and so we're going to

2548
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:52,960
it's your turn and so we're going to
 

2549
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,710
it's your turn and so we're going to
flip back and forth between p

2550
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:54,720
flip back and forth between p
 

2551
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,349
flip back and forth between p
being me and p being u p u

2552
00:48:59,349 --> 00:48:59,359
being me and p being u p u
 

2553
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,990
being me and p being u p u
so you don't have to parameterize this

2554
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,000
so you don't have to parameterize this
 

2555
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,190
so you don't have to parameterize this
there's a way to write the recurrence

2556
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,200
there's a way to write the recurrence
 

2557
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,150
there's a way to write the recurrence
otherwise but

2558
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:04,160
otherwise but
 

2559
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,230
otherwise but
this is i think a lot more intuitive

2560
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:06,240
this is i think a lot more intuitive
 

2561
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,549
this is i think a lot more intuitive
because now we can do

2562
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
because now we can do
 

2563
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,870
because now we can do
a very simple relation

2564
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880

 

2565
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,069

which is as follows

2566
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:16,079
which is as follows
 

2567
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,549
which is as follows
so i'm going to split into two cases one

2568
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:18,559
so i'm going to split into two cases one
 

2569
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,589
so i'm going to split into two cases one
is x of i j

2570
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
is x of i j
 

2571
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,190
is x of i j
me and the other is x of i j u

2572
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200

 

2573
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,870

uh so x of i j me so i have

2574
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,880
uh so x of i j me so i have
 

2575
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,549
uh so x of i j me so i have
i have some substring from i to j

2576
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
i have some substring from i to j
 

2577
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,190
i have some substring from i to j
uh what could i do i could take the

2578
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
uh what could i do i could take the
 

2579
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,549
uh what could i do i could take the
first coin or i could take the second

2580
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:36,559
first coin or i could take the second
 

2581
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,430
first coin or i could take the second
coin

2582
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
coin
 

2583
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,270
coin
what should i do that's my question

2584
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,280
what should i do that's my question
 

2585
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,030
what should i do that's my question
should what is my first move

2586
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
should what is my first move
 

2587
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,630
should what is my first move
should i take the first coin or the

2588
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:42,640
should i take the first coin or the
 

2589
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,670
should i take the first coin or the
second coin so this is my question

2590
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:45,680
second coin so this is my question
 

2591
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,870
second coin so this is my question
what is the first move

2592
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:50,880

 

2593
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,870

there are exactly two possible answers

2594
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:52,880
there are exactly two possible answers
 

2595
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,470
there are exactly two possible answers
to that question so we can afford to

2596
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
to that question so we can afford to
 

2597
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,829
to that question so we can afford to
just brute force them

2598
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
just brute force them
 

2599
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,109
just brute force them
and take the max

2600
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
and take the max
 

2601
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,150
and take the max
for moving we want the maximum

2602
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,160
for moving we want the maximum
 

2603
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,829
for moving we want the maximum
number of points we can get maximum

2604
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
number of points we can get maximum
 

2605
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,990
number of points we can get maximum
total value of

2606
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
total value of
 

2607
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,950
total value of
the two choices so if if i take from the

2608
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:08,960
the two choices so if if i take from the
 

2609
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,710
the two choices so if if i take from the
i side the left side

2610
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,720
i side the left side
 

2611
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,549
i side the left side
that would be x of i plus one j

2612
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
that would be x of i plus one j
 

2613
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,510
that would be x of i plus one j
uh sorry and now crucially we flip

2614
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:17,520
uh sorry and now crucially we flip
 

2615
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,950
uh sorry and now crucially we flip
players because then it's your turn

2616
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:20,960
players because then it's your turn
 

2617
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,870
players because then it's your turn
and if i take from the j side that will

2618
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880
and if i take from the j side that will
 

2619
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,109
and if i take from the j side that will
make it j minus one

2620
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:25,119
make it j minus one
 

2621
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,549
make it j minus one
this is what i accidentally wrote at the

2622
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:26,559
this is what i accidentally wrote at the
 

2623
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,589
this is what i accidentally wrote at the
beginning of lecture

2624
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599

 

2625
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,630

also flipped players so either i shrink

2626
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:34,640
also flipped players so either i shrink
 

2627
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,390
also flipped players so either i shrink
on the i side or a shrink on the j side

2628
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
on the i side or a shrink on the j side
 

2629
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,069
on the i side or a shrink on the j side
oh i should add on

2630
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:38,079
oh i should add on
 

2631
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,430
oh i should add on
here the value of the coin that i get

2632
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:41,440
here the value of the coin that i get
 

2633
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,309
here the value of the coin that i get
and add on the value of the coin that i

2634
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:44,319
and add on the value of the coin that i
 

2635
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,270
and add on the value of the coin that i
took

2636
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:45,280
took
 

2637
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,990
took
sorry these are this is a an expression

2638
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,000
sorry these are this is a an expression
 

2639
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,750
sorry these are this is a an expression
inside the max

2640
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,760
inside the max
 

2641
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,790
inside the max
that sum okay and if i take the max

2642
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:52,800
that sum okay and if i take the max
 

2643
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,230

00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,240
those two options that will give
 

2645
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,630

choice

2648
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
choice
 

2649
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,150
choice
of how many how what are the total value

00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,160
of how many how what are the total value
 

2651
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,230
of how many how what are the total value
of coins i will get out of the remainder

00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:02,240
of coins i will get out of the remainder
 

2653
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,470
of coins i will get out of the remainder
given that you start plus this coin that

2654
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:04,480
given that you start plus this coin that
 

2655
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,549

i took right now in the first step
 

2657
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,309
i took right now in the first step
and for the two possible choices of what

2658
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
and for the two possible choices of what
 

2659
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,589

that coin is
okay what remains is how do we how do we

2662
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:11,680
okay what remains is how do we how do we
 

2663
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,030
okay what remains is how do we how do we
define this x of i j

2664
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,040
define this x of i j
 

2665
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,109
define this x of i j
u this is a little bit funnier

2666
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:17,119
u this is a little bit funnier
 

2667
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,950
u this is a little bit funnier
but it's conceptually similar i'm going

2668
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:18,960
but it's conceptually similar i'm going
 

2669
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,230
but it's conceptually similar i'm going
to write

2670
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:20,240
to write
 

2671
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,230
to write
basically the same thing here but with a

00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,240
basically the same thing here but with a
 

2673
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,030

00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,040
me
 

2675
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,549
me
instead of a u because again it flips

2676
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:30,559

 

2677
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,549

this is if you go first then the very

2678
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:32,559
this is if you go first then the very
 

2679
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,950
this is if you go first then the very
next move will be me

2680
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:34,960
next move will be me
 

2681
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,150
next move will be me
okay so this is just the symmetric

2682
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:40,160

 

2683
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,309

formula here i can even put the braces

2684
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:44,319
formula here i can even put the braces
 

2685
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,510
formula here i can even put the braces
in

2686
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:45,520
in
 

2687
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,549
in
so far the same now

2688
00:51:48,549 --> 00:51:48,559
so far the same now
 

2689
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,190
so far the same now
i don't put in the plus vi and i don't

2690
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
i don't put in the plus vi and i don't
 

2691
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,710
i don't put in the plus vi and i don't
put in the plus vj here because if

2692
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:52,720
put in the plus vj here because if
 

2693
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,950
put in the plus vj here because if
you're moving i don't get those points

2694
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
you're moving i don't get those points
 

2695
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,150
you're moving i don't get those points
so there's an asymmetry in this

2696
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
so there's an asymmetry in this
 

2697
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,270
so there's an asymmetry in this
definition you could define it in

2698
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,280
definition you could define it in
 

2699
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,230
definition you could define it in
different ways but

2700
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:58,240
different ways but
 

2701
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,069
different ways but
this is the maximum total value that i

2702
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:00,079
this is the maximum total value that i
 

2703
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,309
this is the maximum total value that i
would get if you start

2704
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,319
would get if you start
 

2705
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,630
would get if you start
so in your first move you get some

2706
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:04,640
so in your first move you get some
 

2707
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,150
so in your first move you get some
points but i don't get any points out of

2708
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,160
points but i don't get any points out of
 

2709
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,710
points but i don't get any points out of
that

2710
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:06,720
that
 

2711
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,430
that
so there's no plus vi there's no plus vj

2712
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
so there's no plus vi there's no plus vj
 

2713
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,230
so there's no plus vi there's no plus vj
it's just

2714
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:10,240
it's just
 

2715
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,910
it's just
you either choose the ith coin or you

2716
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:11,920
you either choose the ith coin or you
 

2717
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,670
you either choose the ith coin or you
choose the jth coin and then the coins

2718
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,680
choose the jth coin and then the coins
 

2719
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,390
choose the jth coin and then the coins
that remain

2720
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:14,400
that remain
 

2721
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,549
that remain
for me shrink accordingly now

2722
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:18,559
for me shrink accordingly now
 

2723
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,910
for me shrink accordingly now
you're kind of a pain in the ass you're

2724
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:19,920
you're kind of a pain in the ass you're
 

2725
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,910
you're kind of a pain in the ass you're
an adversary you're trying to minimize

2726
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:21,920
an adversary you're trying to minimize
 

2727
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,710
an adversary you're trying to minimize
my score

2728
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
my score
 

2729
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,470
my score
potentially because you're trying to

2730
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:24,480
potentially because you're trying to
 

2731
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,390
potentially because you're trying to
maximize your score this is a zero-sum

2732
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:26,400
maximize your score this is a zero-sum
 

2733
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,230
maximize your score this is a zero-sum
game so everything that you get i don't

2734
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,240
game so everything that you get i don't
 

2735
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:28,790
game so everything that you get i don't
get

2736
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:28,800
get
 

2737
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,630
get
so you want to maximize your score if

2738
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:30,640
so you want to maximize your score if
 

2739
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,750
so you want to maximize your score if
you want to maximize your score you're

2740
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:31,760
you want to maximize your score you're
 

2741
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,030
you want to maximize your score you're
trying to minimize my score these are

2742
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:33,040
trying to minimize my score these are
 

2743
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,150
trying to minimize my score these are
symmetric things

2744
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,160
symmetric things
 

2745
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,710
symmetric things
and so if you think for a while the

2746
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
and so if you think for a while the
 

2747
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,870
and so if you think for a while the
right thing to put here is min

2748
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:38,880
right thing to put here is min
 

2749
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,549
right thing to put here is min
from our perspective we're imagining

2750
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
from our perspective we're imagining
 

2751
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,790
from our perspective we're imagining
what is the worst case that could happen

2752
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
what is the worst case that could happen
 

2753
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,309
what is the worst case that could happen
no matter what you do and we don't have

2754
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
no matter what you do and we don't have
 

2755
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:47,990
no matter what you do and we don't have
control over what you do

2756
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
control over what you do
 

2757
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,030
control over what you do
and so we'd really like to see what

2758
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,040
and so we'd really like to see what
 

2759
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,390
and so we'd really like to see what
score would i get if you chose the

2760
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
score would i get if you chose the
 

2761
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,430
score would i get if you chose the
ithcoin what

2762
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:53,440
ithcoin what
 

2763
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,589
ithcoin what
score do you get if if you chose the jth

2764
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:55,599
score do you get if if you chose the jth
 

2765
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,270
score do you get if if you chose the jth
coin

2766
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,280
coin
 

2767
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,430
coin
and then what we get is going to be the

2768
00:52:59,430 --> 00:52:59,440
and then what we get is going to be the
 

2769
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,069
and then what we get is going to be the
worst of those two possibilities

2770
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079
worst of those two possibilities
 

2771
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,910
worst of those two possibilities
so when we get to choose we're

2772
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:03,920
so when we get to choose we're
 

2773
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,510
so when we get to choose we're
maximizing and this is a general

2774
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:05,520
maximizing and this is a general
 

2775
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,790
maximizing and this is a general
two-player phenomenon

2776
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:06,800
two-player phenomenon
 

2777
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,870
two-player phenomenon
that when you choose we end up

2778
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:08,880
that when you choose we end up
 

2779
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,309
that when you choose we end up
minimizing because that's the saddest

2780
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:10,319
minimizing because that's the saddest
 

2781
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,710

2782
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:12,720

2783
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,750

okay this is one way to write a

2784
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
okay this is one way to write a
 

2785
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,190
okay this is one way to write a
recurrence relation

2786
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
recurrence relation
 

2787
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,829
recurrence relation
um we have of course

2788
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:23,839

 

2789
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,309

all of sort bot to do so the topological

00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
all of sort bot to do so the topological
 

2791
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,030
all of sort bot to do so the topological
order here is in

2792
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
order here is in
 

2793
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,150
order here is in
increasing length of substrings so the t

2794
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:32,160
increasing length of substrings so the t
 

2795
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,589
increasing length of substrings so the t
is increasing j minus i

2796
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:35,599
is increasing j minus i
 

2797
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,549
is increasing j minus i
start with empty strings so base case is

2798
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
start with empty strings so base case is
 

2799
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,589
start with empty strings so base case is
that

2800
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599

uh so there is a coin i can take at the

2810
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
uh so there is a coin i can take at the
 

2811
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,829
uh so there is a coin i can take at the
end but if you move last and there's one

2812
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:53,839
end but if you move last and there's one
 

2813
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,190
end but if you move last and there's one
coin left then i don't get it

2814
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,200
coin left then i don't get it
 

2815
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,910
coin left then i don't get it
so it's zero then we have the original

2816
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:57,920
so it's zero then we have the original
 

2817
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,510
so it's zero then we have the original
problem that is

2818
00:53:59,510 --> 00:53:59,520
problem that is
 

2819
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,870
problem that is
x i j me sorry

x i j me sorry
 

2821
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,230
x i j me sorry
x zero n that's the

2822
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,240
x zero n that's the
 

2823
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,829
x zero n that's the
entire coin set starting with me that

2824
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
entire coin set starting with me that
 

2825
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,510
entire coin set starting with me that
was the problem i wanted to do

2826
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:09,520
was the problem i wanted to do
 

2827
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,990
was the problem i wanted to do
and then the running time we get is the

2828
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
and then the running time we get is the
 

2829
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,829
and then the running time we get is the
number of sub problems that's theta n

2830
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:13,839
number of sub problems that's theta n
 

2831
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,870
number of sub problems that's theta n
squared

2832
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:14,880
squared
 

2833
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,510
squared
because we're doing substrings times the

2834
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:17,520
because we're doing substrings times the
 

2835
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,750
because we're doing substrings times the
amount of non-recursive work i do here

that's just a max of two numbers very

2838
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:21,440
that's just a max of two numbers very
 

2839
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,109
that's just a max of two numbers very
simple constant time

2840
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
simple constant time
 

2841
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,950
simple constant time
so this is quadratic

2842
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960

 

2843
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,710

let me show you an example

2844
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:34,720

 

2845
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,349

this is hard to draw but what i've

2846
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
this is hard to draw but what i've
 

2847
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,950
this is hard to draw but what i've
described here is called solution two in

2848
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
described here is called solution two in
 

2849
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,069
described here is called solution two in
the notes

2850
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,079
the notes
 

2851
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,589
the notes
um so here's our sequence 510 125 in

2852
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:43,599
um so here's our sequence 510 125 in
 

2853
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:44,390
um so here's our sequence 510 125 in
both

2854
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
both
 

2855
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,309
both
directions and what we're interested in

2856
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:46,319
directions and what we're interested in
 

2857
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,549
directions and what we're interested in
is all sub strings so

2858
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:48,559
is all sub strings so
 

2859
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,870
is all sub strings so
over here i've written the choice for i

2860
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880
over here i've written the choice for i
 

2861
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,950
over here i've written the choice for i
so we start at one of these and if you

2862
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:54,960
so we start at one of these and if you
 

2863
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,990
so we start at one of these and if you
start here

2864
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,000
start here
 

2865
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,990
start here
you can't end earlier than there so

2866
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
you can't end earlier than there so
 

2867
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,510
you can't end earlier than there so
that's why we're in the upper upper

2868
00:54:59,510 --> 00:54:59,520
that's why we're in the upper upper
 

2869
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,109
that's why we're in the upper upper
diagonal of this matrix

2870
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:01,119
diagonal of this matrix
 

2871
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,190
diagonal of this matrix
and then there's two versions of each

2872
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:03,200
and then there's two versions of each
 

2873
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,630
and then there's two versions of each
problem the white version and the blue

2874
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:04,640
problem the white version and the blue
 

2875
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,150
problem the white version and the blue
version just down and to the right of it

2876
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:06,160
version just down and to the right of it
 

2877
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,670
version just down and to the right of it
if you can't see what blue is

2878
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:07,680
if you can't see what blue is
 

2879
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,670
if you can't see what blue is
this is the version where you start this

2880
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:09,680
this is the version where you start this
 

2881
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,670
this is the version where you start this
is the version where i start

2882
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:11,680
is the version where i start
 

2883
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,270
is the version where i start
and i've labeled here all of the

2884
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:13,280
and i've labeled here all of the
 

2885
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,789
and i've labeled here all of the
different numbers please

2886
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:14,799
different numbers please
 

2887
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,230
different numbers please
admire because this took a long time to

2888
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
admire because this took a long time to
 

2889
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,349
admire because this took a long time to
draw but in particular we have 105 here

2890
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:19,359
draw but in particular we have 105 here
 

2891
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,870
draw but in particular we have 105 here
meaning that the maximum points i can

2892
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:20,880
meaning that the maximum points i can
 

2893
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,349
meaning that the maximum points i can
get

2894
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:21,359
get
 

2895
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,870
get
105 and that's the case because

2896
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:24,880
105 and that's the case because
 

2897
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,670
105 and that's the case because
if we look over there it is the max of

2898
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:27,680
if we look over there it is the max of
 

2899
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,870
if we look over there it is the max of
these two

2900
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
these two
 

2901
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,990
these two
incoming values

2902
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:32,000
incoming values
 

2903
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,270
incoming values
plus the vi that i get so either i go to

2904
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,280
plus the vi that i get so either i go to
 

2905
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,710
plus the vi that i get so either i go to
the left and i take that

2906
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
the left and i take that
 

2907
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,870
the left and i take that
item or i go down and i take that item

2908
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:40,880
item or i go down and i take that item
 

2909
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,230
item or i go down and i take that item
so the option here is i went

2910
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
so the option here is i went
 

2911
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,549
so the option here is i went
to the left and took well that's going

2912
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:48,559
to the left and took well that's going
 

2913
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,150
to the left and took well that's going
to be tricky to do

2914
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,160
to be tricky to do
 

2915
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,069
to be tricky to do
in time the claim is that the the best

2916
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
in time the claim is that the the best
 

2917
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,069
in time the claim is that the the best
answer here is to go here with the

2918
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
answer here is to go here with the
 

2919
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:54,950
answer here is to go here with the
hundred

2920
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:54,960
hundred
 

2921
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,150
hundred
and take the five uh because going down

2922
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,160
and take the five uh because going down
 

2923
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,390
and take the five uh because going down
corresponds to removing the last item

2924
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:00,400
corresponds to removing the last item
 

2925
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,150
corresponds to removing the last item
if i went to the left that corresponds

2926
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:02,160
if i went to the left that corresponds
 

2927
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,910
if i went to the left that corresponds
to remove sorry the first item

2928
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
to remove sorry the first item
 

2929
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,270
to remove sorry the first item
if i went to the left that corresponds

2930
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
if i went to the left that corresponds
 

2931
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,190
if i went to the left that corresponds
to removing the last item so my options

2932
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
to removing the last item so my options
 

2933
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,510
to removing the last item so my options
are

2934
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:07,520
are
 

2935
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,069
are
10 plus 25 which is 35 versus

2936
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:12,079
10 plus 25 which is 35 versus
 

2937
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,190
10 plus 25 which is 35 versus
100 plus 5 105 wins

2938
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
100 plus 5 105 wins
 

2939
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,109
100 plus 5 105 wins
so that's why there's a red edge here

2940
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:17,119
so that's why there's a red edge here
 

2941
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,270
so that's why there's a red edge here
showing that was my better choice

2942
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,280
showing that was my better choice
 

2943
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,270
showing that was my better choice
and in general if you follow the these

2944
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:21,280
and in general if you follow the these
 

2945
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,950
and in general if you follow the these
parent pointers back it gives you the

2946
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
parent pointers back it gives you the
 

2947
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,390
parent pointers back it gives you the
optimal strategy

2948
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:24,400
optimal strategy
 

2949
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,470
optimal strategy
in what you should do first you should

2950
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,480
in what you should do first you should
 

2951
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,069
in what you should do first you should
take the five is what this is saying

2952
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
take the five is what this is saying
 

2953
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,430
take the five is what this is saying
because we just clipped off

2954
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
because we just clipped off
 

2955
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,510
because we just clipped off
the five we used to start here and now

2956
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,520
the five we used to start here and now
 

2957
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,470
the five we used to start here and now
we start here

2958
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:32,480
we start here
 

2959
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,510
we start here
in this sub interval then

2960
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:35,520
in this sub interval then
 

2961
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,750
in this sub interval then
our opponent to be annoying we'll take

2962
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
our opponent to be annoying we'll take
 

2963
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,109
our opponent to be annoying we'll take
the 25

2964
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
the 25
 

2965
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,510
the 25
doesn't actually matter i think then we

2966
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:41,520
doesn't actually matter i think then we
 

2967
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,109
doesn't actually matter i think then we
will take the 100

2968
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119
will take the 100
 

2969
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,789
will take the 100
and then they take the 10 and it's game

2970
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
and then they take the 10 and it's game
 

2971
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,470
and then they take the 10 and it's game
over

2972
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:48,480
over
 

2973
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,910
over
okay all the numbers here how many

2974
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
okay all the numbers here how many
 

2975
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,670
okay all the numbers here how many
points we get doesn't say how many

2976
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:51,680
points we get doesn't say how many
 

2977
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,870
points we get doesn't say how many
points the opponent gets of course you

2978
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:52,880
points the opponent gets of course you
 

2979
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,789
points the opponent gets of course you
could add that as well

2980
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:54,799
could add that as well
 

2981
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,750
could add that as well
it's just the total sum minus minus what

2982
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:57,760
it's just the total sum minus minus what
 

2983
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:57,990
it's just the total sum minus minus what
we

2984
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
we
 

2985
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,109
we
get ah now let me come back to

2986
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:01,119
get ah now let me come back to
 

2987
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,390
get ah now let me come back to
high level here what we're really doing

2988
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:04,400
high level here what we're really doing
 

2989
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,829
high level here what we're really doing
is sub problem expansion and this is an

2990
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:07,839
is sub problem expansion and this is an
 

2991
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,390
is sub problem expansion and this is an
idea

2992
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:08,400
idea
 

2993
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:15,030
idea
that we will expand on next lecture

2994
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:15,040

 

2995
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,069

uh and the idea is that sometimes you

2996
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
uh and the idea is that sometimes you
 

2997
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,589
uh and the idea is that sometimes you
start with the obvious sub-problems of

2998
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:19,599
start with the obvious sub-problems of
 

2999
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,510
start with the obvious sub-problems of
prefixes suffixes or substrings here the

3000
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:21,520
prefixes suffixes or substrings here the
 

3001
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,870
prefixes suffixes or substrings here the
obvious version with substrings because

3002
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
obvious version with substrings because
 

3003
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,190
obvious version with substrings because
we're

3004
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
we're
 

3005
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,950
we're
removing from both ends if you don't

3006
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:24,960
removing from both ends if you don't
 

3007
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,230
removing from both ends if you don't
know probably suffixes or prefixes

3008
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:28,240
know probably suffixes or prefixes
 

3009
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,589
know probably suffixes or prefixes
are enough

3010
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:31,599

 

3011
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,109

so we start there but sometimes that's

3012
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
so we start there but sometimes that's
 

3013
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,589
so we start there but sometimes that's
still not enough sub problems

3014
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:35,599
still not enough sub problems
 

3015
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,349
still not enough sub problems
here as soon as we made a move our

3016
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
here as soon as we made a move our
 

3017
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,109
here as soon as we made a move our
problem almost turned upside down

3018
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:39,119
problem almost turned upside down
 

3019
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,710
problem almost turned upside down
because now it's your turn instead of my

3020
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
because now it's your turn instead of my
 

3021
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,430
because now it's your turn instead of my
turn

3022
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
turn
 

3023
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,349
turn
and that was just annoying to deal with

3024
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:43,359
and that was just annoying to deal with
 

3025
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,670
and that was just annoying to deal with
and so we could whenever you

3026
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:45,680
and so we could whenever you
 

3027
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,349
and so we could whenever you
run into a new type of problem just

3028
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:47,359
run into a new type of problem just
 

3029
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:48,950
run into a new type of problem just
build more sub problems as long as it

3030
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:48,960
build more sub problems as long as it
 

3031
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,470
build more sub problems as long as it
stays polynomial number

3032
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:50,480
stays polynomial number
 

3033
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,829
stays polynomial number
we'll get polynomial time and so here we

3034
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:53,839
we'll get polynomial time and so here we
 

3035
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,430
we'll get polynomial time and so here we
doubled the number of sub-problems to

3036
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
doubled the number of sub-problems to
 

3037
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,069
doubled the number of sub-problems to
just the b

3038
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:56,079
just the b
 

3039
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,670
just the b
case and the u-case and that made this

3040
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:57,680
case and the u-case and that made this
 

3041
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,030
case and the u-case and that made this
recurrence really easy to write in the

3042
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,040
recurrence really easy to write in the
 

3043
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,470
recurrence really easy to write in the
notes you'll see a messier way to write

3044
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:00,480
notes you'll see a messier way to write
 

3045
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,990
notes you'll see a messier way to write
it if you don't do that

3046
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:02,000
it if you don't do that
 

3047
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,750
it if you don't do that
in the examples we'll see next lecture

3048
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:03,760
in the examples we'll see next lecture
 

3049
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,309
in the examples we'll see next lecture
we're going to do a lot more expansion

3050
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:06,319
we're going to do a lot more expansion
 

3051
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,750
we're going to do a lot more expansion
maybe multiplying the number of sub

3052
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:07,760
maybe multiplying the number of sub
 

3053
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,750
maybe multiplying the number of sub
problems by n or n squared

3054
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
problems by n or n squared
 

3055
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,950
problems by n or n squared
and this will give us uh it will let us

3056
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:12,960
and this will give us uh it will let us
 

3057
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,950
and this will give us uh it will let us
add more constraints to our

3058
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:16,960
add more constraints to our
 

3059
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,750
add more constraints to our
sub problems like we did in longest

3060
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:19,760
sub problems like we did in longest
 

3061
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,270
sub problems like we did in longest
increasing subsequence

3062
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,280
increasing subsequence
 

3063
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,750
increasing subsequence
we added this constraint that we start

3064
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
we added this constraint that we start
 

3065
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,030
we added this constraint that we start
with a particular item

3066
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,040
with a particular item
 

3067
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,710
with a particular item
the more sub problems we have we can

3068
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,720
the more sub problems we have we can
 

3069
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,789
the more sub problems we have we can
consider more constraints because we'll

3070
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:28,799
consider more constraints because we'll
 

3071
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:29,349
consider more constraints because we'll
just

3072
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:29,359
just
 

3073
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,190
just
brute force all the possible constraints

3074
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:31,200
brute force all the possible constraints
 

3075
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,390
brute force all the possible constraints
that could apply

3076
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
that could apply
 

3077
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,910
that could apply
well we'll see see more of that next

3078
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:33,920
well we'll see see more of that next
 

3079
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,839
well we'll see see more of that next
time that's it for today
