00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
I actually found this set of problem

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,589
I actually found this set of problem
session problems to be easier than the

instead of the usual four uh we'll see

54
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
instead of the usual four uh we'll see
 

55
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,789
instead of the usual four uh we'll see
how far we get see that I usually talk

56
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:13,799
how far we get see that I usually talk
 

57
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,070
how far we get see that I usually talk
too much anyway uh but I'll try to stay

58
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
too much anyway uh but I'll try to stay
 

59
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,270
too much anyway uh but I'll try to stay
on schedule here and we'll see how well

60
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
on schedule here and we'll see how well
 

61
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,030
on schedule here and we'll see how well
we do um any questions from our students

62
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
we do um any questions from our students
 

63
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,630
we do um any questions from our students
about dynamic programming before we get

64
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
about dynamic programming before we get
 

65
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,469
about dynamic programming before we get
started here cut one if you want we can

66
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:25,479
started here cut one if you want we can
 

67
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,109
started here cut one if you want we can
cut one oh I I will gladly cut one if I

68
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:28,119
cut one oh I I will gladly cut one if I
 

69
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,749
cut one oh I I will gladly cut one if I
run out of time yeah

70
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:30,759

okay so without further Ado uh let's get

72
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
okay so without further Ado uh let's get
 

73
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,310
okay so without further Ado uh let's get
started with uh coin crafting which is

coins I've been very self-conscious

92
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:09,640
coins I've been very self-conscious
 

93
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,150
coins I've been very self-conscious
about the way that I write the letter I

ever since Eric pointed it out and it's
 

97
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,710
ever since Eric pointed it out and it's
only gotten worse now it's inconsistent

98
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
only gotten worse now it's inconsistent
 

99
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,229
only gotten worse now it's inconsistent
and and hard to read uh but in any event

100
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
and and hard to read uh but in any event
 

101
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,430
and and hard to read uh but in any event
uh so we have uh n uh identical coins

102
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
uh so we have uh n uh identical coins
 

103
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,790
uh so we have uh n uh identical coins
and of course you know these coins have

104
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:23,800
and of course you know these coins have
 

105
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,430
and of course you know these coins have
very distinctive markings and so we

106
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
very distinctive markings and so we
 

107
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,150
very distinctive markings and so we
can't possibly run away with them as is

108
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
can't possibly run away with them as is
 

109
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,350
can't possibly run away with them as is
because if you take them to your

110
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
because if you take them to your
 

111
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,309
because if you take them to your
standard Jeweler they'll immediately

112
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:31,319
standard Jeweler they'll immediately
 

113
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,270
standard Jeweler they'll immediately
recognize that these markings are bad

114
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
recognize that these markings are bad
 

115
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,390
recognize that these markings are bad
and stolen and and that's not so good so

116
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,400
and stolen and and that's not so good so
 

117
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,910
and stolen and and that's not so good so
instead we can melt uh these coins into

118
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:38,920
instead we can melt uh these coins into
 

119
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,830
instead we can melt uh these coins into
other

120
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840

121
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,710

Thief here has identified a potential
buyer and uh the buyer has a few

126
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
buyer and uh the buyer has a few
 

127
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,630
buyer and uh the buyer has a few
criteria here right so we have a

128
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,640

 

129
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,070

buyer um and the buyer has the buyer has

130
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
buyer um and the buyer has the buyer has
 

131
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,830
buyer um and the buyer has the buyer has
a very strange value system thing that

132
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
a very strange value system thing that
 

133
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,509
a very strange value system thing that
apparently it's easy to take coins and

134
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:02,519
apparently it's easy to take coins and
 

135
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,869
apparently it's easy to take coins and
make them into other things uh but but

136
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
make them into other things uh but but
 

137
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,589
make them into other things uh but but
in any event the the the buyer what they

138
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:06,599
in any event the the the buyer what they
 

139
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,190
in any event the the the buyer what they
care about is not the fact that the

140
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,200
care about is not the fact that the
 

141
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,869
care about is not the fact that the
coins are made of gold but rather that

142
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
coins are made of gold but rather that
 

143
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,309
coins are made of gold but rather that
they like particular objects better than

144
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:13,319
they like particular objects better than
 

145
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,430
they like particular objects better than
others made out of said gold um so in

146
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,440
others made out of said gold um so in
 

147
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,830
others made out of said gold um so in
particular they have a different rate uh

148
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:18,840
particular they have a different rate uh
 

149
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,430
particular they have a different rate uh
for each object like a different price

150
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:20,440
for each object like a different price
 

151
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,149
for each object like a different price
they're willing to pay um and so they

152
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:23,159
they're willing to pay um and so they
 

153
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,630
they're willing to pay um and so they
have a list of

154
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:27,640

 

155
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,429

um uh uh

156
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:30,439
um uh uh
 

157
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,429
um uh uh
n objects that they're interested in uh

158
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:33,439
n objects that they're interested in uh
 

159
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,110
n objects that they're interested in uh
and each one uh is associated with two

160
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
and each one uh is associated with two
 

161
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,990
and each one uh is associated with two
things and objects uh they have a price

162
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
things and objects uh they have a price
 

163
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,350
things and objects uh they have a price
so the amount that the buyer is willing

164
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
so the amount that the buyer is willing
 

165
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,589
so the amount that the buyer is willing
to pay for that object which again is

166
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
to pay for that object which again is
 

167
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,270
to pay for that object which again is
not just the weight and gold for some

168
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
not just the weight and gold for some
 

169
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,429
not just the weight and gold for some
reason you know there's a value added

170
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:49,439
reason you know there's a value added
 

171
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,110
reason you know there's a value added
tax uh in in in in this universe uh and

172
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,120
tax uh in in in in this universe uh and
 

173
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,789
tax uh in in in in this universe uh and
uh it takes a different number of coins

174
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:55,799
uh it takes a different number of coins
 

175
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,030
uh it takes a different number of coins
to

176
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,040
to
 

177
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,990
to
manufacture right like so maybe maybe

178
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
manufacture right like so maybe maybe
 

179
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,190
manufacture right like so maybe maybe
you know I can make like a golden

180
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
you know I can make like a golden
 

181
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,550
you know I can make like a golden
chocolate fountain and that takes like

182
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
chocolate fountain and that takes like
 

183
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,429
chocolate fountain and that takes like
10 coins but I don't want two of those

184
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:06,439
10 coins but I don't want two of those
 

185
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,990
10 coins but I don't want two of those
so if I make that then the next thing I

186
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
so if I make that then the next thing I
 

187
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,229
so if I make that then the next thing I
have to do is like a figurine of of Eric

188
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
have to do is like a figurine of of Eric
 

189
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,190
have to do is like a figurine of of Eric
and Jason to to put alongside it um and

190
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
and Jason to to put alongside it um and
 

191
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,670
and Jason to to put alongside it um and
having more than one of those would also

192
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:14,680
having more than one of those would also
 

193
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,629
having more than one of those would also
be like creepy and weird right so so I

194
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
be like creepy and weird right so so I
 

195
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,189
be like creepy and weird right so so I
can only make one of each object uh and

196
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
can only make one of each object uh and
 

197
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,030
can only make one of each object uh and
of course uh my goal here is I have end

198
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,040
of course uh my goal here is I have end
 

199
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,670
of course uh my goal here is I have end
coins by the way the fact that there's

200
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
coins by the way the fact that there's
 

201
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,070
coins by the way the fact that there's
end coins and end objects for the buyer

202
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
end coins and end objects for the buyer
 

203
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,629
end coins and end objects for the buyer
doesn't really matter I mean it will for

204
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
doesn't really matter I mean it will for
 

205
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,230
doesn't really matter I mean it will for
the runtime but like you could imagine

206
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
the runtime but like you could imagine
 

207
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,790
the runtime but like you could imagine
this being n and M so I wouldn't be too

208
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
this being n and M so I wouldn't be too
 

209
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,790
this being n and M so I wouldn't be too
hung up on that um and what you're

210
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:35,800
hung up on that um and what you're
 

211
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,590
hung up on that um and what you're
trying to do is is of course maximize

212
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
trying to do is is of course maximize
 

213
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,950
trying to do is is of course maximize
your Revenue uh subject to the

214
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:39,960
your Revenue uh subject to the
 

215
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,550
your Revenue uh subject to the
constraints that uh you have end coins

216
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:43,560
constraints that uh you have end coins
 

217
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,909
constraints that uh you have end coins
uh and you can't make two objects that

218
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:44,919
uh and you can't make two objects that
 

219
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,950
uh and you can't make two objects that
are the same hopefully I've captured the

220
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:47,960
are the same hopefully I've captured the
 

221
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,430
are the same hopefully I've captured the
essence of our problem okay okay

222
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,440
essence of our problem okay okay
 

223
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,950
essence of our problem okay okay
fabulous so uh as with uh all of our our

224
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:53,960
fabulous so uh as with uh all of our our
 

225
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,310
fabulous so uh as with uh all of our our
our dynamic programming problems in

226
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
our dynamic programming problems in
 

227
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,629
our dynamic programming problems in
6006 uh we have a paradigm for how how

228
00:04:59,629 --> 00:04:59,639
6006 uh we have a paradigm for how how
 

229
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,670
6006 uh we have a paradigm for how how
to approach them um which has a cute

230
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
to approach them um which has a cute
 

231
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,590
to approach them um which has a cute
acronym which is sort bot uh and I think

232
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:04,600
acronym which is sort bot uh and I think
 

233
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,790
acronym which is sort bot uh and I think
sbot is a totally relevant and

234
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
sbot is a totally relevant and
 

235
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,110
sbot is a totally relevant and
straightforward approach to uh this

236
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
straightforward approach to uh this
 

237
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,710
straightforward approach to uh this
problem here yeah so uh in particular

238
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:11,720
problem here yeah so uh in particular
 

239
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,550
problem here yeah so uh in particular
let's let's give ourselves a bit of of

240
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:13,560
let's let's give ourselves a bit of of
 

241
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,629
let's let's give ourselves a bit of of
notation right so we're going to number

242
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:15,639
notation right so we're going to number
 

243
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,029
notation right so we're going to number
our objects between one and N uh just

244
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:18,039
our objects between one and N uh just
 

245
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,870
our objects between one and N uh just
for convenience so we'll say that uh p i

246
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
for convenience so we'll say that uh p i
 

247
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,710
for convenience so we'll say that uh p i
is the

248
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
is the
 

249
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,469
is the
price of uh object

250
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
price of uh object
 

251
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,430
price of uh object
I

252
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:30,440
I
 

253
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,870
I
okay and uh we'll say that Ki is the

254
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:35,880
okay and uh we'll say that Ki is the
 

255
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,909
okay and uh we'll say that Ki is the
what the problem calls the

00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
what the problem calls the
 

257
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,670
what the problem calls the
melting uh number in other words if I

258
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:40,680
melting uh number in other words if I
 

259
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,430
melting uh number in other words if I
want to make object I this is the amount

260
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:42,440
want to make object I this is the amount
 

261
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,510
want to make object I this is the amount
of coins that I'd have to me uh melt to

262
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:44,520
of coins that I'd have to me uh melt to
 

263
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,749
of coins that I'd have to me uh melt to
to make that object okay so just a tiny

264
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:46,759
to make that object okay so just a tiny
 

265
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,230
to make that object okay so just a tiny
bit of

bit of
 

267
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,550
bit of
notation and in general so okay what do

that are smaller uh and when we compose
 

277
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,710
that are smaller uh and when we compose
them all together uh we get the the

302
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
particular uh the two sort of variables
 

303
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,990
particular uh the two sort of variables
here uh you know when I make new object

304
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
here uh you know when I make new object
 

305
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,870
here uh you know when I make new object
is what object did I make and how many

306
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
is what object did I make and how many
 

307
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,270
is what object did I make and how many
coins did I spend when I did that so

308
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
coins did I spend when I did that so
 

309
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,830
coins did I spend when I did that so
sort of the two natural parameters to

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:44,680
recursive in the sense that um I can
 

319
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,430
recursive in the sense that um I can
either choose to make object I or not

320

either choose to make object I or not
 

321
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,230
either choose to make object I or not
and it doesn't matter what order I make

definition of the thing that we're going
 

407
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,269
definition of the thing that we're going
to chase after

408
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:36,279
to chase after
 

409
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:44,710
to chase after
here

410
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720

 

411
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,310

fabulous okay right so uh let's do uh

412
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
fabulous okay right so uh let's do uh
 

413
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,590
fabulous okay right so uh let's do uh
let's continue sort bot so our next uh

414
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:52,600
let's continue sort bot so our next uh
 

415
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,670
let's continue sort bot so our next uh
uh uh piece of our puzzle here is the r

416
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
uh uh piece of our puzzle here is the r
 

417
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,550
uh uh piece of our puzzle here is the r
I believe R stands for recursion this is

418
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,560
I believe R stands for recursion this is
 

419
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,389
I believe R stands for recursion this is
a new acronym for me too oh nope no

420
00:08:59,389 --> 00:08:59,399
a new acronym for me too oh nope no
 

421
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,750
a new acronym for me too oh nope no
relate but it might as well be recursion

422
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
relate but it might as well be recursion
 

423
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,790
relate but it might as well be recursion
for for most of these problems uh right

424
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
for for most of these problems uh right
 

425
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,949
for for most of these problems uh right
so the basic relationship here is that

426
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
so the basic relationship here is that
 

427
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,310
so the basic relationship here is that
of course I can either use object J or I

428
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
of course I can either use object J or I
 

429
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,190
of course I can either use object J or I
can not use object J uh and and in both

430
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,200
can not use object J uh and and in both
 

431
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,630
can not use object J uh and and in both
of those cases right if J is the very

432
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
of those cases right if J is the very
 

433
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,870
of those cases right if J is the very
last guy that I'm going to consider uh

434
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
last guy that I'm going to consider uh
 

435
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,509
last guy that I'm going to consider uh
that'll be a totally reasonable

436
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:20,519
that'll be a totally reasonable
 

437
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,790
that'll be a totally reasonable
recursive rule right so in

438
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
recursive rule right so in
 

439
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,910
recursive rule right so in
particular um I have that uh XI

440
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
particular um I have that uh XI
 

441
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,710
particular um I have that uh XI
J um essentially can take one of two

442
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
J um essentially can take one of two
 

443
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,350
J um essentially can take one of two
values a parenthesis in case you're

444
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
values a parenthesis in case you're
 

445
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,590
values a parenthesis in case you're
wondering um and and of course you're

446
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
wondering um and and of course you're
 

447
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,310
wondering um and and of course you're
trying to maximize your

448
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,320
trying to maximize your
 

449
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:44,949
trying to maximize your
Revenue uh so so let's do that okay so

450
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959

 

451
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,750

um so we have sort of two OB uh

452
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
um so we have sort of two OB uh
 

453
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,590
um so we have sort of two OB uh
potentially potential options but we

454
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
potentially potential options but we
 

455
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,790
potentially potential options but we
have to be a bit careful is there a case

456
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:51,800
have to be a bit careful is there a case
 

457
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,430
have to be a bit careful is there a case
where I can't make object

458
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440

 

459
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,190

J yes class there is uh which is uh the

460
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
J yes class there is uh which is uh the
 

461
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,630
J yes class there is uh which is uh the
case where I don't have enough coins

462
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
case where I don't have enough coins
 

463
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,430
case where I don't have enough coins
left in the bank right so I want to make

464
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,440
left in the bank right so I want to make
 

465
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,910
left in the bank right so I want to make
that really expensive Fountain but I

466
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
that really expensive Fountain but I
 

467
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,550
that really expensive Fountain but I
only have one coin then I'm I'm sort of

468
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:05,560
only have one coin then I'm I'm sort of
 

469
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,829
only have one coin then I'm I'm sort of
out of luck yep so uh let's do these two

470
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:08,839
out of luck yep so uh let's do these two
 

471
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,389
out of luck yep so uh let's do these two
cases so

472
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
cases so
 

473
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,470
cases so
first um you know if

474
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:17,480

 

475
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,230

uh oops I got my cases

476
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
uh oops I got my cases
 

477
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,870
uh oops I got my cases
backward that's okay um right so let's

478
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
backward that's okay um right so let's
 

479
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,509
backward that's okay um right so let's
say that I choose not to uh make uh

480
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
say that I choose not to uh make uh
 

481
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,110
say that I choose not to uh make uh
object J okay so what does that mean so

482
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,120
object J okay so what does that mean so
 

483
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,949
object J okay so what does that mean so
so did I spend any coins

484
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:29,959
so did I spend any coins
 

485
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,990
so did I spend any coins
no and moreover what is my maximum

486
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,000
no and moreover what is my maximum
 

487
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,389
no and moreover what is my maximum
profit well it's going to be the same as

488
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
profit well it's going to be the same as
 

489
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,550
profit well it's going to be the same as
the maximum profit using objects 1

490
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
the maximum profit using objects 1
 

491
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,790
the maximum profit using objects 1
through J minus one because I didn't use

492
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
through J minus one because I didn't use
 

493
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,030
through J minus one because I didn't use
object J yeah so in particular that

494
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
object J yeah so in particular that
 

495
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,949
object J yeah so in particular that
would be

496
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
would be
 

497
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,829
would be
X um let's see I got it backward in my

498
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:46,839
X um let's see I got it backward in my
 

499
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,190
X um let's see I got it backward in my
notes so we're going to do it live uh

500
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
notes so we're going to do it live uh
 

501
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,389
notes so we're going to do it live uh
like that okay and otherwise let's say

502
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:53,399
like that okay and otherwise let's say
 

503
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,150
like that okay and otherwise let's say
that I did choose to make object J well

504
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
that I did choose to make object J well
 

505
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,030
that I did choose to make object J well
what happens so I did get some Revenue

506
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,040
what happens so I did get some Revenue
 

507
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,069
what happens so I did get some Revenue
now right so I got man what on Earth did

508
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:01,079
now right so I got man what on Earth did
 

509
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,910
now right so I got man what on Earth did
I write on these uh not um so I get the

510
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:04,920
I write on these uh not um so I get the
 

511
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,910
I write on these uh not um so I get the
uh price of object J here as my Revenue

512
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
uh price of object J here as my Revenue
 

513
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,509
uh price of object J here as my Revenue
but I spent uh some coins in the

514
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
but I spent uh some coins in the
 

515
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,670
but I spent uh some coins in the
process so I have I minus uh K sub I

516
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:16,680
process so I have I minus uh K sub I
 

517
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,990
process so I have I minus uh K sub I
which is the number of

518
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
which is the number of
 

519
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,150
which is the number of
coins what was that oh thank you sorry K

520
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
coins what was that oh thank you sorry K
 

521
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,110

subj that's why we should be consistent

522
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,120
subj that's why we should be consistent
 

523
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,310

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:25,320
with our indices when we write these
 

525
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,269
with our indices when we write these
things down um right so I spent K sub J

526
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
things down um right so I spent K sub J
 

527
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,310
things down um right so I spent K sub J
coins uh making this thing uh object J

529
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,470

uh and uh moreover I can still choose to

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
uh and uh moreover I can still choose to
 

531
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,949
uh and uh moreover I can still choose to
make any of the previous object so it's

532
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:37,959
make any of the previous object so it's
 

533
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,629
make any of the previous object so it's
still just J minus

534
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:39,639
still just J minus
 

535
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,949
still just J minus
one but I have to be careful because I

536
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:41,959
one but I have to be careful because I
 

537
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,110
one but I have to be careful because I
can't always do this in

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
can't always do this in
 

539
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,470

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
particular uh what we need in some sense
 

553
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,310
particular uh what we need in some sense
is I minus K minus J KJ to be greater or

554
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
is I minus K minus J KJ to be greater or
 

555
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,470
is I minus K minus J KJ to be greater or
equal to zero or equivalently I is

equal to zero or equivalently I is
 

557
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,470
equal to zero or equivalently I is
greater than or equal to K so J I think

558
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:09,480
greater than or equal to K so J I think
 

559
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,710
greater than or equal to K so J I think
you guys could all do that one at home

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,240
okay and this is our recursion uh

okay and this is our recursion uh
hopefully I've gotten it right because

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:14,360
hopefully I've gotten it right because

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
but uh I think it's pretty

straightforward essentially either I can

uh of course decrements uh J cuz that's

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:29,320
uh of course decrements uh J cuz that's
 

579
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,550
uh of course decrements uh J cuz that's
the index of the object I'm considering

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:31,560
the index of the object I'm considering
 

581
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,310
the index of the object I'm considering
uh and I either account for the price

582
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,320
uh and I either account for the price
 

583
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,550
uh and I either account for the price
but have to pay in gold or I don't

584
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:35,560
but have to pay in gold or I don't
 

585
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,870
but have to pay in gold or I don't
account for the price so implicitly

through every one of these steps because
 

597
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,509
through every one of these steps because
a lot of the arguments are kind of

598
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
a lot of the arguments are kind of
 

599
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,509
a lot of the arguments are kind of
similar but for now we'll do one or two

600
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
similar but for now we'll do one or two

605
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,509

J minus
 

617
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,230
J minus
one right so of course on your problem

618
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,240
one right so of course on your problem
 

619
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,310
one right so of course on your problem
set you should write things more

620
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
set you should write things more
 

621
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,509
set you should write things more
carefully uh but the basic Point here is

622
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:20,519
carefully uh but the basic Point here is
 

623
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,870
carefully uh but the basic Point here is
that there's a clear topological order

624
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
that there's a clear topological order
 

625
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,389
that there's a clear topological order
just by looking at that second index

626
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
just by looking at that second index
 

627
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,389
just by looking at that second index
because you kind of if you think of all

628
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:25,399
because you kind of if you think of all
 

629
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,310
because you kind of if you think of all
of your X's as variables in a graph

630
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:27,320
of your X's as variables in a graph
 

631
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,710
of your X's as variables in a graph
which we've actually drawn in lecture so

632
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:29,720
which we've actually drawn in lecture so
 

633
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,590
which we've actually drawn in lecture so
like maybe these are all the I's and

634
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:32,600
like maybe these are all the I's and
 

635
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,590
like maybe these are all the I's and
then you know the J you know so like I

636
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:34,600
then you know the J you know so like I
 

637
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,110
then you know the J you know so like I
goes down and J goes to the right then

638
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,120
goes down and J goes to the right then
 

639
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,790
goes down and J goes to the right then
essentially this argument is saying that

640
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:39,800
essentially this argument is saying that
 

641
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,710
essentially this argument is saying that
all the arrows kind of Point left in

642
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
all the arrows kind of Point left in
 

643
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,550
all the arrows kind of Point left in
this

um suppose the way I've drawn my arrows

648
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:47,959

um suppose the way I've drawn my arrows
this isn't quite accurate but it

650
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
this isn't quite accurate but it
 

651
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,150
this isn't quite accurate but it
actually doesn't matter the only thing

652
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
actually doesn't matter the only thing
 

653
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,509
actually doesn't matter the only thing
that matters is that it goes from right

654
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
that matters is that it goes from right
 

655
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,590
that matters is that it goes from right
to left um but I'm going to erase this

656
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:54,600
to left um but I'm going to erase this
 

657
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,749
to left um but I'm going to erase this
so you don't remember it

658
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:57,759
so you don't remember it
 

659
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,269
so you don't remember it
okay so in general just when you when

660
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:00,279
okay so in general just when you when
 

661
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,749
okay so in general just when you when
you want to make your topological order

662
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:01,759
you want to make your topological order
 

663
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,749
you want to make your topological order
argument I think a totally sensible one

664
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:03,759
argument I think a totally sensible one
 

665
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,350
argument I think a totally sensible one
is like looking at the indices of your

666
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
is like looking at the indices of your
 

667
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,150
is like looking at the indices of your
recursion and then just trying to find

668
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,160
recursion and then just trying to find
 

669
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,749
recursion and then just trying to find
some number that

670
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:08,759
some number that
 

671
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,670
some number that
decreases incidentally if you take a

672
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:10,680
decreases incidentally if you take a
 

673
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,670
decreases incidentally if you take a
differential equation course uh that's

674
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:12,680
differential equation course uh that's
 

675
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,990
differential equation course uh that's
roughly how you prove that a lot of

676
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
roughly how you prove that a lot of
 

677
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,310
roughly how you prove that a lot of
those things converge too um so there's

678
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
those things converge too um so there's
 

679
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,230
those things converge too um so there's
a a sort of a generic math trick that we

680
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
a a sort of a generic math trick that we
 

681
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,350
a a sort of a generic math trick that we
use a lot you call that in in in od

682
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
use a lot you call that in in in od
 

683
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,269
use a lot you call that in in in od
where you have some number that

684
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
where you have some number that
 

685
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,150
where you have some number that
decreases I would call potential

686
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,160
decreases I would call potential
 

687
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,430
decreases I would call potential
function potential function that's a

688
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:26,440
function potential function that's a
 

689
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,430
function potential function that's a
perfectly sensible one there's the it's

690
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:28,440
perfectly sensible one there's the it's
 

691
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,910
perfectly sensible one there's the it's
not lip shits it's some other

692
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
not lip shits it's some other
 

693
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,629
not lip shits it's some other
mathematician anyway uh okay so let's

694
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:33,639
mathematician anyway uh okay so let's
 

695
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,829
mathematician anyway uh okay so let's
continue uh sord bot so next we need B

696
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
continue uh sord bot so next we need B
 

697
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,749
continue uh sord bot so next we need B
which is our base

698
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:37,759
which is our base
 

699
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,350
which is our base
case uh so in this case uh is pretty

700
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:40,360
case uh so in this case uh is pretty
 

701
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,790
case uh so in this case uh is pretty
straightforward if I if I don't have any

702
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:41,800
straightforward if I if I don't have any
 

703
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,069
straightforward if I if I don't have any
coins I can't make any

704
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
coins I can't make any
 

705
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,350
coins I can't make any
money I have a t-shirt that that says

706
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,360
money I have a t-shirt that that says
 

707
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,150
money I have a t-shirt that that says
that at home uh and moreover uh if I

708
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,160
that at home uh and moreover uh if I
 

709
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,470
that at home uh and moreover uh if I
can't sell anything I can't make any

710
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
can't sell anything I can't make any
 

711
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,350
can't sell anything I can't make any
money uh so those are are pretty

712
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,360
money uh so those are are pretty
 

713
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,069
money uh so those are are pretty
straight forward cases so we have that

714
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
straight forward cases so we have that
 

715
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,790
straight forward cases so we have that
zero

716
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:55,800
zero
 

717
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,189
zero
equals x of 0 comma J remember the first

718
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:00,199
equals x of 0 comma J remember the first
 

719
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,990
equals x of 0 comma J remember the first
index is the number of coins you have so

720
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,000
index is the number of coins you have so
 

721
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,470
index is the number of coins you have so
this is saying I don't I can't make

722
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:05,480
this is saying I don't I can't make
 

723
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,430
this is saying I don't I can't make
anything if I don't have any coins and

724
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
anything if I don't have any coins and
 

725
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,150
anything if I don't have any coins and
similarly equals x i comma 0 for all i j

726
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
similarly equals x i comma 0 for all i j
 

727
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,829
similarly equals x i comma 0 for all i j
right so this is the coins and the uh

728
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
right so this is the coins and the uh
 

729
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,470
right so this is the coins and the uh
objects okay so let's see I keep writing

730
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:21,480
objects okay so let's see I keep writing
 

731
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,949
objects okay so let's see I keep writing
these problem sessions too big and then

732
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
these problem sessions too big and then
 

733
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,509
these problem sessions too big and then
spending half of it erasing so let's

734
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:24,519
spending half of it erasing so let's
 

735
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,230
spending half of it erasing so let's
let's try and fit this on one board here

736
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
let's try and fit this on one board here
 

737
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,069
let's try and fit this on one board here
so we're going to do sort but then the

738
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
so we're going to do sort but then the
 

739
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,550
so we're going to do sort but then the
second no the first o because there's no

740
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
second no the first o because there's no
 

741
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,269
second no the first o because there's no
o in sort um is the uh the uh what the

742
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:36,279
o in sort um is the uh the uh what the
 

743
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,990
o in sort um is the uh the uh what the
original problem that you want to solve

744
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
original problem that you want to solve
 

745
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,590
original problem that you want to solve
so of course you start out with n

746
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:40,600
so of course you start out with n
 

747
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,230
so of course you start out with n
objects and N

748
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
objects and N
 

749
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,590
objects and N
coins uh

750
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:44,600
coins uh
 

751
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,150
coins uh
so the original problem we want to solve

752
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,160
so the original problem we want to solve
 

753
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,110
so the original problem we want to solve
uh is equivalent to Computing xn comma n

754
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,120
uh is equivalent to Computing xn comma n
 

755
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,150
uh is equivalent to Computing xn comma n
and then finally we got to do our

756
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
and then finally we got to do our
 

757
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,990
and then finally we got to do our
runtime T stands for runtime or time I

758
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
runtime T stands for runtime or time I
 

759
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,829
runtime T stands for runtime or time I
suppose um so first of all how many many

760
00:15:58,829 --> 00:15:58,839
suppose um so first of all how many many
 

761
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,030
suppose um so first of all how many many
sub problems are there well there's x i

762
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
sub problems are there well there's x i
 

763
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,309
sub problems are there well there's x i
j both I can go from 0er to n this is a

764
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:05,319
j both I can go from 0er to n this is a
 

765
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,870
j both I can go from 0er to n this is a
great way to be off by one um so there's

766
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:07,880
great way to be off by one um so there's
 

767
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,629
great way to be off by one um so there's
n + 1 squared

768
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
n + 1 squared
 

769
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,350
n + 1 squared
sub

770
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,360
sub
 

771
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,749
sub
problems uh and how much work does each

772
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:16,759
problems uh and how much work does each
 

773
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,269
problems uh and how much work does each
sub problem do well it does boring work

774
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
sub problem do well it does boring work
 

775
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,710
sub problem do well it does boring work
it's just a formula right so there's

776
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:21,720
it's just a formula right so there's
 

777
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,509
it's just a formula right so there's
order one

778
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:24,519
order one
 

779
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,870
order one
work per sub problem so the overall

780
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:29,880
work per sub problem so the overall
 

781
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,710
work per sub problem so the overall
algorithm takes n^2

782
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
algorithm takes n^2
 

783
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,110
algorithm takes n^2
time so I promised to do something last

784
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,120
time so I promised to do something last
 

785
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,230
time so I promised to do something last
in our last problem session then I

786
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:37,240
in our last problem session then I
 

787
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,030
in our last problem session then I
didn't actually do it uh so I did think

788
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
didn't actually do it uh so I did think
 

789
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,629
didn't actually do it uh so I did think
I would spend just a minute uh here sort

790
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:41,639
I would spend just a minute uh here sort
 

791
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,949
I would spend just a minute uh here sort
of translating what this sbot thing

792
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:43,959
of translating what this sbot thing
 

793
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,230
of translating what this sbot thing
would mean in terms of of code because I

794
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
would mean in terms of of code because I
 

795
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,590
would mean in terms of of code because I
think that it's a little bit implicit

796
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
think that it's a little bit implicit
 

797
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,829
think that it's a little bit implicit
here in particular I think this step

798
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
here in particular I think this step
 

799
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,189
here in particular I think this step
here I mean you will'll see that it

800
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:52,199
here I mean you will'll see that it
 

801
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,069
here I mean you will'll see that it
really clearly is going to give you an

802
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
really clearly is going to give you an
 

803
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,590
really clearly is going to give you an
algorithm but I think it's kind of easy

804
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
algorithm but I think it's kind of easy
 

805
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,670
algorithm but I think it's kind of easy
to like again just to to forget what

806
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:58,680
to like again just to to forget what
 

807
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,910
to like again just to to forget what
what your code actually looks like and

808
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
what your code actually looks like and
 

809
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,430
what your code actually looks like and
actually the coding problems on these

810
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
actually the coding problems on these
 

811
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,829
actually the coding problems on these
problem sessions are almost too

812
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
problem sessions are almost too
 

813
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,909
problem sessions are almost too
interesting and and and can obscure it a

814
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:04,919
interesting and and and can obscure it a
 

815
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,590
interesting and and and can obscure it a
little bit so I thought we'd do a boring

816
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:06,600
little bit so I thought we'd do a boring
 

817
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,590
little bit so I thought we'd do a boring
problem and show you uh that it's really

818
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:08,600
problem and show you uh that it's really
 

819
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,270
problem and show you uh that it's really
not so hard to to do this and in fact uh

820
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
not so hard to to do this and in fact uh
 

821
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,150
not so hard to to do this and in fact uh
we covered two different strategies in

822
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,160
we covered two different strategies in
 

823
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,390
we covered two different strategies in
class for how to take sort bot and

824
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:15,400
class for how to take sort bot and
 

825
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,189
class for how to take sort bot and
convert it into a piece of code although

826
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
convert it into a piece of code although
 

827
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,029
convert it into a piece of code although
they might have uh kind of zipped past

828
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
they might have uh kind of zipped past
 

829
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,630
they might have uh kind of zipped past
you in in this you know 2x speed uh

830
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:21,640
you in in this you know 2x speed uh
 

831
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,710
you in in this you know 2x speed uh
thing that you can do now um so right so

832
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
thing that you can do now um so right so
 

833
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,630
thing that you can do now um so right so
here are two options um one of them is

834
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
here are two options um one of them is
 

835
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,950
here are two options um one of them is
called memorization uh and the other I

836
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
called memorization uh and the other I
 

837
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,630
called memorization uh and the other I
don't know bottom up I guess is a

838
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
don't know bottom up I guess is a
 

839
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,870
don't know bottom up I guess is a
reasonable phrase uh to describe and so

840
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
reasonable phrase uh to describe and so
 

841
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,710
reasonable phrase uh to describe and so
I thought we'd do them both because

842
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:33,720
I thought we'd do them both because
 

843
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,029
I thought we'd do them both because
they're both easy for this particular

844
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:36,039
they're both easy for this particular
 

845
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,710
they're both easy for this particular
problem

846
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
problem
 

847
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,430
problem
um

848
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,440
um
 

849
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,549
um
okay right so um let's do that so let's

850
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
okay right so um let's do that so let's
 

851
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,909
okay right so um let's do that so let's
uh so is this necessary on your homework

852
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
uh so is this necessary on your homework
 

853
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,590
uh so is this necessary on your homework
strictly speaking no like if you've

854
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
strictly speaking no like if you've
 

855
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,909
strictly speaking no like if you've
you've gone through sort bot then

856
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
you've gone through sort bot then
 

857
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,070
you've gone through sort bot then
essentially everything that happens

858
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,080
essentially everything that happens
 

859
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,870
essentially everything that happens
after that is sort of boilerplate in

860
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
after that is sort of boilerplate in
 

861
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,510
after that is sort of boilerplate in
terms of converting these steps into a

862
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
terms of converting these steps into a
 

863
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,190
terms of converting these steps into a
piece of code or an out algorithm but I

864
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
piece of code or an out algorithm but I
 

865
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,029
piece of code or an out algorithm but I
do think just for understanding why sort

866
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
do think just for understanding why sort
 

867
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,630
do think just for understanding why sort
bot makes sense uh it's worth thinking

868
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
bot makes sense uh it's worth thinking
 

869
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,990
bot makes sense uh it's worth thinking
about for a minute um so option A here

870
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
about for a minute um so option A here
 

871
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,350
about for a minute um so option A here
is

872
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:10,360

 

873
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,430

memoization ironically I've taught and

874
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:12,440
memoization ironically I've taught and
 

875
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,270
memoization ironically I've taught and
ta algorithms a few times and I never

876
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,280
ta algorithms a few times and I never
 

877
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,710
ta algorithms a few times and I never
actually knew what memorization uh meant

878
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
actually knew what memorization uh meant
 

879
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,909
actually knew what memorization uh meant
so I I learned something from from

880
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
so I I learned something from from
 

881
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,310
so I I learned something from from
Eric's lecture the other day um which

882
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
Eric's lecture the other day um which
 

883
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,510
Eric's lecture the other day um which
remember memorization the key thing and

884
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
remember memorization the key thing and
 

885
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,149
remember memorization the key thing and
then what apparently is kind of a madeup

886
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:25,159
then what apparently is kind of a madeup
 

887
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,750
then what apparently is kind of a madeup
word is memo like you know if you're

888
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
word is memo like you know if you're
 

889
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,029
word is memo like you know if you're
back in the day you had a what a stopad

890
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:30,039
back in the day you had a what a stopad
 

891
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,909
back in the day you had a what a stopad
and you were writing down stuff because

892
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
and you were writing down stuff because
 

893
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,190
and you were writing down stuff because
that's where you solve problems with

894
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
that's where you solve problems with
 

895
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,870
that's where you solve problems with
your slide rule um then uh essentially

896
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
your slide rule um then uh essentially
 

897
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,830
your slide rule um then uh essentially
the idea is that if I compute xig for

898
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
the idea is that if I compute xig for
 

899
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,110
the idea is that if I compute xig for
some pair I shouldn't compute it again I

900
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
some pair I shouldn't compute it again I
 

901
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,870
some pair I shouldn't compute it again I
should just write it down on my memo pad

902
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:45,880
should just write it down on my memo pad
 

903
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,270
should just write it down on my memo pad
um steno isation sounds better to me but

904
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,280
um steno isation sounds better to me but
 

905
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,149
um steno isation sounds better to me but
I suppose we'd have to go back to the 19

906
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:50,159
I suppose we'd have to go back to the 19
 

907
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,470
I suppose we'd have to go back to the 19
what 40s and fix it um okay so let's uh

908
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
what 40s and fix it um okay so let's uh
 

909
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,070
what 40s and fix it um okay so let's uh
actually write down I'm going to write

910
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
actually write down I'm going to write
 

911
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,390
actually write down I'm going to write
down pseudo code that'll probably look

912
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:57,400
down pseudo code that'll probably look
 

913
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,070
down pseudo code that'll probably look
more like mat lab cuz I'm that kind of

914
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,080
more like mat lab cuz I'm that kind of
 

915
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,549
more like mat lab cuz I'm that kind of
guy uh so uh let's say that I wanted to

916
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,559
guy uh so uh let's say that I wanted to
 

917
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,270
guy uh so uh let's say that I wanted to
make a

918
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
make a
 

919
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,110
make a
function um which I guess is

920
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
function um which I guess is
 

921
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,430
function um which I guess is
revenue of i j uh like

922
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:12,440
revenue of i j uh like
 

923
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,190
revenue of i j uh like
that um and and and and this is the

924
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
that um and and and and this is the
 

925
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,470
that um and and and and this is the
thing I wanted to

926
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
thing I wanted to
 

927
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,350
thing I wanted to
compute oh that's actually going to be a

928
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,360
compute oh that's actually going to be a
 

929
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,750
compute oh that's actually going to be a
problem because we're not be able to

932
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,240
see okay right so in addition to
 

933
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,950
see okay right so in addition to
this I I'm going to kind of pass in an

934
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:27,960
this I I'm going to kind of pass in an
 

935
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,990
this I I'm going to kind of pass in an
array X um which is going to be like the

936
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,000
array X um which is going to be like the
 

937
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,669
array X um which is going to be like the
my my memo pad this is going to be

00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:32,679
my my memo pad this is going to be

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,990
my my memo pad this is going to be
terrible coding practice but easy board

940
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,000
terrible coding practice but easy board
 

941
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,870
terrible coding practice but easy board
coding uh practice so like if I were in

942
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
coding uh practice so like if I were in
 

943
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,909
coding uh practice so like if I were in
C++ maybe I pass it by reference so that

944
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:38,919
C++ maybe I pass it by reference so that
 

945
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,630

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,510
whatever
uh you know when I edit X it actually

950
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
uh you know when I edit X it actually
 

951
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,710
uh you know when I edit X it actually
persists when I when I recurse this is

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:47,720
persists when I when I recurse this is
 

953
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,950
persists when I when I recurse this is
terrible coding practice and you

954
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
terrible coding practice and you
 

955
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,510
terrible coding practice and you
shouldn't do it okay um but it's just

956
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
shouldn't do it okay um but it's just
 

957
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,549
shouldn't do it okay um but it's just
going to be because I don't want to

958
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
going to be because I don't want to
 

959
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,950
going to be because I don't want to
write too many lines on the board here

960
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
write too many lines on the board here
 

961
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,070
write too many lines on the board here
um and maybe we initialize like we have

962
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
um and maybe we initialize like we have
 

963
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,470
um and maybe we initialize like we have
some helper

964
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:01,480

 

965
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,549

function uh to Let's see we want our

966
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
function uh to Let's see we want our
 

967
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,190
function uh to Let's see we want our
Revenue to be big well actually no we'll

968
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,200
Revenue to be big well actually no we'll
 

969
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,789
Revenue to be big well actually no we'll
just initialize it to like not a number

970
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:09,799
just initialize it to like not a number
 

971
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,110
just initialize it to like not a number
so that like we know that we haven't

972
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
so that like we know that we haven't
 

973
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,950
so that like we know that we haven't
computed it yet how about

974
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
computed it yet how about
 

975
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,390
computed it yet how about
that okay so

976
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
that okay so
 

977
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,630
that okay so
uh what should we do well if we're going

978
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,640
uh what should we do well if we're going
 

979
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,350
uh what should we do well if we're going
to memoize the first thing we should do

980
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,360
to memoize the first thing we should do
 

981
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,190
to memoize the first thing we should do
anytime that I call my Revenue function

982
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,200
anytime that I call my Revenue function
 

983
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,029
anytime that I call my Revenue function
on on an AJ pair is check have already

984
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:24,039
on on an AJ pair is check have already
 

985
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,710
on on an AJ pair is check have already
computed it yeah um so in my kind of

986
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
computed it yeah um so in my kind of
 

987
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,470
computed it yeah um so in my kind of
goofy bad board coding style here what

988
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:29,480
goofy bad board coding style here what
 

989
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,750
goofy bad board coding style here what
could I do I'd say well if I've already

990
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:30,760
could I do I'd say well if I've already
 

991
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,549
could I do I'd say well if I've already
computed it then this thing won't equal

992
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
computed it then this thing won't equal
 

993
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,750
computed it then this thing won't equal
Nan anymore it won't be not a number so

994
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:34,760
Nan anymore it won't be not a number so
 

995
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,909
Nan anymore it won't be not a number so
I can say okay if x i j is not equal not

996
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:40,919
I can say okay if x i j is not equal not
 

997
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,190
I can say okay if x i j is not equal not
a number so in other words it is a

998
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
a number so in other words it is a
 

999
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,270
a number so in other words it is a
number um

1000
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,280

 

1001
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,070

return and this like I think that this

1002
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,080
return and this like I think that this
 

1003
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,750
return and this like I think that this
little line of code here it gets like a

1004
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:52,760
little line of code here it gets like a
 

1005
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,430
little line of code here it gets like a
little loss but this is like we should

1006
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:54,440
little loss but this is like we should
 

1007
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,990
little loss but this is like we should
put like sparkles around it right this

1008
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,000
put like sparkles around it right this
 

1009
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,669
put like sparkles around it right this
is the magic of dynamic programming

1010
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
is the magic of dynamic programming
 

1011
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,669
is the magic of dynamic programming
because I just killed recursive CS right

1012
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:02,679
because I just killed recursive CS right
 

1013
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,230
because I just killed recursive CS right
like I even if I and J are like 17 and

1014
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,240
like I even if I and J are like 17 and
 

1015
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,029
like I even if I and J are like 17 and
23 if I already computed it I'm done

1016
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:08,039
23 if I already computed it I'm done
 

1017
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,270
23 if I already computed it I'm done
right I I don't have to call my

1018
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
right I I don't have to call my
 

1019
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,110
right I I don't have to call my
recursion again okay and otherwise what

1020
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
recursion again okay and otherwise what
 

1021
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,269
recursion again okay and otherwise what
am I going to do

1022
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:16,279
am I going to do
 

1023
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,070
am I going to do
um well otherwise I'll you know maybe

1024
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
um well otherwise I'll you know maybe
 

1025
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,269
um well otherwise I'll you know maybe
call do I want to write it all down I

1026
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:22,279
call do I want to write it all down I
 

1027
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:25,950
call do I want to write it all down I
don't want to write that all down

1028
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:25,960
don't want to write that all down
 

1029
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,110
don't want to write that all down
um so otherwise

1030
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
um so otherwise
 

1031
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,029
um so otherwise
I'm going to

1032
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039

 

1033
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,549

evaluate R where R is this formula over

1034
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
evaluate R where R is this formula over
 

1035
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,750
evaluate R where R is this formula over
here notice that this will

1036
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:38,760
here notice that this will
 

1037
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,070
here notice that this will
require um recursive calls right uh and

1038
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
require um recursive calls right uh and
 

1039
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,110
require um recursive calls right uh and
I'm going to store it in

1040
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120

 

1041
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,950

x i

1042
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
x i
 

1043
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,230
x i
j and then return x i

1044
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240

 

1045
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,710

j okay so B basically the only

1046
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
j okay so B basically the only
 

1047
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,950
j okay so B basically the only
difference between like what we've seen

1048
00:21:59,950 --> 00:21:59,960
difference between like what we've seen
 

1049
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,750
difference between like what we've seen
in the first two3 of 66 and now is this

1050
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
in the first two3 of 66 and now is this
 

1051
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,549
in the first two3 of 66 and now is this
beautiful line of code saying if I

1052
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:05,559
beautiful line of code saying if I
 

1053
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,830
beautiful line of code saying if I
already computed this thing return it

1054
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
already computed this thing return it
 

1055
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,070
already computed this thing return it
and this is the memorized version of our

1056
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
and this is the memorized version of our
 

1057
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,190
and this is the memorized version of our
algorithm um I think this is sort of the

1058
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,200
algorithm um I think this is sort of the
 

1059
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,510
algorithm um I think this is sort of the
easiest one to maybe think about but

1060
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
easiest one to maybe think about but
 

1061
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,070
easiest one to maybe think about but
actually from a runtime analysis it's a

1062
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,080
actually from a runtime analysis it's a
 

1063
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,950
actually from a runtime analysis it's a
little bit annoying um it's not in the

1064
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:19,960
little bit annoying um it's not in the
 

1065
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,669
little bit annoying um it's not in the
sense that we convince ourselves that SB

1066
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
sense that we convince ourselves that SB
 

1067
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,310
sense that we convince ourselves that SB
is okay but of course like if you're

1068
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,320
is okay but of course like if you're
 

1069
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,909
is okay but of course like if you're
thinking about your recursion tree like

1070
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:24,919
thinking about your recursion tree like
 

1071
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:26,630
thinking about your recursion tree like
what's happening is that you're sort of

1072
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
what's happening is that you're sort of
 

1073
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,310
what's happening is that you're sort of
maybe convincing yourself that like this

1074
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
maybe convincing yourself that like this
 

1075
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,710
maybe convincing yourself that like this
piece can be lopped off in your function

1076
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
piece can be lopped off in your function
 

1077
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,830
piece can be lopped off in your function
calls um so you sort of have to do your

1078
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:32,840
calls um so you sort of have to do your
 

1079
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,549
calls um so you sort of have to do your
counting uh

1080
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
counting uh
 

1081
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,029
counting uh
carefully uh there's a different way to

1082
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
carefully uh there's a different way to
 

1083
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,950
carefully uh there's a different way to
uh implement the same thing so this

1084
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
uh implement the same thing so this
 

1085
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,470
uh implement the same thing so this
would be option b this is maybe more

1086
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
would be option b this is maybe more
 

1087
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,990
would be option b this is maybe more
efficient maybe less efficient depending

1088
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
efficient maybe less efficient depending
 

1089
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,510
efficient maybe less efficient depending
on your problem um but these are all

1090
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
on your problem um but these are all
 

1091
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,950
on your problem um but these are all
within constant factors of each other

1092
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
within constant factors of each other
 

1093
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,990
within constant factors of each other
for the most part not always but for the

1094
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,000
for the most part not always but for the
 

1095
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,470
for the most part not always but for the
most part this would be bottom

1096
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
most part this would be bottom
 

1097
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,430
most part this would be bottom
up and this is the idea of rather than

1098
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
up and this is the idea of rather than
 

1099
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,470
up and this is the idea of rather than
just taking our recursive algorithm that

1100
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:57,480
just taking our recursive algorithm that
 

1101
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,909
just taking our recursive algorithm that
we already know know and then just like

1102
00:22:58,909 --> 00:22:58,919
we already know know and then just like
 

1103
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,430
we already know know and then just like
checking a table to see like okay did I

1104
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
checking a table to see like okay did I
 

1105
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,830
checking a table to see like okay did I
already do this in this in that case

1106
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:02,840
already do this in this in that case
 

1107
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,990
already do this in this in that case
return it uh in the bottom up version

1108
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,000
return it uh in the bottom up version
 

1109
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,549
return it uh in the bottom up version
I'm going to build up my array XI J um

1110
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
I'm going to build up my array XI J um
 

1111
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,269
I'm going to build up my array XI J um
so there's no recursion at all um so

1112
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:12,279
so there's no recursion at all um so
 

1113
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,310
so there's no recursion at all um so
right so what would that look like so in

1114
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
right so what would that look like so in
 

1115
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,310
right so what would that look like so in
the bottom up case notice that in some

1116
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
the bottom up case notice that in some
 

1117
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,909
the bottom up case notice that in some
sense memorization is a top down

1118
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
sense memorization is a top down
 

1119
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,750
sense memorization is a top down
strategy right I would call it on N

1120
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
strategy right I would call it on N
 

1121
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,029
strategy right I would call it on N
comma n here we're going to start from

1122
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:22,039
comma n here we're going to start from
 

1123
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:24,190
comma n here we're going to start from
zero and work our way toward n right so

1124
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,200
zero and work our way toward n right so
 

1125
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,269
zero and work our way toward n right so
we'll start with x 0 J equals uh x

1126
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:31,279
we'll start with x 0 J equals uh x
 

1127
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,190
we'll start with x 0 J equals uh x
i0 equal 0 for all i j obviously I can

1128
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
i0 equal 0 for all i j obviously I can
 

1129
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,549

00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
do this with a
 

1131
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,590
do this with a
forloop uh and

1132
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:38,600
forloop uh and
 

1133
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,230
forloop uh and
now well remember if we think about our

previous JS right so it makes sense to

1138
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:46,679
previous JS right so it makes sense to
 

1139
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:53,710
previous JS right so it makes sense to
have an outer loop which is over

1149
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,710

1153
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,990

do you know our Loop over I and then

1154
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
do you know our Loop over I and then
 

1155
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,549
do you know our Loop over I and then
just have you know x j um and now you

1156
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
just have you know x j um and now you
 

1157
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,310
just have you know x j um and now you

he might just keep getting in line and

1308
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,200
he might just keep getting in line and
 

1309
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,669
he might just keep getting in line and
and and and getting more of that object

1310

um in addition to this uh just to make

1320
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:47,640
um in addition to this uh just to make
 

1321
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,950
um in addition to this uh just to make
this problem in my opinion slightly more

1322
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:49,960
this problem in my opinion slightly more
 

1323
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,149
this problem in my opinion slightly more
annoying and and point losing um Tim the

1324
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:53,159
annoying and and point losing um Tim the

beaver also takes one minute to get in
 

1327
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,230
beaver also takes one minute to get in
line at any booth um so we're just going

1328
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,240
line at any booth um so we're just going
 

1329
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,430
line at any booth um so we're just going
to have to remember that when we account

1330
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
to have to remember that when we account
 

1331
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,830
to have to remember that when we account
for our our time

1332
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:00,840

okay so uh let's continue adding some

1336
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,360
okay so uh let's continue adding some
 

1337
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,630
okay so uh let's continue adding some
more constants to our our problem so

1338
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,640
more constants to our our problem so
 

1339
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,870
more constants to our our problem so
each uh booth has an object which has

1340
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
each uh booth has an object which has
 

1341
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,430
each uh booth has an object which has
coolness CI weight wi time TI um Tim uh

1342
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
coolness CI weight wi time TI um Tim uh
 

1343
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,470
coolness CI weight wi time TI um Tim uh
is carrying a bag the

1344
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
is carrying a bag the
 

1345
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,149
is carrying a bag the
bag uh has uh can can hold uh a

1346

bag uh has uh can can hold uh a
 

1347
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,230
bag uh has uh can can hold uh a
particular weight B um so this is the

1348
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,240
particular weight B um so this is the
 

1349
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,950
particular weight B um so this is the
max weight

1350
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
max weight
 

1351
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,029
max weight
weight that Tim uh can hold in his bag

1352
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:32,039
weight that Tim uh can hold in his bag
 

1353
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,350
weight that Tim uh can hold in his bag
at any given

1354

time uh and
 

1357
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,430
time uh and
finally you know Tim is a a greedy

1358
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:38,440
finally you know Tim is a a greedy

week's problem session in the sense that
K is included in our runtime right but

1442
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
K is included in our runtime right but
 

1443
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,950
K is included in our runtime right but
like what is K it's just a number K

1444
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:37,960
like what is K it's just a number K
 

1445
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,350
like what is K it's just a number K
doesn't scale in the size of your

1446
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
doesn't scale in the size of your
 

1447
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,070
doesn't scale in the size of your
problem in a linear way um so it's it's

1448
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,080
problem in a linear way um so it's it's
 

1449
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,230
problem in a linear way um so it's it's
not going to matter for how we solve our

1450
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
not going to matter for how we solve our
 

1451
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,669
not going to matter for how we solve our
problem but it is just a feature that's

1452
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:45,679
problem but it is just a feature that's
 

1453
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,389
problem but it is just a feature that's
worth uh pointing

1454
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:47,399
worth uh pointing
 

1455
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,669
worth uh pointing
out okay so how do we solve uh dynamic

1456
00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:50,679
out okay so how do we solve uh dynamic
 

1457
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,870
out okay so how do we solve uh dynamic
programming problems we use a sword poot

1458
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:53,880
programming problems we use a sword poot
 

1459
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,389
programming problems we use a sword poot
um or a Senor uh BST uh if you are

1460
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:57,399
um or a Senor uh BST uh if you are
 

1461
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,070
um or a Senor uh BST uh if you are
watching previous iterations of this

1462
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,080
watching previous iterations of this
 

1463
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,750
watching previous iterations of this
course okay so uh right so let's let's

1464
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:02,760
course okay so uh right so let's let's
 

1465
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,549
course okay so uh right so let's let's
do

1466
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:03,559
do
 

1467
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,870
do
that see I'm trying to conserve board

1468
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:05,880
that see I'm trying to conserve board
 

1469
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,590
that see I'm trying to conserve board
space this is not going to end up uh

1470
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:08,600
space this is not going to end up uh
 

1471
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,870
space this is not going to end up uh
succeeding so again like what are all

1472
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
succeeding so again like what are all
 

1473
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,950
succeeding so again like what are all
the different sub problems here well

1474
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:13,960
the different sub problems here well
 

1475
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,590
the different sub problems here well
somehow what are what are the different

1476
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
somehow what are what are the different
 

1477
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,389
somehow what are what are the different
things that are are limiting Tim the

1478
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:17,399
things that are are limiting Tim the
 

1479
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,629
things that are are limiting Tim the
beaver you know what are what are his uh

1480
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:19,639
beaver you know what are what are his uh
 

1481
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:21,830
beaver you know what are what are his uh
constraints well he only has so much

1482
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,840
constraints well he only has so much
 

1483
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,110
constraints well he only has so much
time and somehow this is going to sound

1484
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,120
time and somehow this is going to sound
 

1485
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,629
time and somehow this is going to sound
more philosophical than I intend but you

1486
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:27,639
more philosophical than I intend but you
 

1487
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,310
more philosophical than I intend but you
know time always moves forward for Tim

1488
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,320
know time always moves forward for Tim
 

1489
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,070
know time always moves forward for Tim
the beaver so it's a pretty good

1490
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,080
the beaver so it's a pretty good
 

1491
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,950
the beaver so it's a pretty good
candidate uh in terms of of dynamic

1492
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:33,960
candidate uh in terms of of dynamic
 

1493
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,269
candidate uh in terms of of dynamic
programming because there's not going to

1494
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:35,279
programming because there's not going to
 

1495
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,149
programming because there's not going to
be some cyclical dependency remember

1496
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:37,159
be some cyclical dependency remember
 

1497
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,710
be some cyclical dependency remember
that in dynamic programming we're all

1498
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
that in dynamic programming we're all
 

1499
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,590
that in dynamic programming we're all
about trying to identify topological

1500
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:40,600
about trying to identify topological
 

1501
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,750
about trying to identify topological
orderings in our sub problems and when

1502
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:42,760
orderings in our sub problems and when
 

1503
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,110
orderings in our sub problems and when
you see something like time not only

1504
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
you see something like time not only
 

1505
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,669
you see something like time not only
does it also begin with t uh but it's

1506
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
does it also begin with t uh but it's
 

1507
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,350
does it also begin with t uh but it's
it's useful in the sense that time moves

1508
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,360
it's useful in the sense that time moves
 

1509
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,509
it's useful in the sense that time moves
forward uh there's never a case where

1510
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
forward uh there's never a case where
 

1511
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,549
forward uh there's never a case where
Tim the beaver you know purchases like a

1512
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
Tim the beaver you know purchases like a
 

1513
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,629
Tim the beaver you know purchases like a
weird warp speed airplane and somehow

1514
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:56,639
weird warp speed airplane and somehow
 

1515
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:59,029
weird warp speed airplane and somehow
goes back into in time um that that

1516
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
goes back into in time um that that
 

1517
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,149
goes back into in time um that that
doesn't happen in this particular

1518
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159
doesn't happen in this particular
 

1519
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,750
doesn't happen in this particular
homework problem and and for Tim the

1520
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
homework problem and and for Tim the
 

1521
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,909
homework problem and and for Tim the
beaver's sake I hope in in no homework

1522
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
beaver's sake I hope in in no homework
 

1523
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,590
beaver's sake I hope in in no homework
problems um so instead of the so so this

1524
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:07,600
problems um so instead of the so so this
 

1525
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,070
problems um so instead of the so so this
is a Long window way of saying that time

1526
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,080
is a Long window way of saying that time
 

1527
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,110
is a Long window way of saying that time
is a pretty reasonable uh uh constraint

1528
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
is a pretty reasonable uh uh constraint
 

1529
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,230
is a pretty reasonable uh uh constraint
to put in our problem or not constraint

1530
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,240
to put in our problem or not constraint
 

1531
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,909
to put in our problem or not constraint
as much as index I

1532
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:14,919
as much as index I
 

1533
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,990
as much as index I
guess moreover there's another thing

1534
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,000
guess moreover there's another thing
 

1535
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,789
guess moreover there's another thing
which is uh limiting Tim the beaver

1536
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799
which is uh limiting Tim the beaver
 

1537
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,590
which is uh limiting Tim the beaver
which is the capacity of his bag

1538
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:22,600
which is the capacity of his bag
 

1539
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,710
which is the capacity of his bag
remember he can only hold weight uh

1540
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
remember he can only hold weight uh
 

1541
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,470
remember he can only hold weight uh
B but this one should give you the

1542
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:27,480
B but this one should give you the
 

1543
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,590
B but this one should give you the
heebie jibbies a little bit because this

1544
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
heebie jibbies a little bit because this
 

1545
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,070
heebie jibbies a little bit because this
problem as a

1546
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,080
problem as a
 

1547
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,470
problem as a
Twist has allowed the bag to empty

1548
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,480
Twist has allowed the bag to empty
 

1549
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,029
Twist has allowed the bag to empty
itself out right so it's not true that

1550
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:37,039
itself out right so it's not true that
 

1551
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,710
itself out right so it's not true that
somehow you can come up with Sub sub

1552
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:39,720
somehow you can come up with Sub sub
 

1553
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,590
somehow you can come up with Sub sub
problems where um Tim the beaver is just

1554
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:42,600
problems where um Tim the beaver is just
 

1555
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,230
problems where um Tim the beaver is just
monotonically decreasing the weight of

1556
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
monotonically decreasing the weight of
 

1557
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,470
monotonically decreasing the weight of
his

1558
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:45,480
his
 

1559
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,549
his
bag however if he does choose to

1560
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
bag however if he does choose to
 

1561
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,549
bag however if he does choose to
decrease the weight of his bag he has to

1562
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:50,559
decrease the weight of his bag he has to
 

1563
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,070
decrease the weight of his bag he has to
spend time doing it so time continues to

1564
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,080
spend time doing it so time continues to
 

1565
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,710
spend time doing it so time continues to
move forward for Tim the beaver and

1566
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
move forward for Tim the beaver and
 

1567
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,950
move forward for Tim the beaver and
that's what's going to give us our our

1568
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:55,960
that's what's going to give us our our
 

1569
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,509
that's what's going to give us our our
topological order yeah this is a little

1570
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:58,519
topological order yeah this is a little
 

1571
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,389
topological order yeah this is a little
too philosophical I guess but in some

1572
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
too philosophical I guess but in some
 

1573
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,350
too philosophical I guess but in some
sense this is a long-winded way of

1574
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:02,360
sense this is a long-winded way of
 

1575
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,870
sense this is a long-winded way of
saying for our sbot Paradigm here um a

1576
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:05,880
saying for our sbot Paradigm here um a
 

1577
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,830
saying for our sbot Paradigm here um a
totally reasonable thing to do would be

1578
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
totally reasonable thing to do would be
 

1579
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,950
totally reasonable thing to do would be
to have x i

1580
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:10,960
to have x i
 

1581
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,710
to have x i
j uh I don't think in this class we do

1582
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:13,720
j uh I don't think in this class we do
 

1583
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,590
j uh I don't think in this class we do
this definition notation so just x i j

1584
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:16,600
this definition notation so just x i j
 

1585
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:23,149
this definition notation so just x i j
equals um the max

1586
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:23,159

 

1587
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,750

coolness um where he has I

1588
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:28,760
coolness um where he has I
 

1589
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,310
coolness um where he has I
minutes uh and he has J

1590
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,320

 

1591
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,870

weight let me glance at my answer to see

1592
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
weight let me glance at my answer to see
 

1593
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,870
weight let me glance at my answer to see
if it's left in his bag or weight that

1594
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
if it's left in his bag or weight that
 

1595
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,149
if it's left in his bag or weight that
he's carrying left in his bag either one

1596
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:43,159
he's carrying left in his bag either one
 

1597
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,269
he's carrying left in his bag either one
would make a reasonable uh problem I'm

1598
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
would make a reasonable uh problem I'm
 

1599
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,590
would make a reasonable uh problem I'm
just bad at looking at my notes and

1600
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
just bad at looking at my notes and
 

1601
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,870
just bad at looking at my notes and
seeing them disagree with the board so

1602
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:48,880
seeing them disagree with the board so
 

1603
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,470
seeing them disagree with the board so
I'm going to try and and and stay

1604
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
I'm going to try and and and stay
 

1605
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,789
I'm going to try and and and stay
consistent okay so XI is the MTC but in

00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:54,799
consistent okay so XI is the MTC but in

I minutes with J weight left rather than

1608
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
I minutes with J weight left rather than
 

1609
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,950
I minutes with J weight left rather than
in K minutes with B we which is going to

1610
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:00,960
in K minutes with B we which is going to
 

1611
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,950
in K minutes with B we which is going to
be our base uh problem okay oh no I did

1612
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:03,960
be our base uh problem okay oh no I did
 

1613
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,430
be our base uh problem okay oh no I did
it out of order like disregard that

1614
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:06,440
it out of order like disregard that
 

1615
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:16,069
it out of order like disregard that
we'll get to the b in a minute

1616
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:16,079

 

1617
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,270

okay okay so now uh so so that's our our

1618
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
okay okay so now uh so so that's our our
 

1619
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,790
okay okay so now uh so so that's our our
our our uh sub

1620
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:23,800

 

1621
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,510

problems so now uh let's do the r and

1622
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:26,520
problems so now uh let's do the r and
 

1623
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,190
problems so now uh let's do the r and
sort

1624
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,200

 

1625
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,149

hate this classroom so

1626
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:34,159

 

1627
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,869

much I'm sorry so right so so let's say

1628
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:37,879
much I'm sorry so right so so let's say
 

1629
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,950
much I'm sorry so right so so let's say
that that that Tim the beaver uh has has

1630
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:39,960
that that that Tim the beaver uh has has
 

1631
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,149
that that that Tim the beaver uh has has
IM minutes left in the clock uh and he

1632
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:42,159
IM minutes left in the clock uh and he
 

1633
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,149
IM minutes left in the clock uh and he
has J weight in his bag he's got a

1634
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
has J weight in his bag he's got a
 

1635
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,629
has J weight in his bag he's got a
number of actions that he can take yeah

1636
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:47,639
number of actions that he can take yeah
 

1637
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,869
number of actions that he can take yeah
uh and and let's think about what all

1638
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
uh and and let's think about what all
 

1639
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,629
uh and and let's think about what all
those actions are by the way there's one

1640
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:51,639
those actions are by the way there's one
 

1641
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,470
those actions are by the way there's one
thing that plausibly Tim the beaver

1642
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
thing that plausibly Tim the beaver
 

1643
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,710
thing that plausibly Tim the beaver
could do but he doesn't really need to

1644
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:56,720
could do but he doesn't really need to
 

1645
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,990
could do but he doesn't really need to
is is like do nothing now but then in 10

1646
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,000
is is like do nothing now but then in 10
 

1647
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,190
is is like do nothing now but then in 10
seconds do

1648
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,200
seconds do
 

1649
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,670
seconds do
something like it just you could do

1650
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:02,680
something like it just you could do
 

1651
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,790
something like it just you could do
account for that in this problem but

1652
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:03,800
account for that in this problem but
 

1653
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,829
account for that in this problem but
like there's there's sort of not a

1654
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:04,839
like there's there's sort of not a
 

1655
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,030
like there's there's sort of not a
reason right like he might as well stack

1656
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,040
reason right like he might as well stack
 

1657
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,950
reason right like he might as well stack
up all of his actions and then leave all

1658
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:07,960
up all of his actions and then leave all
 

1659
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,270
up all of his actions and then leave all
of his leftover time at the end um you

1660
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
of his leftover time at the end um you
 

1661
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,430
of his leftover time at the end um you
convince yourself that that's sort of

1662
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:12,440
convince yourself that that's sort of
 

1663
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,510
convince yourself that that's sort of
okay you know Tim prefers a compressed

1664
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:14,520
okay you know Tim prefers a compressed
 

1665
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,310
okay you know Tim prefers a compressed
uh schedule um right so he's he's got a

1666
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,320
uh schedule um right so he's he's got a
 

1667
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,990
uh schedule um right so he's he's got a
lot of energy this this Beaver it's what

1668
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,000
lot of energy this this Beaver it's what
 

1669
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,750
lot of energy this this Beaver it's what
they say their nature is uh construction

1670
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
they say their nature is uh construction
 

1671
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,670
they say their nature is uh construction
workers something

1672
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:24,680
workers something
 

1673
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,870
workers something
okay right so let's think about all of

1674
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:27,880
okay right so let's think about all of
 

1675
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,589
okay right so let's think about all of
our options so for one Tim the beaver

1676
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:30,599
our options so for one Tim the beaver
 

1677
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,829
our options so for one Tim the beaver
could not do a damn thing he could just

1678
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:32,839
could not do a damn thing he could just
 

1679
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,430
could not do a damn thing he could just
sit around for the rest of time and and

1680
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:34,440
sit around for the rest of time and and
 

1681
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,430
sit around for the rest of time and and
that would be perfectly fine so another

1682
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:36,440
that would be perfectly fine so another
 

1683
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,510
that would be perfectly fine so another
different way of putting that um is that

1684
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:38,520
different way of putting that um is that
 

1685
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,550
different way of putting that um is that
he could give up how much coolness would

1686
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:41,560
he could give up how much coolness would
 

1687
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,190
he could give up how much coolness would
Tim get from giving up zero that's right

1688
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
Tim get from giving up zero that's right
 

1689
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,790
Tim get from giving up zero that's right
kids giving up makes you zero cool um so

1690
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:49,800
kids giving up makes you zero cool um so
 

1691
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,430
kids giving up makes you zero cool um so
okay uh right so um Tim the beaver is

1692
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:52,440
okay uh right so um Tim the beaver is
 

1693
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,270
okay uh right so um Tim the beaver is
trying to maximize uh he has a lot of

1694
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,280
trying to maximize uh he has a lot of
 

1695
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,069
trying to maximize uh he has a lot of
different options one of them is zero

1696
00:35:59,069 --> 00:35:59,079

 

1697
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,030

meaning he gave

1698
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,040
meaning he gave
 

1699
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,750
meaning he gave
up right notice he could recurse like X

1700
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
up right notice he could recurse like X
 

1701
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,430
up right notice he could recurse like X
I guess what would be you know he could

1702
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440
I guess what would be you know he could
 

1703
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,550
I guess what would be you know he could
give up for one minute right and have

1704
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:09,560
give up for one minute right and have
 

1705
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,109
give up for one minute right and have
that be X IUS one J or something um

1706
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
that be X IUS one J or something um
 

1707
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,990
that be X IUS one J or something um
forget if I'm going to do i+ one or IUS

1708
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,000
forget if I'm going to do i+ one or IUS
 

1709
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,510
forget if I'm going to do i+ one or IUS
one I minus one

1710
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:16,520
one I minus one
 

1711
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,790
one I minus one
J but there's no reason like he can just

1712
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:18,800
J but there's no reason like he can just
 

1713
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,390
J but there's no reason like he can just
give up and and stop like that would

1714
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
give up and and stop like that would
 

1715
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,309
give up and and stop like that would
just be extra recursive calls for For No

1716
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:22,319
just be extra recursive calls for For No
 

1717
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:23,030
just be extra recursive calls for For No
Good

1718
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
Good
 

1719
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,230
Good
Reason okay the next thing that he could

1720
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,240
Reason okay the next thing that he could
 

1721
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,069
Reason okay the next thing that he could
do is he could get in for a booth right

1722
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:29,079
do is he could get in for a booth right
 

1723
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,550
do is he could get in for a booth right
um so first let's work out what happens

1724
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:31,560
um so first let's work out what happens
 

1725
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,069
um so first let's work out what happens
uh then so for one um he gets coolness

1726
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:35,079
uh then so for one um he gets coolness
 

1727
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:37,270
uh then so for one um he gets coolness
let's say that he gets into Booth K so

1728
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:37,280
let's say that he gets into Booth K so
 

1729
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,910
let's say that he gets into Booth K so
he gets coolness CK when he does

1730
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:39,920
he gets coolness CK when he does
 

1731
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,470
he gets coolness CK when he does
that and now he can recurse so first we

1732
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:43,480
that and now he can recurse so first we
 

1733
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,750
that and now he can recurse so first we
have to account for the time so it takes

1734
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
have to account for the time so it takes
 

1735
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,390
have to account for the time so it takes
I so it takes TK that's a

1736
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,400
I so it takes TK that's a
 

1737
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,790
I so it takes TK that's a
t time or does it no because it takes an

1738
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:53,800
t time or does it no because it takes an
 

1739
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,349
t time or does it no because it takes an
extra minute for him to get in the next

1740
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
extra minute for him to get in the next
 

1741
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,109
extra minute for him to get in the next
line or to get in this line line I guess

1742
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
line or to get in this line line I guess
 

1743
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,589
line or to get in this line line I guess
this is better um and

1744
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
this is better um and
 

1745
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,589
this is better um and
moreover uh he needs to account for J

1746
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
moreover uh he needs to account for J
 

1747
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,349
moreover uh he needs to account for J
minus WK like that can he always do this

1748
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:09,359
minus WK like that can he always do this
 

1749
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,790
minus WK like that can he always do this
no he needs to have this much time

1750
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:11,800
no he needs to have this much time
 

1751
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,309
no he needs to have this much time
remaining and he needs this much time in

1752
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:14,319
remaining and he needs this much time in
 

1753
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:15,829
remaining and he needs this much time in
his bag

1754
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
his bag
 

1755
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,589
his bag
or this much weight remaining in his bag

1756
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:19,599
or this much weight remaining in his bag
 

1757
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,710
or this much weight remaining in his bag
um you guys can work out the inequality

1758
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:21,720
um you guys can work out the inequality
 

1759
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,230
um you guys can work out the inequality
but since I only have a foot here I'll

1760
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:23,240
but since I only have a foot here I'll
 

1761
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,589
but since I only have a foot here I'll
just say if

1762
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:25,599
just say if
 

1763
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,390
just say if
applicable

1764
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:27,400
applicable
 

1765
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,630
applicable
this is a great way to lose points on

1766
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
this is a great way to lose points on
 

1767
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,790
this is a great way to lose points on
your homework uh but for Board Writing

1768
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:30,800
your homework uh but for Board Writing
 

1769
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,109
your homework uh but for Board Writing
it's okay so so when I say applicable I

1770
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
it's okay so so when I say applicable I
 

1771
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,349
it's okay so so when I say applicable I
mean these two numbers have better be

1772
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:34,359
mean these two numbers have better be
 

1773
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,430
mean these two numbers have better be
greater than or equal to zero okay uh

1774
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:37,440
greater than or equal to zero okay uh
 

1775
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,750
greater than or equal to zero okay uh
and you can do this for all K right so

1776
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
and you can do this for all K right so
 

1777
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,990
and you can do this for all K right so
in other words he can choose to get into

he can go home okay so what happens if
 

1785
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,109
he can go home okay so what happens if
he goes home does he is he cool when he

1786
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,119
he goes home does he is he cool when he
 

1787
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,589
he goes home does he is he cool when he
does Tim the beaver get cooler when he

1788
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:52,599
does Tim the beaver get cooler when he
 

1789
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,470
does Tim the beaver get cooler when he
goes home

no I'm afraid to to to say so

1792
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:58,440
no I'm afraid to to to say so
 

1793

no I'm afraid to to to say so
um in par but he does spend time yeah so

1794
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
um in par but he does spend time yeah so
 

1795
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,630
um in par but he does spend time yeah so
how much time does he

1796
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:04,640
how much time does he
 

1797
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,150

that he should have lost coolness by

1802
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:13,880
that he should have lost coolness by
 

1803
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,190
that he should have lost coolness by
going home no home is cool guys

1804
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,200
going home no home is cool guys
 

1805
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,510
going home no home is cool guys
especially this semester stay home stay

1806
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,520
especially this semester stay home stay
 

1807
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,550

indoors um so he he uh right so he he

1808
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
indoors um so he he uh right so he he
 

1809
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,790

1811
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,990
loses home time H and one to get in the
next line okay um but you know he's got

1812
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
next line okay um but you know he's got
 

1813
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,750
next line okay um but you know he's got
a devil's bargain of sorts uh he he he

1814
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:32,760
a devil's bargain of sorts uh he he he
 

1815
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,630
a devil's bargain of sorts uh he he he
loses time but he gains bag bagginess

1816
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:36,640
loses time but he gains bag bagginess
 

1817

00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
way of saying that is IUS H minus one is
 

1833
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,670
way of saying that is IUS H minus one is
greater than equal to zero which is

greater than equal to zero which is
 

1835
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,790
greater than equal to zero which is
really what's applicable in our

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,630
really what's applicable in our

was reading the answer here okay and

1844
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:05,319
was reading the answer here okay and
 

1845
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:06,670
was reading the answer here okay and
those are all the options for Tim the

1846
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:06,680
those are all the options for Tim the
 

1847
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,030
those are all the options for Tim the
beaver yeah um notice that every one of

1848
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,040
beaver yeah um notice that every one of
 

1849
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,349
beaver yeah um notice that every one of
our options either gives up

1850
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:12,359
our options either gives up
 

1851
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:17,349
our options either gives up
completely or decreases time so we have

1852
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:17,359
completely or decreases time so we have
 

1853
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,470
completely or decreases time so we have
our topological order which is again

1854
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,480
our topological order which is again
 

1855
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,589
our topological order which is again
that the arrow of time always continues

1856
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:22,599
that the arrow of time always continues
 

1857
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,270
that the arrow of time always continues
to move forward I'm going to prove that

1858
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:24,280
to move forward I'm going to prove that
 

1859
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,990
to move forward I'm going to prove that

to the letter T again on your homework

1862
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:28,359
to the letter T again on your homework
 

1863
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:30,349
to the letter T again on your homework
you should write out your answers uh

1864
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:30,359
you should write out your answers uh
 

1865
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,950
you should write out your answers uh
what is our base case for

1866
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:32,960
what is our base case for
 

1867
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,829
what is our base case for
Tim

1868
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:34,839
Tim
 

1869
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,190

well how much coolness do you get if you

1870
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,200
well how much coolness do you get if you
 

1871
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,390
well how much coolness do you get if you
have no time zero coolness that's how

1872
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:41,400
have no time zero coolness that's how
 

1873
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,069
have no time zero coolness that's how
much um

1874
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:46,079

 

1875
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,829

so we have this expression x0j equals z

1876
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:49,839
so we have this expression x0j equals z
 

1877
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,309
so we have this expression x0j equals z
for all J incidentally um although it's

1878
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:54,319
for all J incidentally um although it's
 

1879
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:55,870
for all J incidentally um although it's
perfectly fine to have this be your your

1880
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:55,880
perfectly fine to have this be your your
 

1881
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,829
perfectly fine to have this be your your
base case you actually in some sense

1882
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
base case you actually in some sense
 

1883
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,470
base case you actually in some sense
didn't need it because Tim the beaver

1884
00:39:59,470 --> 00:39:59,480
didn't need it because Tim the beaver
 

1885
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,829
didn't need it because Tim the beaver
always had the option of giving up um so

1886
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
always had the option of giving up um so
 

1887
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,069
always had the option of giving up um so
you could I guess in this problem have

1888
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:03,079
you could I guess in this problem have
 

1889
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,190
you could I guess in this problem have
no base case if you really wanted um

1890
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
no base case if you really wanted um
 

1891
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,550
no base case if you really wanted um
would be okay but kind of

1892
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:07,560
would be okay but kind of
 

1893
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,670
would be okay but kind of
weird um

1894
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:09,680
weird um
 

1895
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,510
weird um
okay what's our original problem well he

1896
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:12,520
okay what's our original problem well he
 

1897
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,990
okay what's our original problem well he
starts out with time K and weight uh

1898
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
starts out with time K and weight uh
 

1899
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,030
starts out with time K and weight uh
capacity B in his bag so it's x k b and

1900
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
capacity B in his bag so it's x k b and
 

1901
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,950
capacity B in his bag so it's x k b and
then finally uh we need to do our

1902
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
then finally uh we need to do our
 

1903
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,190
then finally uh we need to do our
runtime

1904
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,200
runtime
 

1905
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,550
runtime
analysis so how many sub problems are

1906
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
analysis so how many sub problems are
 

1907
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,710
analysis so how many sub problems are
there well again I sub problem is

1908
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:28,720
there well again I sub problem is
 

1909
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,550
there well again I sub problem is
basically just the number of indexes for

1910
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
basically just the number of indexes for
 

1911
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,109
basically just the number of indexes for
for most of our our dynamic programming

1912
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:32,119
for most of our our dynamic programming
 

1913
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:35,309
for most of our our dynamic programming
problems right so there's

1914
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:35,319
problems right so there's
 

1915
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:38,870
problems right so there's
um so the first index is time the second

1916
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:38,880
um so the first index is time the second
 

1917
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,270
um so the first index is time the second
one is bag size this is always between

1918
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
one is bag size this is always between
 

1919
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,910
one is bag size this is always between
zero and B this is always between zero

1920
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:44,920
zero and B this is always between zero
 

1921
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,670
zero and B this is always between zero
and K so there's order k b sub

1922
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:50,680
and K so there's order k b sub
 

1923
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,230
and K so there's order k b sub
problems um how much time does each sub

1924
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
problems um how much time does each sub
 

1925
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,950
problems um how much time does each sub
problem take well notice that I have to

1926
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:55,960
problem take well notice that I have to
 

1927
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,910
problem take well notice that I have to
lose

1928
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:56,920
lose
 

1929
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,790
lose
over all of my different options K here

1930
00:40:59,790 --> 00:40:59,800
over all of my different options K here
 

1931
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,990
over all of my different options K here
so I

1932
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,000

 

1933
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,589

incur oh I'm

1934
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:06,599
incur oh I'm
 

1935
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,230
incur oh I'm
noticing K is abused in our answer to

1936
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,240
noticing K is abused in our answer to
 

1937
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,710
noticing K is abused in our answer to
this problem we should use K only

1938
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:11,720
this problem we should use K only
 

1939
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,829
this problem we should use K only
once okay so here's here's here's where

1940
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:14,839
once okay so here's here's here's where
 

1941
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,309
once okay so here's here's here's where
uh I made a mistake and I believe it's

1942
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:16,319
uh I made a mistake and I believe it's
 

1943
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,589
uh I made a mistake and I believe it's
in the written solution but I'm not

1944
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:17,599
in the written solution but I'm not
 

1945
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,910
in the written solution but I'm not
going to check now um there's K which is

1946
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
going to check now um there's K which is
 

1947
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,510
going to check now um there's K which is
the total time that Tim the beaver has

1948
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520
the total time that Tim the beaver has
 

1949
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,430
the total time that Tim the beaver has
and there's the K that I use as an index

1950
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
and there's the K that I use as an index
 

1951
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,710
and there's the K that I use as an index
here and those are are not the same I

1952
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:25,720
here and those are are not the same I
 

1953
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,270
here and those are are not the same I
guess I can make this K Bar really

1954
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
guess I can make this K Bar really
 

1955
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,630
guess I can make this K Bar really
fast there you go problem

1956
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:31,640
fast there you go problem
 

1957
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,790
fast there you go problem
solve and I just noticed that because I

1958
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:33,800
solve and I just noticed that because I
 

1959
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,710
solve and I just noticed that because I
was doing my runtime and it's not order

1960
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:35,720
was doing my runtime and it's not order
 

1961
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,870
was doing my runtime and it's not order
k um it's the loop over all the K

1962
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:39,880
k um it's the loop over all the K
 

1963
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,390
k um it's the loop over all the K
bars how many K bars are there well

1964
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
bars how many K bars are there well
 

1965
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,550

these are all the different booths and

1966
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:43,560
these are all the different booths and
 

1967
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,390
these are all the different booths and
there's order n of those so this is

1968
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,400
there's order n of those so this is
 

1969
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,870
there's order n of those so this is
order n time per sub problem which gives

1970
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:51,880
order n time per sub problem which gives
 

1971
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,109
order n time per sub problem which gives
me a total runtime of order K

1972
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
me a total runtime of order K
 

1973
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,030
me a total runtime of order K
BN um which I believe uh oh our desired

1974
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,040

1975
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,670

run time was order nbk but I think we

1976
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:02,680
run time was order nbk but I think we
 

1977
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,190
run time was order nbk but I think we
can convince ourselves that indeed those

1978
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:04,200
can convince ourselves that indeed those
 

1979
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,430
can convince ourselves that indeed those
are are the same thing okay so my

about this one notice that both of these

1998
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:26,319
about this one notice that both of these
 

1999
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,069
about this one notice that both of these
problems are are very similar in nature

2000
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
problems are are very similar in nature
 

2001
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,630
problems are are very similar in nature
I basically just wrote sub Problems

2002
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:29,640
I basically just wrote sub Problems
 

2003
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,910
I basically just wrote sub Problems
indexed by every possible thing uh and

2004
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920
indexed by every possible thing uh and
 

2005
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,230
indexed by every possible thing uh and
then enumerated every possible solution

2006
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,240
then enumerated every possible solution
 

2007
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,750
then enumerated every possible solution
U I think this is totally sensible like

2008
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:36,760
U I think this is totally sensible like
 

2009
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,309
U I think this is totally sensible like
I again I remember I had a math

2010

use this phrase like it's important not

2014
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:40,839
use this phrase like it's important not
 

2015
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:43,150
use this phrase like it's important not
to think here um and and I think this is

2016
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,160
to think here um and and I think this is
 

2017
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,990
to think here um and and I think this is
is absolutely true uh for these dynamic

2018
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:45,000
is absolutely true uh for these dynamic
 

2019

is absolutely true uh for these dynamic
programming problems somehow they look a

2020
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:46,480
programming problems somehow they look a
 

2021
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,630
programming problems somehow they look a
lot more complicated than they

2022
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
lot more complicated than they

parsing ah yeah so this one

2026
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:57,160
parsing ah yeah so this one
 

2027
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,710

this one also got me tripped up for a

2028
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:58,720
this one also got me tripped up for a
 

2029
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,589
this one also got me tripped up for a
minute because the runtime they want is

2030
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:00,599
minute because the runtime they want is
 

2031
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:03,270
minute because the runtime they want is
not the runtime of the obvious solution

2032
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:03,280
not the runtime of the obvious solution
 

2033
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,950
not the runtime of the obvious solution
but it kind of sort of is after a little

2034
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:04,960
but it kind of sort of is after a little
 

2035
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,150
but it kind of sort of is after a little
bit of uh uh fixing okay so uh Professor

DNA Tada um okay so let me go to my

2042
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
DNA Tada um okay so let me go to my
 

2043
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,990
DNA Tada um okay so let me go to my
notes here because I think they're

2044
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:23,000
notes here because I think they're
 

2045
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,470
notes here because I think they're
easier to

2046
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
easier to
 

2047
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,829
easier to
read right so a of DNA as we all know

2048
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
read right so a of DNA as we all know
 

2049
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,270
read right so a of DNA as we all know
because we're MIT

00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
right so we have a strand of DNA is
 

2073
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,270
right so we have a strand of DNA is
basically a long string of characters

00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:00,280
basically a long string of characters
 

2075
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,990
basically a long string of characters
that are one of four options I'm told

2076
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
that are one of four options I'm told
 

2077
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,150
that are one of four options I'm told
that there's sometimes like a fifth and

2078
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,160
that there's sometimes like a fifth and
 

2079
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,829
that there's sometimes like a fifth and
a sixth option but not too often this

2080
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:04,839
a sixth option but not too often this
 

2081
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,430
a sixth option but not too often this
problem there's not um and uh moreover

2082
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:09,440
problem there's not um and uh moreover
 

2083
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,549
problem there's not um and uh moreover
um so a strand can be cut up so I have

2084
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:12,559
um so a strand can be cut up so I have
 

2085
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:14,309
um so a strand can be cut up so I have
this big long Strand and I'm looking for

2086
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
this big long Strand and I'm looking for
 

2087
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,109
this big long Strand and I'm looking for
certain like markers in particular I

2088
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:17,119
certain like markers in particular I
 

2089
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,190
certain like markers in particular I
have a

2090
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:18,200
have a
 

2091
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,630
have a
list P of uh

2092
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
list P of uh
 

2093
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,150
list P of uh
markers um which are really a sequence

2094
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:27,160
markers um which are really a sequence
 

2095
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:34,510
markers um which are really a sequence
of less than or equal to K uh

2096
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:34,520

 

2097
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,230

nucleotides by the way this really is uh

2098
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:37,240
nucleotides by the way this really is uh
 

2099
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,710
nucleotides by the way this really is uh
something that the people do like like

2100
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720
something that the people do like like
 

2101
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,109
something that the people do like like
string searching really is applicable to

2102
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119
string searching really is applicable to
 

2103
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,790
string searching really is applicable to
processing the these DNA strands

2104
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:42,800
processing the these DNA strands
 

2105
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,829
processing the these DNA strands
obviously I think in in practice these

2106
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:44,839
obviously I think in in practice these
 

2107
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:45,910
obviously I think in in practice these
techniques have to be a lot more

2108
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:45,920
techniques have to be a lot more
 

2109
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,190
techniques have to be a lot more
resilient to error um but really A lot

2110
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,200
resilient to error um but really A lot
 

2111
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,589
resilient to error um but really A lot
of these algorithm recovering are not

2112
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:50,599
of these algorithm recovering are not
 

2113
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,750
of these algorithm recovering are not
all that far off from from how people

2114
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:52,760
all that far off from from how people
 

2115
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,230
all that far off from from how people
process these giant data sets which is

2116
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:55,240
process these giant data sets which is
 

2117
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,910
process these giant data sets which is
pretty cool I think um okay so what are

2118
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
pretty cool I think um okay so what are
 

2119
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,910
pretty cool I think um okay so what are
we going to do we have uh a string uh

2120
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:02,920
we going to do we have uh a string uh
 

2121
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,109
we going to do we have uh a string uh
and then we're going to make a division

2122
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:07,119

 

2123
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,710

um so we'll call our string s and our

2124
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:09,720
um so we'll call our string s and our
 

2125
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,910
um so we'll call our string s and our
division D um which kind of looks like

2126
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:13,920
division D um which kind of looks like
 

2127
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,790
division D um which kind of looks like
D1 to

2128
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:15,800
D1 to
 

2129
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,829
D1 to
DM which are uh

2130
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:18,839
DM which are uh
 

2131
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:21,829
DM which are uh
substrings uh that concatenate to make

2132
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
substrings uh that concatenate to make
 

2133
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,870
substrings uh that concatenate to make
uh uh the full the full

2134
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:24,880
uh uh the full the full
 

2135
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,309
uh uh the full the full
guy

2136
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319

 

2137
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,670

so if s is our our our input string then

2138
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:34,680
so if s is our our our input string then
 

2139
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,670
so if s is our our our input string then
a division D is just like chopping up S

2140
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:36,680
a division D is just like chopping up S
 

2141
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,670
a division D is just like chopping up S
into little substrings uh Each of which

2142
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:38,680
into little substrings uh Each of which
 

2143
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,150
into little substrings uh Each of which
we can give a name Little D here so big

2144
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:41,160
we can give a name Little D here so big
 

2145
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,109
we can give a name Little D here so big
D is the full uh division Little D is is

2146
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
D is the full uh division Little D is is
 

2147
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,470
D is the full uh division Little D is is
all the little pieces you know there's

2148
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:47,480
all the little pieces you know there's
 

2149
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,950
all the little pieces you know there's
that that old song about going through

2150
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
that that old song about going through
 

2151
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,870
that that old song about going through
the Big D and do me Dallas I think it's

2152
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:51,880
the Big D and do me Dallas I think it's
 

2153
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,349
the Big D and do me Dallas I think it's
for divorce I don't know um right so uh

2154
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
for divorce I don't know um right so uh
 

2155
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,510
for divorce I don't know um right so uh
okay

2156
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:56,520
okay
 

2157
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,990
okay
so the

2158
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000
so the
 

2159
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,109
so the
value of a

2160
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:02,119

 

2161
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:07,470

division is the number of uh

2162
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:07,480
division is the number of uh
 

2163
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,270
division is the number of uh
strands so strands are these little D's

2164
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:10,280
strands so strands are these little D's
 

2165
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,109
strands so strands are these little D's
here

2166
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:12,119
here
 

2167
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:17,750
here
um that are in our list uh P okay uh and

2168
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,760
um that are in our list uh P okay uh and
 

2169
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,109
um that are in our list uh P okay uh and
so uh right so given S and P what we

2170
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:21,119
so uh right so given S and P what we
 

2171
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,790
so uh right so given S and P what we
want is the max

2172
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:24,800

 

2173
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,790

value

2174
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:26,800
value
 

2175
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,670
value
and the runtime that we're budgeted is

2176
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680
and the runtime that we're budgeted is
 

2177
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,349
and the runtime that we're budgeted is
kind of a weird runtime and this should

2178
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:31,359
kind of a weird runtime and this should
 

2179
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,230
kind of a weird runtime and this should
make us a little suspicious um so the

2180
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:34,240
make us a little suspicious um so the
 

2181
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,030
make us a little suspicious um so the
the max value is Big

2182
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,040
the max value is Big
 

2183
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,270
the max value is Big
O of I think I wrote it slightly

2184
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:40,280
O of I think I wrote it slightly
 

2185
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,030
O of I think I wrote it slightly
differently in the problem but whatever

2186
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:42,040
differently in the problem but whatever
 

2187
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,190
differently in the problem but whatever
I distributed a

2188
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:44,200
I distributed a
 

2189
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,950
I distributed a
k like that so it's K mod P uh plus k^ s

2190
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:47,960
k like that so it's K mod P uh plus k^ s
 

2191
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,390
k like that so it's K mod P uh plus k^ s
mod s right so so we have two terms here

2192
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:50,400
mod s right so so we have two terms here
 

2193
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,910
mod s right so so we have two terms here
which somehow smells funny in dynamic

2194
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:53,920
which somehow smells funny in dynamic
 

2195
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,950
which somehow smells funny in dynamic
programming okay

2196
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
programming okay
 

2197
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,430
programming okay
so what are we to do well what I did is

2198
00:46:59,430 --> 00:46:59,440
so what are we to do well what I did is
 

2199
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,309
so what are we to do well what I did is
I ignored our desired runtime came up

2200
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:02,319
I ignored our desired runtime came up
 

2201
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,790
I ignored our desired runtime came up
with a dynamic program noticed that it

2202
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
with a dynamic program noticed that it
 

2203
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,549
with a dynamic program noticed that it
was a little wrong and then fixed it by

2204
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:07,559
was a little wrong and then fixed it by
 

2205
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:08,870
was a little wrong and then fixed it by
wrong I mean it was it was correct it

2206
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,880
wrong I mean it was it was correct it
 

2207
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,470
wrong I mean it was it was correct it
just wasn't fast enough okay so let's do

2208
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:11,480
just wasn't fast enough okay so let's do
 

2209
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,790
just wasn't fast enough okay so let's do
version one

2210
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:15,800

 

2211
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,790

here

2212
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:17,800
here
 

2213
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,030
here
1.0 that makes it more

2214
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:20,040
1.0 that makes it more
 

2215
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,309
1.0 that makes it more
accurate um they're more precise right I

2216
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:23,319
accurate um they're more precise right I
 

2217
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:26,470
accurate um they're more precise right I
always confuse those two uh so so here's

2218
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
always confuse those two uh so so here's
 

2219
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,750
always confuse those two uh so so here's
a sort of thing that it's going to be a

2220
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:28,760
a sort of thing that it's going to be a
 

2221
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,030
a sort of thing that it's going to be a
little bit funny because it's going to

2222
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:30,040
little bit funny because it's going to
 

2223
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,190
little bit funny because it's going to
look like we're going to have an easy

2224
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:31,200
look like we're going to have an easy
 

2225
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,309
look like we're going to have an easy
computational problem but then it's

2226
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:33,319
computational problem but then it's
 

2227
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:34,750
computational problem but then it's
going to turn out that it's actually too

2228
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:34,760
going to turn out that it's actually too
 

2229
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,990
going to turn out that it's actually too
slow so in particular uh in our s in

2230
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,000
slow so in particular uh in our s in
 

2231
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,390
slow so in particular uh in our s in
sbot um what we could do is

2232
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:41,400
sbot um what we could do is
 

2233
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,109
sbot um what we could do is
say XI is going to be the

2234
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
say XI is going to be the
 

2235
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,790
say XI is going to be the
max

2236
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:46,800
max
 

2237
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,710
max
value of a

2238
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:49,720
value of a
 

2239
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,990
value of a
suffix if you're wondering I don't know

2240
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
suffix if you're wondering I don't know
 

2241
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,510
suffix if you're wondering I don't know
the difference between prefix and suffix

2242
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
the difference between prefix and suffix
 

2243
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,950
the difference between prefix and suffix
but I wrote the word suffix in my notes

2244
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
but I wrote the word suffix in my notes
 

2245
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,510
but I wrote the word suffix in my notes
and checked it at home

2246
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:56,520
and checked it at home
 

2247
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,430
and checked it at home
um s i comma colon see it's suffix

2248
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:00,440
um s i comma colon see it's suffix
 

2249
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,829
um s i comma colon see it's suffix
because it starts at I and it goes to

2250
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:01,839
because it starts at I and it goes to
 

2251
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,270
because it starts at I and it goes to
the end huh no

2252
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:05,280
the end huh no
 

2253
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,069
the end huh no
comma in mat lab it would be a comma and

2254
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:09,079
comma in mat lab it would be a comma and
 

2255
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:14,270
comma in mat lab it would be a comma and
that's a colon and that's an i okay

2256
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:14,280
that's a colon and that's an i okay
 

2257
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,670
that's a colon and that's an i okay
thanks um I'm inventing my own

2258
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:16,680
thanks um I'm inventing my own
 

2259
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,990
thanks um I'm inventing my own
programming language on the board as we

2260
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,000
programming language on the board as we
 

2261
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,670
programming language on the board as we
go

2262
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:18,680
go
 

2263
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,030
go
today all right so um and notice this is

2264
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:22,040
today all right so um and notice this is
 

2265
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,710
today all right so um and notice this is
kind of a reasonable set of sub problems

2266
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:23,720
kind of a reasonable set of sub problems
 

2267
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,030
kind of a reasonable set of sub problems
right because kind of obviously if I if

2268
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:25,040
right because kind of obviously if I if
 

2269
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,109
right because kind of obviously if I if
I Lop off off you you know some some

2270
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:28,119
I Lop off off you you know some some
 

2271
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:29,990
I Lop off off you you know some some
piece of my string then the max value I

2272
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,000
piece of my string then the max value I
 

2273
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,950
piece of my string then the max value I
can get is just the the value of

2274
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:31,960
can get is just the the value of
 

2275
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,829
can get is just the the value of
whatever remains yeah so spiritually

2276
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:34,839
whatever remains yeah so spiritually
 

2277
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:37,870
whatever remains yeah so spiritually
this somehow feels like the right uh uh

2278
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:37,880
this somehow feels like the right uh uh
 

2279
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,470
this somehow feels like the right uh uh
dynamic programming and indeed we'll see

2280
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:39,480
dynamic programming and indeed we'll see
 

2281
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,990
dynamic programming and indeed we'll see
that it is but it it just requires a

2282
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:41,000
that it is but it it just requires a
 

2283
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,150
that it is but it it just requires a
little bit of liptick at the end to to

2284
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,160
little bit of liptick at the end to to
 

2285
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,190
little bit of liptick at the end to to
run in the right time okay so let's do

2286
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:47,200
run in the right time okay so let's do
 

2287
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,430
run in the right time okay so let's do
our recursive call and this is actually

2288
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,440
our recursive call and this is actually
 

2289
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,950
our recursive call and this is actually
straightforward

2290
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:52,960
straightforward
 

2291
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,950
straightforward
um at least the sort of recursive call

2292
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:55,960
um at least the sort of recursive call
 

2293
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,230
um at least the sort of recursive call
that you want to make uh is

2294
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:57,240
that you want to make uh is
 

2295
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,390
that you want to make uh is
straightforward and then we'll see that

2296
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,400
straightforward and then we'll see that
 

2297
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,990
straightforward and then we'll see that
there's an equivalent formula which is

2298
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000
there's an equivalent formula which is
 

2299
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,789
there's an equivalent formula which is
the one you'll see in the solution which

2300
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:01,799
the one you'll see in the solution which
 

2301
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:03,789
the one you'll see in the solution which
looks more complicated but is is the

2302
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:03,799
looks more complicated but is is the
 

2303
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:05,750
looks more complicated but is is the
same thing so I'm going to write it as

2304
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760
same thing so I'm going to write it as
 

2305
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,870
same thing so I'm going to write it as
pseudo code for a recursive call rather

2306
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:07,880
pseudo code for a recursive call rather
 

2307
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,349
pseudo code for a recursive call rather
than as one giant formula because I

2308
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:09,359
than as one giant formula because I
 

2309
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,390
than as one giant formula because I
think it's easier to follow not pseudo

2310
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:11,400
think it's easier to follow not pseudo
 

2311
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,549
think it's easier to follow not pseudo
code I know that's that's frowned upon

2312
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:12,559
code I know that's that's frowned upon
 

2313
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,750
code I know that's that's frowned upon
in this class a a a description of a set

2314
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:15,760
in this class a a a description of a set
 

2315
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,750
in this class a a a description of a set
of steps for obtaining our recursive

2316
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
of steps for obtaining our recursive
 

2317
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,109
of steps for obtaining our recursive
call rather than um a formula so in

2318
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:21,119
call rather than um a formula so in
 

2319
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,270
call rather than um a formula so in
particular uh we're going to initialize

2320
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
particular uh we're going to initialize
 

2321
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,069
particular uh we're going to initialize
XI to be zero

2322
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079

 

2323
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,549

uh we want to do a maximization problem

2324
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:30,559
uh we want to do a maximization problem
 

2325
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,270
uh we want to do a maximization problem
so initializing a variable to zero is a

2326
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:32,280
so initializing a variable to zero is a
 

2327
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,190
so initializing a variable to zero is a
sensible thing to do and remember what

2328
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
sensible thing to do and remember what
 

2329
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,470
sensible thing to do and remember what
what can we do here so we're looking at

2330
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:36,480
what can we do here so we're looking at
 

2331
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,030
what can we do here so we're looking at
a suffix I could go down my list P of

2332
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:40,040
a suffix I could go down my list P of
 

2333
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,990
a suffix I could go down my list P of
all the different markers see if any of

2334
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:42,000
all the different markers see if any of
 

2335
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,829
all the different markers see if any of
them matches the first couple characters

2336
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:43,839
them matches the first couple characters
 

2337
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,710
them matches the first couple characters
of my string if it does I get some value

2338
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:46,720
of my string if it does I get some value
 

2339
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,990
of my string if it does I get some value
and then I hop on to the next thing does

2340
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:49,000
and then I hop on to the next thing does
 

2341
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,510
and then I hop on to the next thing does
that make sense

2342
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:54,520

 

2343
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,670

um oops I'm realizing I have a slight

2344
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:57,680
um oops I'm realizing I have a slight
 

2345
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,870
um oops I'm realizing I have a slight
mistake here um rather than initializing

2346
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
mistake here um rather than initializing
 

2347
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,470
mistake here um rather than initializing
to

2348
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:03,480

 

2349
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,630

zero I actually have one additional

2350
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:05,640
zero I actually have one additional
 

2351
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,230
zero I actually have one additional
option that I forgot to account for

2352
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:07,240
option that I forgot to account for
 

2353
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,549
option that I forgot to account for
which is I could just not use this

2354
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559
which is I could just not use this
 

2355
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,950
which is I could just not use this
character I could I could I could put it

2356
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:09,960
character I could I could I could put it
 

2357
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,789
character I could I could I could put it
in its own little snippet and and get no

2358
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:11,799
in its own little snippet and and get no
 

2359
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:14,789
in its own little snippet and and get no
value from it right so maybe initially I

2360
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:14,799
value from it right so maybe initially I
 

2361
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:16,630
value from it right so maybe initially I
make a recessive call like that it would

2362
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
make a recessive call like that it would
 

2363
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,190
make a recessive call like that it would
be okay to initialize it to zero and

2364
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:18,200
be okay to initialize it to zero and
 

2365
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,549
be okay to initialize it to zero and
then do this but

2366
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:19,559
then do this but
 

2367
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,950
then do this but
whatever notice we're already seeing the

2368
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:21,960
whatever notice we're already seeing the
 

2369
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,789
whatever notice we're already seeing the
T in our sort bot start to kind of stick

2370
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:23,799
T in our sort bot start to kind of stick
 

2371
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:25,150
T in our sort bot start to kind of stick
out at us we're going to only depend on

2372
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:25,160
out at us we're going to only depend on
 

2373
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,430
out at us we're going to only depend on
bigger indices I okay but in addition to

2374
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:29,440
bigger indices I okay but in addition to
 

2375
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,190
bigger indices I okay but in addition to
this this isn't enough right this would

2376
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,200
this this isn't enough right this would
 

2377
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,829
this this isn't enough right this would
obviously just recurse the end of our

2378
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:32,839
obviously just recurse the end of our
 

2379
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:35,190
obviously just recurse the end of our
list and and do nothing uh we get value

2380
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
list and and do nothing uh we get value
 

2381
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,470
list and and do nothing uh we get value
if we can find a substring that's in our

2382
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:37,480
if we can find a substring that's in our
 

2383
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,069
if we can find a substring that's in our
our our list so what we could do is um

2384
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:42,079
our our list so what we could do is um
 

2385
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,030
our our list so what we could do is um
for each

2386
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:46,040

 

2387
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,710

marker uh in P remember p is the list of

2388
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:49,720
marker uh in P remember p is the list of
 

2389
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,589
marker uh in P remember p is the list of
things that we're looking

2390
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:53,599

 

2391
00:50:53,599 --> 00:51:00,150

for okay um um what could I do uh if the

2392
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,160
for okay um um what could I do uh if the
 

2393
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,069
for okay um um what could I do uh if the

00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:19,720
marker well what could I do I could get
 

2405
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,870

00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:22,880
one dollar by by Mark you know by
 

2407
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,109
one dollar by by Mark you know by
matching that

00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:24,119
matching that
 

2409
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,470
matching that
object and then I have to hop forward

2410
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:26,480
object and then I have to hop forward
 

2411
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,109
object and then I have to hop forward
the length of the string uh in my

2412
00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:28,119
the length of the string uh in my
 

2413
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,710
the length of the string uh in my
recursive call right so

2414
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:32,720

 

2415
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,309

um well I could do that or I could not

2416
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:35,319
um well I could do that or I could not
 

2417
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:38,630
um well I could do that or I could not
do that and I want to maximize right

2418
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:38,640
do that and I want to maximize right
 

2419
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,510
do that and I want to maximize right
so I could keep my old value or um I

2420
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:42,520
so I could keep my old value or um I
 

2421
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,710
so I could keep my old value or um I
could get one point by using this as my

2422
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:46,720
could get one point by using this as my
 

2423
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,750
could get one point by using this as my
match plus x i plus um the length of the

00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:52,760
match plus x i plus um the length of the
 

2425
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,030
match plus x i plus um the length of the
marker okay and this is actually in my

2426
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,040
marker okay and this is actually in my
 

2427
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,230
marker okay and this is actually in my
mind the simplest possible Dynamic

2428
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:58,240
mind the simplest possible Dynamic
 

2429
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,470
mind the simplest possible Dynamic
program you could come up with this is

2430
00:51:59,470 --> 00:51:59,480
program you could come up with this is
 

2431
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,710
program you could come up with this is
actually a totally fine Dynamic program

2432
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:01,720
actually a totally fine Dynamic program
 

2433
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,870
actually a totally fine Dynamic program
we'll just see that the runtime isn't

2434
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880
we'll just see that the runtime isn't
 

2435
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,870
we'll just see that the runtime isn't
good

2436
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:05,880

 

2437
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,990

enough okay um so does everybody agree

2438
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:10,000
enough okay um so does everybody agree
 

2439
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,510
enough okay um so does everybody agree
this is a way I could solve this this

2440
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
this is a way I could solve this this
 

2441
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,150
this is a way I could solve this this
problem and it would give me a correct

2442
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:13,160
problem and it would give me a correct
 

2443
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:18,430
problem and it would give me a correct
uh answer um I'll do the

2444
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:18,440
uh answer um I'll do the
 

2445
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,990
uh answer um I'll do the
tabbot yeah that's what we're going to

2446
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,000
tabbot yeah that's what we're going to
 

2447
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,230
tabbot yeah that's what we're going to
do but we're we're going to maybe skip

2448
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:21,240
do but we're we're going to maybe skip
 

2449
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,069
do but we're we're going to maybe skip
some parts of sort bot um so in in

2450
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:24,079
some parts of sort bot um so in in
 

2451
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,270
some parts of sort bot um so in in
particular um what's the topological

2452
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:26,280
particular um what's the topological
 

2453
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,670
particular um what's the topological
order notice that I always look to the

2454
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:27,680
order notice that I always look to the
 

2455
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,390
order notice that I always look to the
right uh when I make a recursive call um

2456
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:31,400
right uh when I make a recursive call um
 

2457
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,870
right uh when I make a recursive call um
what's my base case well in this case

2458
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:33,880
what's my base case well in this case
 

2459
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,950
what's my base case well in this case
it's just uh X of of zero I guess

2460
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:36,960
it's just uh X of of zero I guess
 

2461
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,109
it's just uh X of of zero I guess
because I'm looking forward oh I'm sorry

2462
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:39,119
because I'm looking forward oh I'm sorry
 

2463
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,950
because I'm looking forward oh I'm sorry
my base case is X of of the whole length

2464
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:40,960
my base case is X of of the whole length
 

2465
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,789
my base case is X of of the whole length
of the string which is going to return

2466
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:42,799
of the string which is going to return
 

2467
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:45,109
of the string which is going to return
zero right because if I have no string I

2468
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:45,119
zero right because if I have no string I
 

2469
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,950
zero right because if I have no string I
can't get any value out of it the uh

2470
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:47,960
can't get any value out of it the uh
 

2471
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,670
can't get any value out of it the uh
original is X of zero meaning that I

2472
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
original is X of zero meaning that I
 

2473
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,030
original is X of zero meaning that I
want the whole string and let's actually

2474
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:52,040
want the whole string and let's actually
 

2475
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,750
want the whole string and let's actually
do the runtime analysis as as uh Jason

2476
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:54,760
do the runtime analysis as as uh Jason
 

2477
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,589
do the runtime analysis as as uh Jason
suggests because that's of course the

2478
00:52:56,589 --> 00:52:56,599
suggests because that's of course the
 

2479
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:02,470
suggests because that's of course the
relevant computation here um so this is

2480
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
relevant computation here um so this is
 

2481
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,950
relevant computation here um so this is
T2 because it's the second T in sort F

2482
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:05,960
T2 because it's the second T in sort F
 

2483
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,630
T2 because it's the second T in sort F
okay so how many sub problems are

2484
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:09,640
okay so how many sub problems are
 

2485
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,589
okay so how many sub problems are
there well there's I mean it almost

2486
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:12,599
there well there's I mean it almost
 

2487
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:13,789
there well there's I mean it almost
looks like we should have a fast

2488
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:13,799
looks like we should have a fast
 

2489
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:15,270
looks like we should have a fast
algorithm because our our sub problems

2490
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:15,280
algorithm because our our sub problems
 

2491
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,150
algorithm because our our sub problems
are only indexed by I right um so

2492
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160
are only indexed by I right um so
 

2493
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,390
are only indexed by I right um so
there's one sub problem um for basically

2494
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:21,400
there's one sub problem um for basically
 

2495
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,750
there's one sub problem um for basically
each character in the string so there's

2496
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
each character in the string so there's
 

2497
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,030
each character in the string so there's
mod S Sub problems

2498
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:28,040

 

2499
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,630

total but how much time does it take for

2500
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:31,640
total but how much time does it take for
 

2501
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,910
total but how much time does it take for
each sub problem well let's be

2502
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:33,920
each sub problem well let's be
 

2503
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,789
each sub problem well let's be
careful so there's a for Loop over all

2504
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:37,799
careful so there's a for Loop over all
 

2505
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:42,470
careful so there's a for Loop over all
the markers in P so I know that I

2506
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,480
the markers in P so I know that I
 

2507
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,990
the markers in P so I know that I
incur at least mod P work uh in my sub

2508
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:47,000
incur at least mod P work uh in my sub
 

2509
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,030
incur at least mod P work uh in my sub
problem is that all the work that I

2510
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:50,040
problem is that all the work that I
 

2511
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,829
problem is that all the work that I
incur kind of looks like it because

2512
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
incur kind of looks like it because
 

2513
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,069
incur kind of looks like it because
there's only one for Loop and there's an

2514
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:53,079
there's only one for Loop and there's an
 

2515
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:54,710
there's only one for Loop and there's an
if but how do I check if strings are

2516
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:54,720
if but how do I check if strings are
 

2517
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,589
if but how do I check if strings are
equal I have to iterate over the length

2518
00:53:56,589 --> 00:53:56,599
equal I have to iterate over the length
 

2519
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:00,390
equal I have to iterate over the length
of the string so I incur a second cost

2520
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,400
of the string so I incur a second cost
 

2521
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,750
of the string so I incur a second cost
which is checking if two strings are

2522
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:01,760
which is checking if two strings are
 

2523
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,150
which is checking if two strings are
equal we know that our strings are at

2524
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:04,160
equal we know that our strings are at
 

2525
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,950
equal we know that our strings are at
most well I didn't actually write it

2526
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:05,960
most well I didn't actually write it
 

2527
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,549
most well I didn't actually write it
down but the problem tells us that our

2528
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:07,559
down but the problem tells us that our
 

2529
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:10,270
down but the problem tells us that our
strings are at at most length

2530
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:10,280
strings are at at most length
 

2531
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,470
strings are at at most length
K so I incur another factor of K in

2532
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
K so I incur another factor of K in
 

2533
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,829
K so I incur another factor of K in
every one of my sub problems and that

2534
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:16,839
every one of my sub problems and that
 

2535
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,789
every one of my sub problems and that
implies that our whole algorithm that

2536
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:18,799
implies that our whole algorithm that
 

2537
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:21,630
implies that our whole algorithm that
I've I've outline for y'all above takes

2538
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:21,640
I've I've outline for y'all above takes
 

2539
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,069
I've I've outline for y'all above takes

2 oh I'm sorry that was a lie if I

2542
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:27,400
2 oh I'm sorry that was a lie if I
 

2543
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,109
2 oh I'm sorry that was a lie if I
actually multiply these things together

2544
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119
actually multiply these things together
 

2545
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,829
actually multiply these things together
what I get sorry this is I need more

2546
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:32,839
what I get sorry this is I need more
 

2547
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:37,270
what I get sorry this is I need more
sleep s PK and that is against the rules

2548
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,280
sleep s PK and that is against the rules
 

2549
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,150
sleep s PK and that is against the rules
that's frowny face yeah uh because in

2550
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,160
that's frowny face yeah uh because in
 

2551
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,910
that's frowny face yeah uh because in
particular I took two big numbers in

2552
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:42,920
particular I took two big numbers in
 

2553
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,030
particular I took two big numbers in
some sense and multiplied them together

2554
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,040
some sense and multiplied them together
 

2555
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,390
some sense and multiplied them together
uh and and and and that's no good so

2556
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:48,400
uh and and and and that's no good so
 

2557
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,349
uh and and and and that's no good so
what what is a person to do you know I I

2558
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:50,359
what what is a person to do you know I I
 

2559
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:52,190
what what is a person to do you know I I
tried to solve my problem I came up with

2560
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:52,200
tried to solve my problem I came up with
 

2561
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,069
tried to solve my problem I came up with
by the way for from a partial credit

2562
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,079
by the way for from a partial credit
 

2563
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,670
by the way for from a partial credit
perspective I think you'd be be doing

2564
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:55,680
perspective I think you'd be be doing
 

2565
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,910
perspective I think you'd be be doing
okay if you got to to this point okay

2566
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
okay if you got to to this point okay
 

2567
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,870
okay if you got to to this point okay
not great but okay um but of course the

2568
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:01,880
not great but okay um but of course the
 

2569
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,589
not great but okay um but of course the
problem is is is asking you uh to solve

2570
00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:04,599
problem is is is asking you uh to solve
 

2571
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:06,750
problem is is is asking you uh to solve
this in this funny uh runtime which is

2572
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:06,760
this in this funny uh runtime which is
 

2573
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:12,309
this in this funny uh runtime which is
KP plus k^2 uh uh s yep when I see a sum

2574
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,319
KP plus k^2 uh uh s yep when I see a sum
 

2575
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,349
KP plus k^2 uh uh s yep when I see a sum
like this in a you know remember that

2576
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:14,359
like this in a you know remember that
 

2577
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:15,870
like this in a you know remember that
there are two problems to solve there

2578
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:15,880
there are two problems to solve there
 

2579
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,430
there are two problems to solve there
are two strategies for solving problems

2580
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:17,440
are two strategies for solving problems
 

2581
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,349
are two strategies for solving problems
in algorith class there's one which is

2582
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:19,359
in algorith class there's one which is
 

2583
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,990
in algorith class there's one which is
useful in your everyday lives which is

2584
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:21,000
useful in your everyday lives which is
 

2585
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,309
useful in your everyday lives which is
to devise algorithms there's a second

2586
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:23,319
to devise algorithms there's a second
 

2587
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,829
to devise algorithms there's a second
which is to psychologically diagnose

2588
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:24,839
which is to psychologically diagnose
 

2589
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:27,230
which is to psychologically diagnose
your instructors um and I think that

2590
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:27,240
your instructors um and I think that
 

2591
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,430
your instructors um and I think that
second strategy is actually pretty

2592
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:28,440
second strategy is actually pretty
 

2593
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,829
second strategy is actually pretty
effective here I see two terms most of

2594
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:30,839
effective here I see two terms most of
 

2595
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:32,589
effective here I see two terms most of
our dynamic programming things involve

2596
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:32,599
our dynamic programming things involve
 

2597
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:33,829
our dynamic programming things involve
filling in a table where you would

2598
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
filling in a table where you would
 

2599
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,349
filling in a table where you would
expect there to be a product so in

2600
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:36,359
expect there to be a product so in
 

2601
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:37,910
expect there to be a product so in
general I would kind of squint at this

2602
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
general I would kind of squint at this
 

2603
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,309
general I would kind of squint at this
and Think Like H maybe I have to do some

2604
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:41,319
and Think Like H maybe I have to do some
 

2605
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:45,950
and Think Like H maybe I have to do some
pre-computation yep in particular um we

2606
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:45,960
pre-computation yep in particular um we
 

2607
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,750
pre-computation yep in particular um we
got to do a lot of string matching in

2608
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:47,760
got to do a lot of string matching in
 

2609
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,069
got to do a lot of string matching in
our problem and maybe we can make that

2610
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:51,079
our problem and maybe we can make that
 

2611
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:53,470
our problem and maybe we can make that
more efficient yeah that that's sort of

2612
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:53,480
more efficient yeah that that's sort of
 

2613
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,630
more efficient yeah that that's sort of
the the the main question here

2614
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:55,640
the the the main question here
 

2615
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,670
the the the main question here
um right so so this thing is too slow

2616
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:57,680
um right so so this thing is too slow
 

2617
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,549
um right so so this thing is too slow
and we're trying to fix it the way I'm

2618
00:55:59,549 --> 00:55:59,559
and we're trying to fix it the way I'm
 

2619
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:02,190
and we're trying to fix it the way I'm
going to try and fix it is to say like

2620
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:02,200
going to try and fix it is to say like
 

2621
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,670
going to try and fix it is to say like
okay well I have mod S Sub problems if I

2622
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:05,680
okay well I have mod S Sub problems if I
 

2623
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,150
okay well I have mod S Sub problems if I
look at these two terms how much work

2624
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:07,160
look at these two terms how much work
 

2625
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,309
look at these two terms how much work
can I actually do in my sub problem

2626
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:09,319
can I actually do in my sub problem
 

2627
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:11,870
can I actually do in my sub problem
something that looks like K squ maybe

2628
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:11,880
something that looks like K squ maybe
 

2629
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,630
something that looks like K squ maybe
plus this amount of pre-computation see

2630
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:13,640
plus this amount of pre-computation see
 

2631
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,589
plus this amount of pre-computation see
what I did there okay so let's uh let's

2632
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
what I did there okay so let's uh let's
 

2633
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,430
what I did there okay so let's uh let's
do

2634

that so in particular here are the types

2636
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:21,760
that so in particular here are the types
 

2637
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,910
that so in particular here are the types
of queries that I'm going to have to

2638
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
of queries that I'm going to have to

there's a bunch of times in my code when

2642
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:29,400
there's a bunch of times in my code when
 

2643
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,789
there's a bunch of times in my code when
uh here's a number that he falling apart

2644
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:33,799
uh here's a number that he falling apart
 

2645
00:56:33,799 --> 00:56:35,230
uh here's a number that he falling apart
that's what I get for sprinting across

2646
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:35,240
that's what I get for sprinting across
 

2647
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,910
that's what I get for sprinting across
campus to get here uh I'm going to

2648
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:36,920
campus to get here uh I'm going to
 

2649
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,270
campus to get here uh I'm going to
define a me a number m

2650
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:40,280
define a me a number m
 

2651
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,430
define a me a number m
j and it's going to be

2652
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:42,440
j and it's going to be
 

2653
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,270
j and it's going to be
one if the substring

2654
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:46,280
one if the substring

2J uh is in my list of markers p

2658
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
2J uh is in my list of markers p
 

2659
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,870
2J uh is in my list of markers p
and zero

2660

2661
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,190

otherwise by the way why is this enough

2662
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:02,200
otherwise by the way why is this enough
 

2663
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,990
otherwise by the way why is this enough
like notice that I'm not answering which

2664
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,000
like notice that I'm not answering which
 

2665
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,510
like notice that I'm not answering which
marker but the problem doesn't really

2666
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:06,520
marker but the problem doesn't really
 

2667
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,190
marker but the problem doesn't really
care right like this problem just checks

2668
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:08,200
care right like this problem just checks
 

2669
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,309
care right like this problem just checks
if there is a marker and if so then I I

2670
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:10,319
if there is a marker and if so then I I
 

2671
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,109
if there is a marker and if so then I I
use it yeah so if I have this thing

2672
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:13,119
use it yeah so if I have this thing
 

2673
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,589
use it yeah so if I have this thing
that's going to somehow make this for

2674
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:14,599
that's going to somehow make this for
 

2675
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,349
that's going to somehow make this for
Loop a heck a lot easier because now I

2676
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:16,359
Loop a heck a lot easier because now I
 

2677
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:17,870
Loop a heck a lot easier because now I
don't have to do string matching we'll

2678
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:17,880
don't have to do string matching we'll
 

2679
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,950
don't have to do string matching we'll
return to that in a

2680
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
return to that in a
 

2681
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,910
return to that in a
minute okay so my question is how can I

2682
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:23,920
minute okay so my question is how can I
 

2683
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,230
minute okay so my question is how can I
compute this thing and by the way notice

2684
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:28,240

 

2685
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,829

that I know how to compute this when the

2686
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:31,839
that I know how to compute this when the
 

2687
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,390
that I know how to compute this when the
difference between I and J is bigger

2688
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:33,400
difference between I and J is bigger
 

2689
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,069
difference between I and J is bigger
than K right because I know that all of

2690
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:36,079
than K right because I know that all of
 

2691
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,990
than K right because I know that all of
my markers have length K or less that's

2692
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:39,000
my markers have length K or less that's
 

2693
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,190
my markers have length K or less that's
going to be important because even

2694
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:40,200
going to be important because even
 

2695
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,109
going to be important because even
though m is doubly indexed uh I don't

2696
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:43,119
though m is doubly indexed uh I don't
 

2697
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,230
though m is doubly indexed uh I don't
actually need to do that in fact I could

2698
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:45,240
actually need to do that in fact I could
 

2699
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,630
actually need to do that in fact I could
even store it uh using less memory than

2700
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:47,640
even store it uh using less memory than
 

2701
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,870
even store it uh using less memory than
that if I wanted to by kind of just

2702
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:48,880
that if I wanted to by kind of just
 

2703
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,789
that if I wanted to by kind of just
storing that that diagonal block okay uh

2704
00:57:53,789 --> 00:57:53,799
storing that that diagonal block okay uh
 

2705
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:56,109
storing that that diagonal block okay uh
right so the other thing which I think

2706
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:56,119
right so the other thing which I think
 

2707
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:57,789
right so the other thing which I think
we saw in a previous uh problem session

2708
00:57:57,789 --> 00:57:57,799
we saw in a previous uh problem session
 

2709
00:57:57,799 --> 00:57:58,829
we saw in a previous uh problem session
as well is that when we do a lot of

2710
00:57:58,829 --> 00:57:58,839
as well is that when we do a lot of
 

2711
00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:01,990
as well is that when we do a lot of
string matching it often pays to put our

2712
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:02,000
string matching it often pays to put our
 

2713
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,870
string matching it often pays to put our
strings into a hash table uh so that

2714
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:03,880
strings into a hash table uh so that
 

2715
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,470
strings into a hash table uh so that
they're easier to look up later like

2716
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:05,480
they're easier to look up later like
 

2717
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,349
they're easier to look up later like
does this string exist in in this thing

2718
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:07,359
does this string exist in in this thing
 

2719
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,069
does this string exist in in this thing
or not right rather than matching every

2720
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:09,079
or not right rather than matching every
 

2721
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:11,390
or not right rather than matching every
character every single time um so maybe

2722
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:11,400
character every single time um so maybe
 

2723
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,150
character every single time um so maybe
we do that just for for for for fun uh

2724
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:15,160
we do that just for for for for fun uh
 

2725
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,390
we do that just for for for for fun uh
and in general when you see a string

2726
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,400
and in general when you see a string
 

2727
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,990
and in general when you see a string
matching problem I might and you have a

2728
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
matching problem I might and you have a
 

2729
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,270
matching problem I might and you have a
list of strings I'd suggest thinking

2730
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,280
list of strings I'd suggest thinking
 

2731
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,349
list of strings I'd suggest thinking
about hash tables just for for Fun and

2732
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
about hash tables just for for Fun and
 

2733
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,950
about hash tables just for for Fun and
Profit yeah so in in step one here maybe

2734
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:23,960
Profit yeah so in in step one here maybe
 

2735
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,430
Profit yeah so in in step one here maybe
I put

2736
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:26,440
I put
 

2737
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,630
I put
all the strings in P into a

2738
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:31,640

 

2739
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,630

hash okay um how much time does that

2740
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:34,640
hash okay um how much time does that
 

2741
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,349
hash okay um how much time does that
take well I have to process every string

2742
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:37,359
take well I have to process every string
 

2743
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,390
take well I have to process every string
right find its its code um which is

2744
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:39,400
right find its its code um which is
 

2745
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,510
right find its its code um which is
going to take order K time there's mod P

2746
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:41,520
going to take order K time there's mod P
 

2747
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,910
going to take order K time there's mod P
of them so this is K mod P

2748
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:45,920
of them so this is K mod P
 

2749
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,230
of them so this is K mod P
time notice that that conveniently

2750
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:48,240
time notice that that conveniently
 

2751
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,150
time notice that that conveniently
agrees with our first term here so we

2752
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
agrees with our first term here so we
 

2753
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,990
agrees with our first term here so we
feel like aha we're in we're in good

2754
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:52,000
feel like aha we're in we're in good
 

2755
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,990
feel like aha we're in we're in good
shape we're making progress here um and

2756
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:55,000
shape we're making progress here um and
 

2757
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,349
shape we're making progress here um and
now uh maybe I want to fill in this M J

2758
00:58:58,349 --> 00:58:58,359
now uh maybe I want to fill in this M J
 

2759
00:58:58,359 --> 00:59:03,109
now uh maybe I want to fill in this M J
uh object uh here how could I do

2760
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
uh object uh here how could I do
 

2761
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,390
uh object uh here how could I do
that well for one I'm certainly going

2762
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,400
that well for one I'm certainly going
 

2763
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,510
that well for one I'm certainly going
have to iterate over all possible eyes

2764
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:08,520
have to iterate over all possible eyes
 

2765
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,589
have to iterate over all possible eyes
yeah so let's let's uh let's do that so

2766
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:10,599
yeah so let's let's uh let's do that so
 

2767
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:12,910
yeah so let's let's uh let's do that so
we're going to do two by the way I mean

2768
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:12,920
we're going to do two by the way I mean
 

2769
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,789
we're going to do two by the way I mean
like using ones and twos and as's and

2770
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:14,799
like using ones and twos and as's and
 

2771
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,549
like using ones and twos and as's and
B's and whatever these are just ways to

2772
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559
B's and whatever these are just ways to
 

2773
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,750
B's and whatever these are just ways to
denote steps of

2774
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:18,760
denote steps of
 

2775
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,589
denote steps of
things uh okay

2776
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:22,599

 

2777
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:25,349

so let's say that I just want to fill in

2778
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:25,359
so let's say that I just want to fill in
 

2779
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,910
so let's say that I just want to fill in
M um using a brain dead algorithm so I

2780
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:27,920
M um using a brain dead algorithm so I
 

2781
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,789
M um using a brain dead algorithm so I
could go from one to the size of my

2782
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:30,799
could go from one to the size of my
 

2783
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,349
could go from one to the size of my
strings for

2784
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:32,359
strings for
 

2785
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:37,230
strings for
I careful now I can't incur an S squ but

2786
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:37,240
I careful now I can't incur an S squ but
 

2787
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,829
I careful now I can't incur an S squ but
I know that my strings are always at

2788
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:39,839
I know that my strings are always at
 

2789
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,069
I know that my strings are always at
most length K so I could do

2790
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:42,079
most length K so I could do
 

2791
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,270
most length K so I could do
for J

2792
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:44,280
for J
 

2793
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,710
for J
equals uh I + 1

2794
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
equals uh I + 1
 

2795
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,510
equals uh I + 1
2 I + K so this for Loop actually incurs

2796
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,520
2 I + K so this for Loop actually incurs
 

2797
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,670
2 I + K so this for Loop actually incurs
K time not mod s time and now uh I can

2798
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:57,680
K time not mod s time and now uh I can
 

2799
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,470
K time not mod s time and now uh I can
do two things right I can find the uh

2800
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:01,480
do two things right I can find the uh
 

2801
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,190
do two things right I can find the uh
hash of the string from I to J right

2802
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:06,200
hash of the string from I to J right
 

2803
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,789
hash of the string from I to J right
this is going to take order K

2804
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:09,799
this is going to take order K
 

2805
01:00:09,799 --> 01:00:11,309
this is going to take order K
time

2806
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:11,319

2807
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:13,069
time
and I

2808
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:13,079
and I
 

2809
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:17,870
and I
can uh search for it

2810
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:17,880

 

2811
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,990

ah

2812
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,000

2815
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,950

no uh um to see if it's actually in our

2816
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:26,960
no uh um to see if it's actually in our
 

2817
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,589
no uh um to see if it's actually in our
uh hash table of p and if it is uh then

2818
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:30,599
uh hash table of p and if it is uh then
 

2819
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:32,670
uh hash table of p and if it is uh then
I set m equal to one otherwise I set m

2820
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:32,680
I set m equal to one otherwise I set m
 

2821
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,710
I set m equal to one otherwise I set m
equal to

2822
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:35,720

 

2823
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,589

zero uh right and these are our sort of

2824
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:38,599
zero uh right and these are our sort of
 

2825
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:40,589
zero uh right and these are our sort of
constant time operations at least in

2826
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:40,599
constant time operations at least in
 

2827
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,630
constant time operations at least in
expectation so how much uh cost to it

2828
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:43,640
expectation so how much uh cost to it
 

2829
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,910
expectation so how much uh cost to it
and and so this you can convince

2830
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:44,920
and and so this you can convince
 

2831
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,390
and and so this you can convince
yourself uh fills in that array M how

2832
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:47,400
yourself uh fills in that array M how
 

2833
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,549
yourself uh fills in that array M how
much times does it take well I have a

2834
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:48,559
much times does it take well I have a
 

2835
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,870
much times does it take well I have a
loop to the size of s I have a loop of

2836
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:52,880
loop to the size of s I have a loop of
 

2837
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,109
loop to the size of s I have a loop of
size K I have a second second Loop of

2838
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,119
size K I have a second second Loop of
 

2839
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,710
size K I have a second second Loop of
size K here to compute the hash so this

2840
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:57,720
size K here to compute the hash so this
 

2841
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,430
size K here to compute the hash so this
whole thing is going to take order k^ 2

2842
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
whole thing is going to take order k^ 2
 

2843
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,069
whole thing is going to take order k^ 2
mod s time like that notice

2844
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:06,079
mod s time like that notice
 

2845
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,510
mod s time like that notice
conveniently there's chalk on the floor

2846
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:08,520
conveniently there's chalk on the floor
 

2847
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,630
conveniently there's chalk on the floor
and this is uh the second term in our

2848
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:10,640
and this is uh the second term in our
 

2849
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,750
and this is uh the second term in our
runtime so this is kosher we can fill in

2850
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:12,760
runtime so this is kosher we can fill in
 

2851
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,910
runtime so this is kosher we can fill in
m and and and and and that's a

2852
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:14,920
m and and and and and that's a
 

2853
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,029
m and and and and and that's a
convenient object to have around so the

2854
01:01:17,029 --> 01:01:17,039
convenient object to have around so the
 

2855
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:19,349
convenient object to have around so the
only thing that remains is to revise our

2856
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
only thing that remains is to revise our
 

2857
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,630
only thing that remains is to revise our
R from above um to make use of the M

2858
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:22,640
R from above um to make use of the M
 

2859
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,589
R from above um to make use of the M
that we have uh and that's pretty

2860
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
that we have uh and that's pretty
 

2861
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,390
that we have uh and that's pretty
straightforward

2862
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:29,400

 

2863
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,510

um so the trick is to not lean against

2864
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:32,520
um so the trick is to not lean against
 

2865
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,549
um so the trick is to not lean against
this thing and to actually hit the stop

2866
01:01:34,549 --> 01:01:34,559
this thing and to actually hit the stop
 

2867
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,029

button I'm I'm learning so now I suppose

2868
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:38,039
button I'm I'm learning so now I suppose
 

2869
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:40,589
button I'm I'm learning so now I suppose
we had T2 for the second

2870
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:40,599
we had T2 for the second
 

2871
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,870
we had T2 for the second
T So for our revised R we should have R

2872
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:44,880
T So for our revised R we should have R
 

2873
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,829
T So for our revised R we should have R

um what was that the Der that's that's

2876
01:01:51,029 --> 01:01:51,039
um what was that the Der that's that's
 

2877
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:52,349
um what was that the Der that's that's
right the derivative yeah we could do

2878
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:52,359
right the derivative yeah we could do
 

2879
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:54,549
right the derivative yeah we could do
you know like christopal symbols like I

2880
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:54,559
you know like christopal symbols like I

uh take 6838 if you want to learn what

2884
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:01,680
uh take 6838 if you want to learn what
 

2885
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,230
uh take 6838 if you want to learn what
christopal symbols are um right so uh

2886
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
christopal symbols are um right so uh
 

2887
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,630
christopal symbols are um right so uh
Now what is my recursive call for

2888
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:09,640
Now what is my recursive call for
 

2889
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,109
Now what is my recursive call for
XI well I want to

2890
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:14,119

 

2891
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:16,549

maximize uh well what can I do I can

2892
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:16,559
maximize uh well what can I do I can
 

2893
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,390
maximize uh well what can I do I can
check every possible length of a string

2894
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:19,400
check every possible length of a string
 

2895
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,990
check every possible length of a string
um that could be in P che check if it is

2896
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:23,000
um that could be in P che check if it is
 

2897
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,470
um that could be in P che check if it is
using my array m

2898
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:25,480
using my array m
 

2899
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,510
using my array m
um and and get that amount of profit so

2900
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:27,520
um and and get that amount of profit so
 

2901
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,309
um and and get that amount of profit so
in particular I get

2902
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:29,319
in particular I get
 

2903
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:31,470
in particular I get
M by the way I keep using the word

2904
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:31,480
M by the way I keep using the word
 

2905
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,910
M by the way I keep using the word
profit here I'm essentially using that

2906
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:32,920
profit here I'm essentially using that
 

2907
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,190
profit here I'm essentially using that
to mean increment in every single one of

01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,789
to mean increment in every single one of
our our problems here I like to think of

2910
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
our our problems here I like to think of
 

2911
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,630
our our problems here I like to think of
our problems as maximizing profit

2912
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:38,640
our problems as maximizing profit
 

2913
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,789
our problems as maximizing profit
because I'm a greedy Professor so this

2914
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:40,799
because I'm a greedy Professor so this
 

2915
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,390
because I'm a greedy Professor so this
is m i j which would be like one if I

2916
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:44,400
is m i j which would be like one if I
 

2917
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,750
is m i j which would be like one if I
found a string there and zero if I'm not

2918
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:46,760

01:02:59,710 --> 01:02:59,720
is in one to uh well
 

2927
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,910
is in one to uh well
either the length of the string or I get

2928
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:02,920
either the length of the string or I get
 

2929
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,950
either the length of the string or I get
to the end of either the maximum length

01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:12,520
array like that okay and this is our new
 

2937
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,349

recursive call the one thing we should

2938
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:14,359
recursive call the one thing we should
 

2939
01:03:14,359 --> 01:03:16,309
recursive call the one thing we should
double check is what is the runtime for

2940
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:16,319
double check is what is the runtime for
 

2941
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,510
double check is what is the runtime for
actually filling in X now well there's

2942
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:18,520
actually filling in X now well there's
 

2943
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,390
actually filling in X now well there's
still mod S Sub

2944
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:21,400
still mod S Sub
 

2945
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,829
still mod S Sub
problems and now how long does it take

2946
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:24,839
problems and now how long does it take
 

2947
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:26,910
problems and now how long does it take
well now I just have one Loop over K

2948
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:26,920
well now I just have one Loop over K
 

2949
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,150
well now I just have one Loop over K
things this is mod s * K it's actually

2950
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,160
things this is mod s * K it's actually
 

2951
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,269
things this is mod s * K it's actually
less than any of the terms that's in our

2952
01:03:32,269 --> 01:03:32,279
less than any of the terms that's in our
 

2953
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:33,470
less than any of the terms that's in our

2954
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:33,480
uh
 

2955
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,630
uh
runtime and so this is fine this

2956
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:35,640
runtime and so this is fine this
 

2957
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,789
runtime and so this is fine this
actually is kind of a funny example

2958
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:37,799
actually is kind of a funny example
 

2959
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:40,109
actually is kind of a funny example
where the dynamic programming part of

2960
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:40,119
where the dynamic programming part of

2963
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,549
our our algorithm once we've done all
this cute pre-computation is actually

2964
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:44,559
this cute pre-computation is actually
 

2965
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,269
this cute pre-computation is actually
insignificant um compared to all the

2966
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:46,279
insignificant um compared to all the
 

2967
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:48,029
insignificant um compared to all the
pre-computation that we had to do uh in

2968
01:03:48,029 --> 01:03:48,039
pre-computation that we had to do uh in
 

2969
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:50,150

our final runtime

2970
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,160

2971
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,670

sneaky all right any questions about uh

2972
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:52,680
sneaky all right any questions about uh
 

2973
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,069
sneaky all right any questions about uh
protein folding or whatever it is that

2974
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:54,079
protein folding or whatever it is that
 

2975

we just just

2976
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:55,000
we just just
 

2977
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,230
we just just
did okay so as usual I'm talking too

2978
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:58,240
did okay so as usual I'm talking too
 

2979
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,510
did okay so as usual I'm talking too
much cut one of yeah which one would you

2980
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:00,520
much cut one of yeah which one would you
 

2981
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,829
much cut one of yeah which one would you
prefer to cut I have very few

2982
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839

 

2983
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,510

preferences okay so one of the problems

2984
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:08,520
preferences okay so one of the problems
 

2985
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,950
preferences okay so one of the problems
um I would take a vote but with our

2986
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:11,960
um I would take a vote but with our
 

2987
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,630
um I would take a vote but with our
audience there's a high probability of a

2988
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:13,640
audience there's a high probability of a
 

2989
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,349
audience there's a high probability of a
split jury here um right so there's two

2990
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:17,359
split jury here um right so there's two
 

2991
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,349
split jury here um right so there's two
remaining problems in the problem

2992
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:18,359
remaining problems in the problem
 

2993
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:21,670
remaining problems in the problem
session as usual uh your

2994
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:21,680
session as usual uh your
 

2995
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,589
session as usual uh your
instructor you can leave it there this

2996
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:23,599
instructor you can leave it there this
 

2997
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,510
instructor you can leave it there this
is another problem learn about

2998
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
is another problem learn about
 

2999
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,870
is another problem learn about
um uh right as usual I've talked too

3000
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:27,880
um uh right as usual I've talked too
 

3001
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,190
um uh right as usual I've talked too
much and and and haven't gotten to the

3002
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,200
much and and and haven't gotten to the
 

3003
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,230
much and and and haven't gotten to the
end I get the impression that in 66 this

3004
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:32,240
end I get the impression that in 66 this
 

3005
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,109
end I get the impression that in 66 this
egg drop thing is a bit of a tradition

3006
01:04:34,109 --> 01:04:34,119
egg drop thing is a bit of a tradition
 

3007
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:36,309
egg drop thing is a bit of a tradition
anyway um so maybe we'll we'll cover

3008
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:36,319
anyway um so maybe we'll we'll cover
 

3009
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,510
anyway um so maybe we'll we'll cover
that problem really fast do they do that

3010
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
that problem really fast do they do that
 

3011
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,349
that problem really fast do they do that

this this egg drop thing mostly because

3018
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:45,799
this this egg drop thing mostly because
 

3019
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:46,990
this this egg drop thing mostly because
the other one I think takes a lot of

3020
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:47,000
the other one I think takes a lot of
 

3021
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,510
the other one I think takes a lot of
verbal setup the other one is

3022
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:50,520
verbal setup the other one is
 

3023
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,630
verbal setup the other one is
is I would say from a dynamic

programming perspective Maybe not super

3026
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,720
programming perspective Maybe not super
 

3027
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,670
programming perspective Maybe not super
exciting but from like a interesting

3028
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:56,680
exciting but from like a interesting
 

3029
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,710
exciting but from like a interesting
problem perspective is is is is kind of

3030
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:58,720
problem perspective is is is is kind of
 

3031
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,750
problem perspective is is is is kind of
cool uh to think about um so I'd

3032
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:00,760
cool uh to think about um so I'd
 

3033
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,349
cool uh to think about um so I'd
encourage you to leave it in there and

3034
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:02,359
encourage you to leave it in there and
 

3035
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:04,870
encourage you to leave it in there and
you guys can can read it at home um from

3036
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:04,880
you guys can can read it at home um from
 

3037
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,470
you guys can can read it at home um from
a coding perspective it's also kind of

3038
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
a coding perspective it's also kind of
 

3039
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,269
a coding perspective it's also kind of
fun I noticed the solution didn't do

3040
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:08,279
fun I noticed the solution didn't do
 

3041
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,549
fun I noticed the solution didn't do
what I would do which would be to use

3042
01:05:09,549 --> 01:05:09,559
what I would do which would be to use
 

3043
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:12,150
what I would do which would be to use
the the bits in the you know like assume

3044
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
the the bits in the you know like assume
 

3045
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,630
the the bits in the you know like assume
that something wasn't too tall and use

3046
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:13,640
that something wasn't too tall and use
 

3047
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,269
that something wasn't too tall and use
the bits in like an integer to store

01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:15,279
the bits in like an integer to store
 

3049
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:17,109
the bits in like an integer to store

that's sort of like you know this this

3054
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:20,880
that's sort of like you know this this
 

3055
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,510
that's sort of like you know this this
old hack for computing the square root

uh let's do a lazy egg drop instead so
that's problem

building has eggs or the residence but
uh in any event I have some set of eggs

3086
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:00,599
uh in any event I have some set of eggs
 

3087
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:02,430
uh in any event I have some set of eggs
uh and maybe I'm in the state of Center

3088
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:02,440
uh and maybe I'm in the state of Center
 

3089
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,349
uh and maybe I'm in the state of Center
or some other weird building so I don't

have Heights of floors that are

3092
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:07,599
have Heights of floors that are
 

3093
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,309
have Heights of floors that are
isotropic but rather each floor has a

3094
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
isotropic but rather each floor has a
 

3095
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:13,990
isotropic but rather each floor has a
different height which could vary

3096
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:14,000
different height which could vary
 

3097
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,990
different height which could vary
um so it's height of

3098
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:18,000

 

3099
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,750

01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:24,520
um but I digress
 

3103
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,150
um but I digress
uh and we're going to assume that that

3104
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,160
uh and we're going to assume that that
 

3105
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,750
uh and we're going to assume that that
our our list is already

3106
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
our our list is already
 

3107
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,829
our our list is already
sorted so in other words like the fifth

3108
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:29,839
sorted so in other words like the fifth
 

3109
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,950
sorted so in other words like the fifth
floor is taller than the fourth floor uh

3110
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:31,960
floor is taller than the fourth floor uh
 

3111
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,789
floor is taller than the fourth floor uh
and we don't have to like spend nlog end

3112
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:33,799
and we don't have to like spend nlog end
 

3113
01:06:33,799 --> 01:06:39,670
and we don't have to like spend nlog end
time uh doing that okay uh right

3114
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:39,680
time uh doing that okay uh right
 

3115
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,510
time uh doing that okay uh right
so apparently in our our problem we have

3116
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:42,520
so apparently in our our problem we have
 

3117
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,390
so apparently in our our problem we have
an egg with a mysterious mechanical

3118
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
an egg with a mysterious mechanical
 

3119
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,870
an egg with a mysterious mechanical
property that we are trying to

3120
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:46,880
property that we are trying to
 

3121
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,309
property that we are trying to
recover and all eggs as we know are

3122
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:49,319
recover and all eggs as we know are
 

3123
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:52,510
recover and all eggs as we know are
identical so you know the only

3124
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:52,520
identical so you know the only
 

3125
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,109
identical so you know the only
difference between eggs is like chicken

3126
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:54,119
difference between eggs is like chicken
 

3127
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:56,789
difference between eggs is like chicken

think of a third category of poultry

3130
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:58,880
think of a third category of poultry
 

3131
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,390
think of a third category of poultry
turkey thank you um right but assuming

3132
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:02,400
turkey thank you um right but assuming
 

3133
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,029
turkey thank you um right but assuming
that I got all of my eggs at the same

3134
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:04,039
that I got all of my eggs at the same
 

3135
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:05,430
that I got all of my eggs at the same
Stop and Shop and they all come from the

01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
Stop and Shop and they all come from the
 

3137
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,269
Stop and Shop and they all come from the
same species then they have roughly the

3138
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:07,279
same species then they have roughly the
 

3139
01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:09,510
same species then they have roughly the
same mechanical properties actually the

01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:09,520
same mechanical properties actually the
 

3141
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,829
same mechanical properties actually the
probably the better setup is that floors

3142
01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:10,839
probably the better setup is that floors
 

3143
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:12,309
probably the better setup is that floors
are very far apart relative to the size

3144
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:12,319
are very far apart relative to the size
 

3145
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:17,230
are very far apart relative to the size
of an egg um and if I get high enough my

breaks didn't break but it could have
 

3153
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,230
breaks didn't break but it could have
broken uh and of course if I drop it

3154
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:26,240
broken uh and of course if I drop it
 

3155
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,950
broken uh and of course if I drop it
from an even higher height my egg still

3156
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:29,960
from an even higher height my egg still
 

3157
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,870
from an even higher height my egg still
get going to break however if I have a

01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:31,880
get going to break however if I have a
 

3159
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,430
get going to break however if I have a
very low floor apparently a very low

you know when I drop my egg it actually

3164
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:38,839
you know when I drop my egg it actually
 

3165
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:42,230
you know when I drop my egg it actually
stays intact uh and and the question um

3166
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:42,240
stays intact uh and and the question um
 

3167
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,950
stays intact uh and and the question um
as all good scientists want to know is

as all good scientists want to know is
 

3169
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,069
as all good scientists want to know is
what is the highest floor in my building

3170
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
what is the highest floor in my building
 

3171
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,470
what is the highest floor in my building
from which I can drop an egg and uh have

3172
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:49,480
from which I can drop an egg and uh have
 

3173
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,670
from which I can drop an egg and uh have
it remain

3174
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:50,680
it remain
 

3175
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,510
it remain
intact

intact
and the question

3178
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:54,520
and the question
 

3179
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,630
and the question
isn't is kind of a funny one it's sort

3180
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,640
isn't is kind of a funny one it's sort
 

3181
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,150
isn't is kind of a funny one it's sort
of like experimental design in some

01:07:59,150 --> 01:07:59,160
of like experimental design in some
 

3183
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,950
of like experimental design in some
sense it's it's not asking like what is

01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:00,960
sense it's it's not asking like what is

01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,510
sense it's it's not asking like what is
the you know like given this and like a

3186
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:03,520
the you know like given this and like a
 

3187
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,230
the you know like given this and like a
list of experiments you know try and

3188
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:05,240
list of experiments you know try and
 

3189
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,510
list of experiments you know try and
figure infer something about the eggs

3190
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:07,520
figure infer something about the eggs
 

3191
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,230
figure infer something about the eggs
but rather it's saying sort of if I

3192
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:10,240
but rather it's saying sort of if I
 

3193
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,710
but rather it's saying sort of if I
carefully design a sequence of floors to

3194
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:13,720
carefully design a sequence of floors to
 

3195
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:18,030
carefully design a sequence of floors to
drop my eggs from from which upon I drop

3196
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:18,040
drop my eggs from from which upon I drop
 

3197
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:22,470
drop my eggs from from which upon I drop
my eggs then um you know in sort of what

3198
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:22,480
my eggs then um you know in sort of what
 

3199
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,669
my eggs then um you know in sort of what
is the maximum number of experiments I

3200
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:24,679
is the maximum number of experiments I
 

3201
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:27,269
is the maximum number of experiments I
need to do to triangulate in on that

3202
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
need to do to triangulate in on that
 

3203
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,910
need to do to triangulate in on that
that floor that critical floor above

3204
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
that floor that critical floor above
 

3205
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,149
that floor that critical floor above
which my eggs break yep um so what I'm

3206
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:33,159
which my eggs break yep um so what I'm
 

3207
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:34,910
which my eggs break yep um so what I'm
given are the heights of the floors and

3208
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:34,920
given are the heights of the floors and
 

3209
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,870
given are the heights of the floors and
a budget of eggs in some sense the

3210
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
a budget of eggs in some sense the
 

3211
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,229
a budget of eggs in some sense the
budget of

3212
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:38,239
budget of
 

3213
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,630
budget of
eggs sort of doesn't matter more than

3214
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
eggs sort of doesn't matter more than
 

3215
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,870
eggs sort of doesn't matter more than
just like putting a cap on the size of

3216
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:42,880
just like putting a cap on the size of
 

3217
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,789
just like putting a cap on the size of
our our problem in some sense what

3218
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:44,799
our our problem in some sense what
 

3219
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,269
our our problem in some sense what
really matters is I'd like to use fewer

3220
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:46,279
really matters is I'd like to use fewer
 

3221
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:48,789
really matters is I'd like to use fewer
than K eggs to determine that because of

3222
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:48,799
than K eggs to determine that because of
 

3223
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:49,870
than K eggs to determine that because of
course the remaining ones I'm going to

3224
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:49,880
course the remaining ones I'm going to
 

3225
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,590
course the remaining ones I'm going to
use to make an

3226
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:51,600
use to make an
 

3227
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,349
use to make an
omelet but notice the I can be a little

3228
01:08:54,349 --> 01:08:54,359
omelet but notice the I can be a little
 

3229
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:57,470
omelet but notice the I can be a little
sneaky in my experimental

3230
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:57,480
sneaky in my experimental
 

3231
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,470
sneaky in my experimental
design that

3232
01:08:59,470 --> 01:08:59,480
design that
 

3233
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,870
design that
like what happens if I drop my egg from

3234
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:01,880
like what happens if I drop my egg from
 

3235
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,709
like what happens if I drop my egg from
a really low floor in my

3236
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:03,719
a really low floor in my
 

3237
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:07,990
a really low floor in my
building well it remains intact so I can

3238
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,000
building well it remains intact so I can
 

3239
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,829
building well it remains intact so I can
slep down the stairs I can pick up my

3240
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:09,839
slep down the stairs I can pick up my
 

3241
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,309
slep down the stairs I can pick up my
egg and I can use it for my next

3242
01:09:11,309 --> 01:09:11,319
egg and I can use it for my next
 

3243
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:14,669
egg and I can use it for my next
experiment and I have not paid an

3244
01:09:14,669 --> 01:09:14,679
experiment and I have not paid an
 

3245
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:18,789
experiment and I have not paid an
egg yeah um so the first question you

3246
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:18,799
egg yeah um so the first question you
 

3247
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,510
egg yeah um so the first question you
might ask is like well why the heck

3248
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:20,520
might ask is like well why the heck
 

3249
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,789
might ask is like well why the heck
wouldn't I just start on the first floor

3250
01:09:23,789 --> 01:09:23,799
wouldn't I just start on the first floor
 

3251
01:09:23,799 --> 01:09:25,349
wouldn't I just start on the first floor
drop the egg if it's not

3252
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359
drop the egg if it's not
 

3253
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,590
drop the egg if it's not
broken you know go on to the next one

3254
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600
broken you know go on to the next one
 

3255
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,030
broken you know go on to the next one
and then drop the egg and so on that

3256
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:29,040
and then drop the egg and so on that
 

3257
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,030
and then drop the egg and so on that
would be the most egg efficient plan and

3258
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:32,040
would be the most egg efficient plan and
 

3259
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,749
would be the most egg efficient plan and
indeed that is the case because you'll

3260
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:33,759
indeed that is the case because you'll
 

3261
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,229
indeed that is the case because you'll
only break at most one egg but you're

3262
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:37,239
only break at most one egg but you're
 

3263
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,630
only break at most one egg but you're
spping up and down the stairs a bunch of

3264
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:38,640
spping up and down the stairs a bunch of
 

3265
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,070
spping up and down the stairs a bunch of
times when you solve that right like

3266
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
times when you solve that right like
 

3267
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,229
times when you solve that right like
every single time you got to go retrieve

3268
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
every single time you got to go retrieve
 

3269
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:45,269
every single time you got to go retrieve
the The Unbroken egg you got to run down

3270
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:45,279
the The Unbroken egg you got to run down
 

3271
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,630
the The Unbroken egg you got to run down
the stairs pick the thing up and then

3272
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:46,640
the stairs pick the thing up and then
 

3273
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,990
the stairs pick the thing up and then
run up to the next floor and maybe uh in

3274
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:49,000
run up to the next floor and maybe uh in
 

3275
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,070
run up to the next floor and maybe uh in
your optimization problem rather than

3276
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:51,080
your optimization problem rather than
 

3277
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,470
your optimization problem rather than
trying to like minimize the number of

3278
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,480
trying to like minimize the number of
 

3279
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,390
trying to like minimize the number of
eggs that you break you're trying to

3280
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:54,400
eggs that you break you're trying to
 

3281
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,910
eggs that you break you're trying to
minimize you know the expense on your

3282
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:56,920
minimize you know the expense on your
 

3283
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,430
minimize you know the expense on your
your your quads and and and so instead

3284
01:09:59,430 --> 01:09:59,440
your your quads and and and so instead
 

3285
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,070
your your quads and and and so instead
you're trying you know you you skipped

3286
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:01,080
you're trying you know you you skipped
 

3287
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,590
you're trying you know you you skipped
your leg day or whatever and the thing

3288
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
your leg day or whatever and the thing
 

3289
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,630
your leg day or whatever and the thing
that you're trying to

3290
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:04,640
that you're trying to
 

3291
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,709
that you're trying to
minimize is the sum over the

3292
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:10,719

 

3293
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,390

heights of the drops in your experiments

3294
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:14,400
heights of the drops in your experiments
 

3295
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,750
heights of the drops in your experiments
right so you're trying to determine the

3296
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:16,760
right so you're trying to determine the
 

3297
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,709
right so you're trying to determine the
um mechanical property of your egg uh by

3298
01:10:19,709 --> 01:10:19,719
um mechanical property of your egg uh by
 

3299
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:21,470
um mechanical property of your egg uh by
designing an experiment like like sort

3300
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:21,480
designing an experiment like like sort
 

3301
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,070
designing an experiment like like sort
of a procedure that minimizes number of

3302
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:24,080
of a procedure that minimizes number of
 

3303
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,390
of a procedure that minimizes number of
times that you need to to drop uh eggs

3304
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
times that you need to to drop uh eggs
 

3305
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,950
times that you need to to drop uh eggs
because every time you do you got to run

3306
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:27,960
because every time you do you got to run
 

3307
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,229
because every time you do you got to run
all the way back down the stairs and go

3308
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:29,239
all the way back down the stairs and go
 

3309
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:30,430
all the way back down the stairs and go
look at the pavement and see if the egg

3310
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:30,440
look at the pavement and see if the egg
 

3311
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,470
look at the pavement and see if the egg
broke or not that's a lot of work okay

3312
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:33,480
broke or not that's a lot of work okay
 

3313
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,709
broke or not that's a lot of work okay
uh this is different from the sort of

3314
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:34,719
uh this is different from the sort of
 

3315
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,110
uh this is different from the sort of
classic egg drop 66 problem which I

3316
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
classic egg drop 66 problem which I
 

3317
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,030
classic egg drop 66 problem which I
encourage you guys to go uh seek out in

3318
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,040
encourage you guys to go uh seek out in
 

3319
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,070
encourage you guys to go uh seek out in
previous uh iterations of this

3320
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:41,080
previous uh iterations of this
 

3321
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:45,030
previous uh iterations of this
course uh let me see so so right and and

3322
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
course uh let me see so so right and and
 

3323
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,590
course uh let me see so so right and and
so the the question is what is the

3324
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:46,600
so the the question is what is the
 

3325
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,070
so the the question is what is the
minimum the minimum number of egg drops

3326
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,080
minimum the minimum number of egg drops
 

3327
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,870
minimum the minimum number of egg drops
you need to do to ascertain that for any

3328
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:52,880
you need to do to ascertain that for any
 

3329
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,390
you need to do to ascertain that for any
type of egg

3330
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:54,400
type of egg
 

3331
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,189
type of egg
yeah so I give you a mystery back basket

3332
01:10:56,189 --> 01:10:56,199
yeah so I give you a mystery back basket
 

3333
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:57,470
yeah so I give you a mystery back basket
of eggs and you have to design an

3334
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:57,480
of eggs and you have to design an
 

3335
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,110
of eggs and you have to design an
experimental procedure uh and bound the

3336
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:00,120
experimental procedure uh and bound the
 

3337
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,430
experimental procedure uh and bound the
number of of of this this particular

3338
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:02,440
number of of of this this particular
 

3339
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,110
number of of of this this particular
value here given a budget of of

3340
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:05,120
value here given a budget of of
 

3341
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,270
value here given a budget of of
kxs okay uh and um the amount of time

3342
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:10,280
kxs okay uh and um the amount of time
 

3343
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,990
kxs okay uh and um the amount of time
that we have to do that is order n cubed

3344
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:15,000
that we have to do that is order n cubed
 

3345
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,149
that we have to do that is order n cubed
K apparently our building we have lots

3346
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:18,159
K apparently our building we have lots
 

3347
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:19,910
K apparently our building we have lots
of eggs and not very many

3348
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:19,920
of eggs and not very many
 

3349
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,990
of eggs and not very many
floors okay because our our setup uh

3350
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:23,000
floors okay because our our setup uh
 

3351
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,430
floors okay because our our setup uh
make some sense here we're just trying

3352
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:24,440
make some sense here we're just trying
 

3353
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,950
make some sense here we're just trying
to avoid running up and down the stairs

3354
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:25,960
to avoid running up and down the stairs
 

3355
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,990
to avoid running up and down the stairs
that's the M the main takeaway

3356
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:29,000
that's the M the main takeaway
 

3357
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,990
that's the M the main takeaway
okay so uh what are we going to do sort

3358
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,000
okay so uh what are we going to do sort
 

3359
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,590
okay so uh what are we going to do sort
bot because that's all we know how to do

3360
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:33,600
bot because that's all we know how to do
 

3361
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,910
bot because that's all we know how to do
yeah um and and in particular we're

3362
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:35,920
yeah um and and in particular we're
 

3363
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,590
yeah um and and in particular we're
going to make one observation which is

3364
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
going to make one observation which is
 

3365
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,790
going to make one observation which is
kind of Handy if I drop a floor o if I

3366
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:41,800
kind of Handy if I drop a floor o if I
 

3367
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,629
kind of Handy if I drop a floor o if I
drop an egg from a

3368
01:11:44,629 --> 01:11:44,639
drop an egg from a
 

3369
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,990
drop an egg from a
floor you know in this deterministic

3370
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:47,000
floor you know in this deterministic
 

3371
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,790
floor you know in this deterministic
universe where egg mechanics are very

3372
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:49,800
universe where egg mechanics are very
 

3373
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,350
universe where egg mechanics are very
predictable um there's only one of two

3374
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:52,360
predictable um there's only one of two
 

3375
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,550
predictable um there's only one of two
things that can happen either egg broke

3376
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:53,560
things that can happen either egg broke
 

3377
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,189
things that can happen either egg broke
broke or

3378
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:55,199
broke or
 

3379
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:59,790
broke or
didn't or I run into the board again um

3380
01:11:59,790 --> 01:11:59,800
didn't or I run into the board again um
 

3381
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,070
didn't or I run into the board again um
so let's think about our experiment

3382
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
so let's think about our experiment
 

3383
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:02,990
so let's think about our experiment
remember at the end of the day we're

3384
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:03,000
remember at the end of the day we're
 

3385
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,430
remember at the end of the day we're
trying to figure out the tallest floor

3386
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,440
trying to figure out the tallest floor
 

3387
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,550
trying to figure out the tallest floor
in my building that I can safely from

3388
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:07,560
in my building that I can safely from
 

3389
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,870
in my building that I can safely from
which I can safely drop an

3390
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:09,880
which I can safely drop an
 

3391
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,950
which I can safely drop an
egg so if I think about kind of

3392
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:11,960
egg so if I think about kind of
 

3393
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,590
egg so if I think about kind of
bracketing that height of that floor

3394
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:14,600
bracketing that height of that floor
 

3395
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,110
bracketing that height of that floor
notice that I can

3396
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:16,120
notice that I can
 

3397
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,270
notice that I can
always for one thing do I ever need a

3398
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:18,280
always for one thing do I ever need a
 

3399
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,110
always for one thing do I ever need a
bracket that's like not a continuous or

3400
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,120
bracket that's like not a continuous or
 

3401
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,709
bracket that's like not a continuous or
like a connected set of numbers the is

3402
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:23,719
like a connected set of numbers the is
 

3403
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:24,950
like a connected set of numbers the is
no right it's never it should never be

3404
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
no right it's never it should never be
 

3405
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,149
no right it's never it should never be
the casee that like I think that my eggs

3406
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,159
the casee that like I think that my eggs
 

3407
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,709
the casee that like I think that my eggs
could be on Floors one you know like

3408
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:29,719
could be on Floors one you know like
 

3409
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:30,990
could be on Floors one you know like
only the prime numbered floors in my

3410
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:31,000
only the prime numbered floors in my
 

3411
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,590
only the prime numbered floors in my
building or something that really makes

3412
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:32,600
building or something that really makes
 

3413
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,709
building or something that really makes
no sense right because if I convince

3414
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:34,719
no sense right because if I convince
 

3415
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,030
no sense right because if I convince
myself my egg breaks at floor five then

3416
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:37,040
myself my egg breaks at floor five then
 

3417
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,870
myself my egg breaks at floor five then
obviously floor 6 through n my egg also

3418
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:39,880
obviously floor 6 through n my egg also
 

3419
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,510
obviously floor 6 through n my egg also
breaks in so I always can kind of just

3420
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
breaks in so I always can kind of just
 

3421
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,750
breaks in so I always can kind of just
keep narrowing down some

3422
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:43,760
keep narrowing down some
 

3423
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,830
keep narrowing down some
interval right uh so in particular

3424
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:46,840
interval right uh so in particular
 

3425
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:50,430
interval right uh so in particular
here's kind of a clever s in my sort bot

3426
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:50,440
here's kind of a clever s in my sort bot
 

3427
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,430
here's kind of a clever s in my sort bot
which is to

3428
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:52,440
which is to
 

3429
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:58,070
which is to
say that I'm going to say that x i j

3430
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,080
say that I'm going to say that x i j
 

3431
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,430
say that I'm going to say that x i j
e is equal

3432
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:00,440
e is equal
 

3433
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,030
e is equal
to the

01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,990
to the
minimum by the way this is I'm writing

3436
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:05,000
minimum by the way this is I'm writing
 

3437
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,870
minimum by the way this is I'm writing
this as minimum total height so this is

3438
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:07,880
this as minimum total height so this is
 

3439
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,189
this as minimum total height so this is
like the minimum total times I got to

3440
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:09,199
like the minimum total times I got to
 

3441
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,790
like the minimum total times I got to
run down the stairs and check my EGS um

3442
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:11,800
run down the stairs and check my EGS um
 

3443
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,390
run down the stairs and check my EGS um
or total height that I run down the

01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:26,229
uh assuming my stairs are one foot tall
um where I have e eggs

3450
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:26,239

 

3451
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,350

left notice the way that we've written

01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:29,600
the problem this time I might as well
 

3455
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,669
the problem this time I might as well
use all of my K eggs like that doesn't

3456
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
use all of my K eggs like that doesn't
 

3457
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,430
use all of my K eggs like that doesn't
cost me anything what cost me is running

3458
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:33,440
cost me anything what cost me is running
 

3459
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,750
cost me anything what cost me is running
up and down the stairs um

01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:41,510
up and down the stairs um
and uh that I have floors I through J

3462
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
and uh that I have floors I through J
 

3463
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,550

01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,709
inclusive uh to
check so in other words if I'm on a

3466
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:45,719
check so in other words if I'm on a
 

3467
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:47,669
check so in other words if I'm on a
floor below floor I I've convinced

3468
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
floor below floor I I've convinced
 

3469
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,669
floor below floor I I've convinced
myself my egg won't break then if I'm

3470
01:13:49,669 --> 01:13:49,679
myself my egg won't break then if I'm
 

3471
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,590
myself my egg won't break then if I'm
going to floor above floor J I'm

3472
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:51,600
going to floor above floor J I'm
 

3473
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,270
going to floor above floor J I'm
convinced my egg will break

3474
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:54,280
convinced my egg will break
 

3475
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:58,030
convinced my egg will break
okay so what do I do well remember that

3476
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:58,040
okay so what do I do well remember that
 

3477
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,510
okay so what do I do well remember that
this is sort of an experimental design

3478
01:13:59,510 --> 01:13:59,520
this is sort of an experimental design
 

3479
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:07,669
this is sort of an experimental design
problem I can drop my egg from any

3480
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679

 

3481
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:15,189

floor um f which is in the range I to J

3482
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:15,199
floor um f which is in the range I to J
 

3483
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,830
floor um f which is in the range I to J
right and of course there's never a

3484
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:16,840
right and of course there's never a
 

3485
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,750
right and of course there's never a
reason for me to drop an egg from a

3486
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:18,760
reason for me to drop an egg from a
 

3487
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,629
reason for me to drop an egg from a
floor below I or above J because we

3488
01:14:20,629 --> 01:14:20,639
floor below I or above J because we
 

3489
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:22,990
floor below I or above J because we
already know what happens in that case

3490
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:23,000
already know what happens in that case
 

3491
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,790
already know what happens in that case
okay

3492
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:25,800

 

3493
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,510

so what happens uh when we do that well

3494
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
so what happens uh when we do that well
 

3495
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,510
so what happens uh when we do that well
if I drop it from floor F I have to pay

3496
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,520
if I drop it from floor F I have to pay
 

3497
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,950
if I drop it from floor F I have to pay
uh in terms of my cost function right

3498
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:34,960
uh in terms of my cost function right
 

3499
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,790
uh in terms of my cost function right
because I have to pay the height of F I

3500
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:36,800
because I have to pay the height of F I
 

3501
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,470
because I have to pay the height of F I
got to run down the the the

3502
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:38,480
got to run down the the the
 

3503
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:44,310
got to run down the the the
stairs okay um but in exchange for that

3504
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:44,320
stairs okay um but in exchange for that
 

3505
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,350
stairs okay um but in exchange for that
I learned a little bit about my egg

3506
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:46,360
I learned a little bit about my egg
 

3507
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,149
I learned a little bit about my egg
problem right I either get an upper or a

3508
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:48,159
problem right I either get an upper or a
 

3509
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,629
problem right I either get an upper or a
lower bound of f depending whether the

3510
01:14:49,629 --> 01:14:49,639
lower bound of f depending whether the
 

3511
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:52,550
lower bound of f depending whether the
egg broke okay so let's uh let's let's

3512
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:52,560
egg broke okay so let's uh let's let's
 

3513
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,390
egg broke okay so let's uh let's let's
let's let's form that mathematically so

3514
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:55,400
let's let's form that mathematically so
 

3515
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:01,830
let's let's form that mathematically so
in particular we have x i j

3516
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840

 

3517
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,550

e well what do I get to control in my

3518
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:05,560
e well what do I get to control in my
 

3519
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,310
e well what do I get to control in my
life and what do I have have to deal

3520
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,320
life and what do I have have to deal
 

3521
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,669
life and what do I have have to deal
with what I have to deal with is the

3522
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:09,679
with what I have to deal with is the
 

3523
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:10,590
with what I have to deal with is the
fact I don't know what's going to happen

3524
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:10,600
fact I don't know what's going to happen
 

3525
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,709
fact I don't know what's going to happen
to the egg it might break it might not

3526
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:12,719
to the egg it might break it might not
 

3527
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:13,950
to the egg it might break it might not
right and the Egg might be an

3528
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:13,960
right and the Egg might be an
 

3529
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,790
right and the Egg might be an
adversarial egg like it wants you to run

3530
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:15,800
adversarial egg like it wants you to run
 

3531
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,709
adversarial egg like it wants you to run
up and down the stairs and I have to

3532
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:17,719
up and down the stairs and I have to
 

3533
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:21,229
up and down the stairs and I have to
account for that but uh I am the eggs

3534
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:21,239
account for that but uh I am the eggs
 

3535
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:23,430
account for that but uh I am the eggs
adversary and get to choose what floor I

3536
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:23,440
adversary and get to choose what floor I
 

3537
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,870
adversary and get to choose what floor I
drop it from so remember like uh we saw

3538
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
drop it from so remember like uh we saw
 

3539
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,550
drop it from so remember like uh we saw
an example I forget what from class

3540
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:28,560
an example I forget what from class
 

3541
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,149
an example I forget what from class
where there was sort of a game right one

3542
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:30,159
where there was sort of a game right one
 

3543
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,310

01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,470
trying to
maximize in some sense the egg is trying

maximize in some sense the egg is trying
 

3549
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,070
maximize in some sense the egg is trying
to maximize the amount of work you have

3550
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:38,080
to maximize the amount of work you have
 

3551
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,629
to maximize the amount of work you have
to do running up and down the stairs uh

3552
01:15:40,629 --> 01:15:40,639
to do running up and down the stairs uh
 

3553
01:15:40,639 --> 01:15:42,870
to do running up and down the stairs uh
uh to do your experiment a better way to

3554
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:42,880
uh to do your experiment a better way to
 

3555
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,030
uh to do your experiment a better way to
put it is that we're trying to Upper

3556
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:44,040
put it is that we're trying to Upper
 

3557
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,870
put it is that we're trying to Upper
bound uh the amount of work in your

3558
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:45,880
bound uh the amount of work in your
 

3559
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,910
bound uh the amount of work in your
experimental

3560
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:46,920
experimental
 

3561
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,070
experimental
procedure and I'm trying to design a

3562
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:49,080
procedure and I'm trying to design a
 

3563
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,950
procedure and I'm trying to design a
procedure that minimizes my work right

3564
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:50,960
procedure that minimizes my work right
 

3565
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,510
procedure that minimizes my work right
so let's say that I'm the player so I

3566
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:52,520
so let's say that I'm the player so I
 

3567
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,030
so let's say that I'm the player so I
want to minimize

3568
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:55,040
want to minimize
 

3569
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:55,990
want to minimize
um

3570
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,000
um
 

3571
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,590
um
and the decision that I get to make the

3572
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:58,600
and the decision that I get to make the
 

3573
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,590
and the decision that I get to make the
control that I have is what well it's

3574
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:02,600
control that I have is what well it's
 

3575
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,030
control that I have is what well it's
what floor I choose right so let's say I

3576
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,040
what floor I choose right so let's say I
 

3577
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,229
what floor I choose right so let's say I
choose floor F Well I have to go down

3578
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:07,239
choose floor F Well I have to go down
 

3579
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:08,750
choose floor F Well I have to go down
the stairs so that takes me

3580
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:08,760
the stairs so that takes me
 

3581
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,110
the stairs so that takes me
HF I suppose going up the stairs is

3582
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:11,120
HF I suppose going up the stairs is
 

3583
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,790
HF I suppose going up the stairs is
probably what incurs the HF and going

3584
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:12,800
probably what incurs the HF and going
 

3585
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,709
probably what incurs the HF and going
down is nothing um but I digress but now

3586
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:16,719
down is nothing um but I digress but now
 

3587
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,950
down is nothing um but I digress but now
my I still am not done I've narrowed

3588
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:19,960
my I still am not done I've narrowed
 

3589
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,070
my I still am not done I've narrowed
down into one of two cases right either

3590
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,080
down into one of two cases right either
 

3591
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,669
down into one of two cases right either
f is my new lower bound my new upper

3592
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:23,679
f is my new lower bound my new upper
 

3593
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,070
f is my new lower bound my new upper
bound and I have to account for both of

3594
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:26,080
bound and I have to account for both of
 

3595
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,030
bound and I have to account for both of
those in my recursion and I have to take

3596
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:28,040
those in my recursion and I have to take
 

3597
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,510
those in my recursion and I have to take
the max of those two in the sense that I

3598
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:30,520
the max of those two in the sense that I
 

3599
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,070
the max of those two in the sense that I
need an every possible case that my AEG

3600
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
need an every possible case that my AEG
 

3601
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,470
need an every possible case that my AEG
drop experiment Narrows down my floor uh

3602
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:36,480
drop experiment Narrows down my floor uh
 

3603
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,070
drop experiment Narrows down my floor uh
to to to a width of of zero y so in

3604
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
to to to a width of of zero y so in
 

3605
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,110
to to to a width of of zero y so in
particular this's actually a this is a

3606
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:42,120
particular this's actually a this is a
 

3607
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,870
particular this's actually a this is a
Minimax problem there's a Max inside of

3608
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:43,880
Minimax problem there's a Max inside of
 

3609
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,470
Minimax problem there's a Max inside of
a Min here um so what's either the egg

3610
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
a Min here um so what's either the egg
 

3611
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,830
a Min here um so what's either the egg
broke in my experiment or it didn't

3612
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:50,840
broke in my experiment or it didn't
 

3613
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,669
broke in my experiment or it didn't
right so if it did broke

3614
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:53,679
right so if it did broke
 

3615
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,470
right so if it did broke
then well what happened well let's see

3616
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:56,480
then well what happened well let's see
 

3617
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,669
then well what happened well let's see
here um if the egg broke then I got an

3618
01:16:59,669 --> 01:16:59,679
here um if the egg broke then I got an
 

3619
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,910
here um if the egg broke then I got an
upper Bound for my floor so my lower

3620
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:01,920
upper Bound for my floor so my lower
 

3621
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,229
upper Bound for my floor so my lower
bound Remains the Same it's I my upper

3622
01:17:05,229 --> 01:17:05,239
bound Remains the Same it's I my upper
 

3623
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:07,669
bound Remains the Same it's I my upper
bound it's F minus one because it broke

3624
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:07,679
bound it's F minus one because it broke
 

3625
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,750
bound it's F minus one because it broke
on floor F well what happens to egg eggs

3626
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:11,760
on floor F well what happens to egg eggs
 

3627
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,590
on floor F well what happens to egg eggs
when they break I can't drop them from

3628
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:13,600
when they break I can't drop them from
 

3629
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,470
when they break I can't drop them from
floors again so I lost an

3630
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,480
floors again so I lost an
 

3631
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,149
floors again so I lost an
egg

3632
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
egg
 

3633
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:24,750
egg
okay so this is uh my egg brow

3634
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:24,760
okay so this is uh my egg brow
 

3635
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:29,149
okay so this is uh my egg brow
okay or my egg didn't break so in that

3636
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:29,159
okay or my egg didn't break so in that
 

3637
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:31,669
okay or my egg didn't break so in that
case well my egg didn't break now I have

3638
01:17:31,669 --> 01:17:31,679
case well my egg didn't break now I have
 

3639
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,189
case well my egg didn't break now I have
a lower

3640
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
a lower
 

3641
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,790
a lower
bound so I'm only unclear about floor is

3642
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:35,800
bound so I'm only unclear about floor is
 

3643
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,030
bound so I'm only unclear about floor is
f+ one uh but uh the upper bound didn't

3644
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:40,040
f+ one uh but uh the upper bound didn't
 

3645
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,430
f+ one uh but uh the upper bound didn't
change it's still

3646
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
change it's still
 

3647
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,950
change it's still
J and how many eggs do I have well my

3648
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:43,960
J and how many eggs do I have well my
 

3649
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,310
J and how many eggs do I have well my
egg didn't break so I can run down the

3650
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:45,320
egg didn't break so I can run down the
 

3651
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,430
egg didn't break so I can run down the
stairs which is going to be tiring right

3652
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:47,440
stairs which is going to be tiring right
 

3653
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,950
stairs which is going to be tiring right
I've accounted for that here but at

3654
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:48,960
I've accounted for that here but at
 

3655
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,030
I've accounted for that here but at
least I can reuse my egg so I didn't

3656
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,040
least I can reuse my egg so I didn't
 

3657
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:51,830
least I can reuse my egg so I didn't
lose

3658
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:51,840
lose
 

3659
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,709
lose
anything okay

3660
01:17:53,709 --> 01:17:53,719
anything okay
 

3661
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:55,750
anything okay
okay

3662
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:55,760
okay
 

3663
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,390
okay
and I get to choose so notice

3664
01:17:59,390 --> 01:17:59,400
and I get to choose so notice
 

3665
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,629
and I get to choose so notice
oops so do you guys see why there's a

3666
01:18:01,629 --> 01:18:01,639
oops so do you guys see why there's a
 

3667
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:03,590
oops so do you guys see why there's a
Max here essentially I have to account

3668
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
Max here essentially I have to account
 

3669
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,950
Max here essentially I have to account
for every possible scenario when I'm

3670
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:05,960
for every possible scenario when I'm
 

3671
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,229
for every possible scenario when I'm
when I'm designing my experimental

3672
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:08,239
when I'm designing my experimental
 

3673
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,470
when I'm designing my experimental
procedure but I get to minimize in the

3674
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:10,480
procedure but I get to minimize in the
 

3675
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,950
procedure but I get to minimize in the
sense that I can choose what floor at

3676
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:11,960
sense that I can choose what floor at
 

3677
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,110
sense that I can choose what floor at
every step so um right so in particular

3678
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:16,120
every step so um right so in particular
 

3679
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:21,310
every step so um right so in particular
uh my f here is in the range I to

3680
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:21,320
uh my f here is in the range I to
 

3681
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,910
uh my f here is in the range I to
J like that

3682
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:23,920
J like that
 

3683
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,229
J like that
okay and now we have our recursive

3684
01:18:25,229 --> 01:18:25,239
okay and now we have our recursive
 

3685
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:27,030
okay and now we have our recursive
formula for our our our egg drop that

3686
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:27,040
formula for our our our egg drop that
 

3687
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,110
formula for our our our egg drop that
minimizes total height um so now let's

3688
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:30,120
minimizes total height um so now let's
 

3689
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,910
minimizes total height um so now let's
uh finish off sort bot in four minutes

3690
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:31,920
uh finish off sort bot in four minutes
 

3691
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,709
uh finish off sort bot in four minutes
it's actually not too hard so I think

3692
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:33,719
it's actually not too hard so I think
 

3693
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:36,189
it's actually not too hard so I think
we'll actually make it for once by

3694
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:36,199
we'll actually make it for once by
 

3695
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:38,030
we'll actually make it for once by
removing 20% of the problems I'm

3696
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:38,040
removing 20% of the problems I'm
 

3697
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:46,470
removing 20% of the problems I'm
supposed to cover um all

3698
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:46,480

 

3699
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,790

right so first of all what's our

3700
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:48,800
right so first of all what's our
 

3701
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,790
right so first of all what's our
topological

3702
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:50,800
topological
 

3703
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,189
topological
order so

3704
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199

 

3705
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:58,390

this one seems kind of annoying

3706
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400
this one seems kind of annoying
 

3707
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,830
this one seems kind of annoying
because I think usually we think of

3708
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:00,840
because I think usually we think of
 

3709
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,990
because I think usually we think of
spending stuff in a lot of these uh

3710
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:04,000
spending stuff in a lot of these uh
 

3711
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,430
spending stuff in a lot of these uh
dynamic programming problems but do we

3712
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:05,440
dynamic programming problems but do we
 

3713
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,550
dynamic programming problems but do we
actually spend an egg not necessarily

3714
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:07,560
actually spend an egg not necessarily
 

3715
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:10,470
actually spend an egg not necessarily
right because in this recursive

3716
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:10,480
right because in this recursive
 

3717
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,229
right because in this recursive
call you know the number of eggs I had

3718
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:13,239
call you know the number of eggs I had
 

3719
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:14,629
call you know the number of eggs I had
remained the same so maybe that's not

3720
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:14,639
remained the same so maybe that's not
 

3721
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:16,709
remained the same so maybe that's not
actually a great way to establish a

3722
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:16,719
actually a great way to establish a
 

3723
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,229
actually a great way to establish a
topological order but instead what do we

3724
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:20,239
topological order but instead what do we
 

3725
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,669
topological order but instead what do we
know like what is in science the purpose

3726
01:19:22,669 --> 01:19:22,679
know like what is in science the purpose
 

3727
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:25,350
know like what is in science the purpose
of an experiment you know uh it's to

3728
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:25,360
of an experiment you know uh it's to
 

3729
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,270
of an experiment you know uh it's to
improve our understanding of the world

3730
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:27,280
improve our understanding of the world
 

3731
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,590
improve our understanding of the world
in this case our world consists only of

3732
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:29,600
in this case our world consists only of
 

3733
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,950
in this case our world consists only of
eggs and floors of buildings um and in

3734
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:31,960
eggs and floors of buildings um and in
 

3735
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,350
eggs and floors of buildings um and in
particular once I dropped that egg I

3736
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
particular once I dropped that egg I
 

3737
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,950
particular once I dropped that egg I
learned something about my building and

3738
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:34,960
learned something about my building and
 

3739
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,310
learned something about my building and
I narrowed down the range of floors that

3740
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:37,320
I narrowed down the range of floors that
 

3741
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,310
I narrowed down the range of floors that
are uncertain for me so in

3742
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,320
are uncertain for me so in
 

3743
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:46,990
are uncertain for me so in
particular I know that x i j e

3744
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:47,000
particular I know that x i j e
 

3745
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,830
particular I know that x i j e
only uh

3746
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:48,840
only uh
 

3747
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:54,390
only uh
depends on X I guess I prime J Prime e

3748
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:54,400
depends on X I guess I prime J Prime e
 

3749
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,390
depends on X I guess I prime J Prime e
Prime

3750
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400
Prime
 

3751
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,870
Prime
um with what well my sub problems I

3752
01:19:59,870 --> 01:19:59,880
um with what well my sub problems I
 

3753
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,470
um with what well my sub problems I
always have a smaller range of floors

3754
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:01,480
always have a smaller range of floors
 

3755
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,709
always have a smaller range of floors
than I did before so in particular J

3756
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:04,719
than I did before so in particular J
 

3757
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,510
than I did before so in particular J
Prime minus I prime is going to be

3758
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:07,520
Prime minus I prime is going to be
 

3759
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,149
Prime minus I prime is going to be
smaller strictly than J minus I and

3760
01:20:11,149 --> 01:20:11,159
smaller strictly than J minus I and
 

3761
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:14,629
smaller strictly than J minus I and
that'll give me my topological

3762
01:20:14,629 --> 01:20:14,639

 

3763
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,790

order cool uh and so that's actually to

3764
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:17,800
order cool uh and so that's actually to
 

3765
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,310
order cool uh and so that's actually to
I think the sort of annoying part other

3766
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:19,320
I think the sort of annoying part other
 

3767
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,030
I think the sort of annoying part other
than working out this Minimax expression

3768
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
than working out this Minimax expression
 

3769
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,149
than working out this Minimax expression
here uh the remaining uh things are not

3770
01:20:23,149 --> 01:20:23,159
here uh the remaining uh things are not
 

3771
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:28,709
here uh the remaining uh things are not
so hard so uh what are our base cases

3772
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:28,719
so hard so uh what are our base cases
 

3773
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:32,070
so hard so uh what are our base cases
well let's say I have zero eggs left but

3774
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,080
well let's say I have zero eggs left but
 

3775
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,510
well let's say I have zero eggs left but
I still have a set of Uncertain floors

3776
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:34,520
I still have a set of Uncertain floors
 

3777
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,310
I still have a set of Uncertain floors
that's bad news yeah so yeah so that

3778
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:39,320
that's bad news yeah so yeah so that
 

3779
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,149
that's bad news yeah so yeah so that
should be

3780
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:41,159
should be
 

3781
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:44,870
should be
infinity and the reason um is of course

3782
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:44,880
infinity and the reason um is of course
 

3783
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,470
infinity and the reason um is of course
um I'm going to take the Min here right

3784
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480
um I'm going to take the Min here right
 

3785
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,110
um I'm going to take the Min here right
and so I obviously I should never choose

3786
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:50,120
and so I obviously I should never choose
 

3787
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,470
and so I obviously I should never choose
Infinity as a as a Min um so in other

3788
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
Infinity as a as a Min um so in other
 

3789
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,830
Infinity as a as a Min um so in other
words I I should never choose an option

3790
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:53,840
words I I should never choose an option
 

3791
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,070
words I I should never choose an option
for a floor that could possibly lead me

3792
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,080
for a floor that could possibly lead me
 

3793
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,669
for a floor that could possibly lead me
to an uncertain scenario um when I run

3794
01:20:58,669 --> 01:20:58,679
to an uncertain scenario um when I run
 

3795
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:02,310
to an uncertain scenario um when I run
out of achs yeah um in addition to that

3796
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:02,320
out of achs yeah um in addition to that
 

3797
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,870
out of achs yeah um in addition to that
there's another base case here right so

3798
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
there's another base case here right so
 

3799
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,510
there's another base case here right so
this is like I've got no eggs left but

3800
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:06,520
this is like I've got no eggs left but
 

3801
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,950
this is like I've got no eggs left but
some FL us to check uh there's a second

3802
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:09,960
some FL us to check uh there's a second
 

3803
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,510
some FL us to check uh there's a second
one

3804
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
one
 

3805
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,270
one
I IUS one e so in this case I've got e

3806
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:16,280
I IUS one e so in this case I've got e
 

3807
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,510
I IUS one e so in this case I've got e
eggs left and I'm done right i' I've

3808
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:18,520
eggs left and I'm done right i' I've
 

3809
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,629
eggs left and I'm done right i' I've
narrowed it down to uh uh the bounce

3810
01:21:21,629 --> 01:21:21,639
narrowed it down to uh uh the bounce
 

3811
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:23,110
narrowed it down to uh uh the bounce
incidentally the way I wrote it in terms

3812
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:23,120
incidentally the way I wrote it in terms
 

3813
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,110
incidentally the way I wrote it in terms
of inclusive versus exclusive might be a

3814
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:25,120
of inclusive versus exclusive might be a
 

3815
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,229
of inclusive versus exclusive might be a
little

3816
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:26,239
little
 

3817
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,430
little
fishy over here you guys shouldn't be

3818
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:28,440
fishy over here you guys shouldn't be
 

3819
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,110
fishy over here you guys shouldn't be
off by one like your inspector often is

3820
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,120
off by one like your inspector often is
 

3821
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,590
off by one like your inspector often is
um but in any event you're you're zero

3822
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:33,600
um but in any event you're you're zero
 

3823
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,750
um but in any event you're you're zero
right there's no more floors left to

3824
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:34,760
right there's no more floors left to
 

3825
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,070
right there's no more floors left to
check you you've narrowed it down to a

3826
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
check you you've narrowed it down to a
 

3827
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,430
check you you've narrowed it down to a
range of one again something that I'm

3828
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:38,440
range of one again something that I'm
 

3829
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,550
range of one again something that I'm
out of time so I'm not going to check

3830
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:39,560
out of time so I'm not going to check
 

3831
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,350
out of time so I'm not going to check
carefully is if my bounds are inclusive

3832
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:42,360
carefully is if my bounds are inclusive
 

3833
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,910
carefully is if my bounds are inclusive
should that be i j minus one I IUS one

3834
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:44,920
should that be i j minus one I IUS one
 

3835
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,030
should that be i j minus one I IUS one
or just I I but I think you guys are all

3836
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
or just I I but I think you guys are all
 

3837
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,390
or just I I but I think you guys are all
smart enough to work that out at home

3838
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:49,400
smart enough to work that out at home
 

3839
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,430
smart enough to work that out at home
what should my original case be well now

3840
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:52,440
what should my original case be well now
 

3841
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,430
what should my original case be well now
I have all the floors to check and all

3842
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:55,440
I have all the floors to check and all
 

3843
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,189
I have all the floors to check and all
my eggs in my uh metaphorical basket

3844
01:21:58,189 --> 01:21:58,199
my eggs in my uh metaphorical basket
 

3845
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:04,750
my eggs in my uh metaphorical basket
here so I have um floors is one 2 N here

3846
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:04,760
here so I have um floors is one 2 N here
 

3847
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,229
here so I have um floors is one 2 N here
uh and the problem tells me I have K

3848
01:22:07,229 --> 01:22:07,239
uh and the problem tells me I have K
 

3849
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:10,270
uh and the problem tells me I have K
eggs when I start and then finally I

3850
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:10,280
eggs when I start and then finally I
 

3851
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:15,229
eggs when I start and then finally I
need to do my uh sub problems

3852
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:15,239

 

3853
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:17,669

here I think you can actually simplify

3854
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:17,679
here I think you can actually simplify
 

3855
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:18,790
here I think you can actually simplify
the the argument that that's written

3856
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:18,800
the the argument that that's written
 

3857
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,590
the the argument that that's written
down a tiny bit um and just again look

3858
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:21,600
down a tiny bit um and just again look
 

3859
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,910
down a tiny bit um and just again look
at your your sub problems so they're

3860
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:22,920
at your your sub problems so they're
 

3861
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,510
at your your sub problems so they're
indexed by three

3862
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:24,520
indexed by three
 

3863
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,310
indexed by three
numbers I'm going to do a really

3864
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:26,320
numbers I'm going to do a really
 

3865
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,910
numbers I'm going to do a really
conservative estimate I think the

3866
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:27,920
conservative estimate I think the
 

3867
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,110
conservative estimate I think the
problem actually works out a better

3868
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:29,120
problem actually works out a better
 

3869
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,669
problem actually works out a better
estimate but then ASM totically it's the

3870
01:22:30,669 --> 01:22:30,679
estimate but then ASM totically it's the
 

3871
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,510
estimate but then ASM totically it's the
same um what's our bound on the first

3872
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:34,520
same um what's our bound on the first
 

3873
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,110
same um what's our bound on the first
and second index well they're both just

3874
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,120
and second index well they're both just
 

3875
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,590
and second index well they're both just
the index of floors um which which go

3876
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:39,600
the index of floors um which which go
 

3877
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,550
the index of floors um which which go
between zero and and N yeah obviously

3878
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
between zero and and N yeah obviously
 

3879
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,830
between zero and and N yeah obviously
you could do better than that because

3880
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:43,840
you could do better than that because
 

3881
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,629
you could do better than that because
the lower floor is always less than the

3882
01:22:45,629 --> 01:22:45,639
the lower floor is always less than the
 

3883
01:22:45,639 --> 01:22:46,830
the lower floor is always less than the
Upper Floor which is what the problem

3884
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:46,840
Upper Floor which is what the problem
 

3885
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,790
Upper Floor which is what the problem
accounts for um but if I'm being lazy

3886
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:49,800
accounts for um but if I'm being lazy
 

3887
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,189
accounts for um but if I'm being lazy
then you know well there's n

3888
01:22:53,189 --> 01:22:53,199
then you know well there's n
 

3889
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,590
then you know well there's n
squared uh sub problems to account for

01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:55,600
squared uh sub problems to account for
 

3891
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,430

the two floors uh and the third index uh
 

3893
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,910
the two floors uh and the third index uh
is is your eggs which you have MOS K

of okay uh how much work um do we have

3896
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:07,400
of okay uh how much work um do we have
 

3897
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,990
of okay uh how much work um do we have
per sub problem well uh let's see here

3898
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:11,000
per sub problem well uh let's see here
 

3899
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,910
per sub problem well uh let's see here
there's a for Loop over f f is over

3900
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:13,920
there's a for Loop over f f is over
 

3901
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,910
there's a for Loop over f f is over

conservative right well there's a most

3904
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:18,800
conservative right well there's a most
 

3905
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,430
conservative right well there's a most
uh n uh Flor is total my build and so

3906
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:23,440
uh n uh Flor is total my build and so
 

3907
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,229
uh n uh Flor is total my build and so
that leads us to a runtime of n Cub K

3908
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:27,239
that leads us to a runtime of n Cub K
 

3909
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:29,189
that leads us to a runtime of n Cub K
which is what we wanted at the end of

3910
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:29,199
which is what we wanted at the end of
 

3911
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:32,149
which is what we wanted at the end of
the day okay

3912
01:23:32,149 --> 01:23:32,159
the day okay
 

3913
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,550
the day okay
um there should be a big O here because

3914
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560
um there should be a big O here because
 

3915
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,550
um there should be a big O here because
I think technically this is n plus one

3916
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560
I think technically this is n plus one
 

3917
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,910
I think technically this is n plus one
to account for floor

3918
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:38,920

okay and that uh that solves our our ACH

3922
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:44,480
okay and that uh that solves our our ACH
 

3923
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,629
okay and that uh that solves our our ACH
drop uh experiment again I think this is

3924
01:23:46,629 --> 01:23:46,639
drop uh experiment again I think this is
 

3925
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,350
drop uh experiment again I think this is
a nice one and I think in my mind

3926
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:48,360
a nice one and I think in my mind
 

3927
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,950
a nice one and I think in my mind
actually in terms of dynamic programming

3928
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:49,960
actually in terms of dynamic programming
 

3929
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,149
actually in terms of dynamic programming
this is one of the harder things to get

3930
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:52,159
this is one of the harder things to get
 

3931
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:53,830
this is one of the harder things to get
right which are these sort of

3932
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:53,840
right which are these sort of
 

3933
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,550
right which are these sort of
Minimax games you could probably I'd

3934
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:57,560
Minimax games you could probably I'd
 

3935
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,870
Minimax games you could probably I'd
have to think about it which in my

3936
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:58,880
have to think about it which in my
 

3937
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,910
have to think about it which in my
negative -2 minutes I'm not going to

3938
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:00,920
negative -2 minutes I'm not going to
 

3939
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:05,550
negative -2 minutes I'm not going to
have time to do I think in in lecture

3940
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:05,560
have time to do I think in in lecture
 

3941
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,990
have time to do I think in in lecture
the way that we solved Minimax problem

3942
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:07,000
the way that we solved Minimax problem
 

3943
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,709
the way that we solved Minimax problem
was we separated out the Min and the Max

3944
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:08,719
was we separated out the Min and the Max
 

3945
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:10,149
was we separated out the Min and the Max
and we thought of there being two

3946
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159
and we thought of there being two
 

3947
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,470
and we thought of there being two
dynamic programming problems that were

3948
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:11,480
dynamic programming problems that were
 

3949
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,229
dynamic programming problems that were
sort of interacting with each other you

3950
01:24:13,229 --> 01:24:13,239
sort of interacting with each other you
 

3951
01:24:13,239 --> 01:24:15,110
sort of interacting with each other you
could probably write this one in that

3952
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,120
could probably write this one in that
 

3953
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,590
could probably write this one in that
form as well I guess just by kind of

3954
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:16,600
form as well I guess just by kind of
 

3955
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,310
form as well I guess just by kind of
pulling this term out and thinking of it

3956
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,320
pulling this term out and thinking of it
 

3957
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,750
pulling this term out and thinking of it
as a different array um but this form is

3958
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:21,760
as a different array um but this form is
 

3959
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,229
as a different array um but this form is
perfectly fine too either one's all

3960
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:23,239
perfectly fine too either one's all
 

3961
01:24:23,239 --> 01:24:24,510
perfectly fine too either one's all
right but in my mind these are are sort

3962
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:24,520
right but in my mind these are are sort
 

3963
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,149
right but in my mind these are are sort
of the hardest things to get right in

3964
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159
of the hardest things to get right in
 

3965
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,709
of the hardest things to get right in
dynamic programming so I would choose

3966
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:27,719
dynamic programming so I would choose
 

3967
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:31,470
dynamic programming so I would choose
whichever one jibes in your uh brain so

3968
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:31,480
whichever one jibes in your uh brain so
 

3969
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,110
whichever one jibes in your uh brain so
uh in your thing should we choose to

3970
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:34,120
uh in your thing should we choose to
 

3971
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,870
uh in your thing should we choose to
leave it alone there is a fifth problem

3972
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:35,880
leave it alone there is a fifth problem
 

3973
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,510
leave it alone there is a fifth problem
here which as usual I haven't managed to

3974
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:38,520
here which as usual I haven't managed to
 

3975
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,310
here which as usual I haven't managed to
uh get to where you're kind of building

3976
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
uh get to where you're kind of building
 

3977
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,229
uh get to where you're kind of building
Walls by placing tiles this is an

3978
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
Walls by placing tiles this is an
 

3979
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:43,950
Walls by placing tiles this is an
interesting one because your runtime is

3980
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:43,960
interesting one because your runtime is
 

3981
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,990
interesting one because your runtime is
exponential um but the problem tells you

3982
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,000
exponential um but the problem tells you
 

3983
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,990
exponential um but the problem tells you
that that's

3984
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:47,000
that that's
 

3985
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,830
that that's
allowed but there's like some

3986
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:48,840
allowed but there's like some
 

3987
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,189
allowed but there's like some
exponential things which are okay and

3988
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:50,199
exponential things which are okay and
 

3989
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:51,870
exponential things which are okay and
some that are not right like essentially

3990
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:51,880
some that are not right like essentially
 

3991
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,629
some that are not right like essentially
what you don't want is like product of

3992
01:24:53,629 --> 01:24:53,639
what you don't want is like product of
 

3993
01:24:53,639 --> 01:24:55,149
what you don't want is like product of
two giant exponentials you'd like to

3994
01:24:55,149 --> 01:24:55,159
two giant exponentials you'd like to
 

3995
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:58,070
two giant exponentials you'd like to
just get it down to one um basically

3996
01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:58,080
just get it down to one um basically
 

3997
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,870
just get it down to one um basically
saying it's going to be polom if you a

3998
01:24:59,870 --> 01:24:59,880
saying it's going to be polom if you a
 

3999
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,070
saying it's going to be polom if you a
small height that's right or it's it's

4000
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:02,080
small height that's right or it's it's
 

4001
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,750
small height that's right or it's it's
polinomial in everything except for the

4002
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,760
polinomial in everything except for the
 

4003
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,430
polinomial in everything except for the
things that's exponential in and and and

4004
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:06,440
things that's exponential in and and and
 

4005
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,229
things that's exponential in and and and
moreover the things it's exponential in

4006
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:08,239
moreover the things it's exponential in
 

4007
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,109
moreover the things it's exponential in
are are small and and the problem say

4008
01:25:10,109 --> 01:25:10,119
are are small and and the problem say
 

4009
01:25:10,119 --> 01:25:11,870
are are small and and the problem say
that so I I encourage you guys to take a

4010
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:11,880
that so I I encourage you guys to take a
 

4011
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,070
that so I I encourage you guys to take a
look because it really does take some

4012
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:13,080
look because it really does take some
 

4013
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,470
look because it really does take some
time to logic through it but the setup

4014
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
time to logic through it but the setup
 

4015
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,669
time to logic through it but the setup
for that problem is I think longer than

4016
01:25:16,669 --> 01:25:16,679
for that problem is I think longer than
 

4017
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:19,189
for that problem is I think longer than
my glacially slow board uh writing can

4018
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
my glacially slow board uh writing can
 

4019
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,030
my glacially slow board uh writing can
can handle um but with that uh we'll

4020
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:22,040
can handle um but with that uh we'll
 

4021
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:27,070
can handle um but with that uh we'll
call for the

4022
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:27,080

 

4023
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,080
