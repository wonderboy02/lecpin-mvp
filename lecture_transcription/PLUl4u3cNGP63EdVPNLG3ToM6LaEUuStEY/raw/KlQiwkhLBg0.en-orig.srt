go over a bunch of example problems
which i believe are mostly lifted from

134

168
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
last night i woke up and realized my
 

169
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,710
last night i woke up and realized my
answer to the last problem was totally

170
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
answer to the last problem was totally
 

171
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,670
answer to the last problem was totally
wrong

172
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
wrong
 

173
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,869
wrong
uh so if you feel that way sometimes the

174
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
uh so if you feel that way sometimes the
 

175
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,190
uh so if you feel that way sometimes the
feeling is mutual

176
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
feeling is mutual
 

177
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,509
feeling is mutual
so in any event there are four problems

178
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
so in any event there are four problems
 

179
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,790
so in any event there are four problems
on your handout

180
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
on your handout
 

181
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,070
on your handout
that roughly i think are in

182
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
that roughly i think are in
 

183
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,270
that roughly i think are in
correspondence with the stuff we've

184
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
correspondence with the stuff we've
 

185
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,949
correspondence with the stuff we've
taught over the last week or so

186
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
taught over the last week or so
 

187
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,990
taught over the last week or so
so the first problem involves

188
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
so the first problem involves
 

189
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,229
so the first problem involves
recurrences the second involves

190
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
recurrences the second involves
 

191
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,430
recurrences the second involves
infinity stones the third involves uh

192
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
infinity stones the third involves uh
 

193
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,949
infinity stones the third involves uh
some kind of a cue stack

194
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
some kind of a cue stack
 

195
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,430
some kind of a cue stack
structure uh and the uh the fourth

196
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
structure uh and the uh the fourth
 

197
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,869
structure uh and the uh the fourth
involves like all kinds of things

198
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
involves like all kinds of things
 

199
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,550
involves like all kinds of things
talking to each other in a way that i

200
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
talking to each other in a way that i
 

201
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,670
talking to each other in a way that i
got wrong

202
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
got wrong
 

203
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,390
got wrong
um so i guess for lack of a more

204
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
um so i guess for lack of a more
 

205
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,589
um so i guess for lack of a more
creative thing we'll just go through

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
that way um but since you guys are the
 

217
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,630
that way um but since you guys are the
people in the room you have the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,469

uh i believe that master really is just

320
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
uh i believe that master really is just
 

321
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,830
uh i believe that master really is just
because it's general right there's not

322
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
because it's general right there's not
 

323
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,270
because it's general right there's not
like a guy named master but i noticed

324
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
like a guy named master but i noticed
 

325
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,629
like a guy named master but i noticed
that it was capitalized a lot in the

326
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
that it was capitalized a lot in the
 

327
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,150
that it was capitalized a lot in the

329
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,710

but in any event uh the basic idea is

330
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
but in any event uh the basic idea is
 

331
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,390
but in any event uh the basic idea is
that i have some recurrence that looks

332
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
that i have some recurrence that looks
 

333
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,670
that i have some recurrence that looks
uh like the following

334
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
uh like the following
 

335
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,270
uh like the following
which is t of n equals uh a

336
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
which is t of n equals uh a
 

337
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,830
which is t of n equals uh a
t of n over b uh

338
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
t of n over b uh
 

339
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,590
t of n over b uh
plus f of

340
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
plus f of
 

341
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,629
plus f of
n right so for instance uh

342
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
n right so for instance uh
 

343
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,189
n right so for instance uh
in merge sort uh for a tiny bit of

344
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
in merge sort uh for a tiny bit of
 

345
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,550
in merge sort uh for a tiny bit of
review remember that we kind of split

346
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
review remember that we kind of split
 

347
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,749
review remember that we kind of split
into two pieces

348
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
into two pieces
 

349
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,749
into two pieces
so both a and b and merge short would be

350
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
so both a and b and merge short would be
 

351
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,950
so both a and b and merge short would be
two yeah

352
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
two yeah
 

353
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,790
two yeah
and the amount of work that i do in the

354
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
and the amount of work that i do in the
 

355
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,710
and the amount of work that i do in the
merge step is kind of like n

356
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
merge step is kind of like n
 

357
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,990
merge step is kind of like n
so that's how to fill in these different

358
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
so that's how to fill in these different
 

359
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,230
so that's how to fill in these different
constants there and the question is

360
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
constants there and the question is
 

361
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,189
constants there and the question is
asymptotically

362
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
asymptotically
 

363
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,830
asymptotically
what does this function look like and of

364
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
what does this function look like and of
 

365
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,270
what does this function look like and of
course that's not totally obvious from

366
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
course that's not totally obvious from
 

367
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,870
course that's not totally obvious from
this formula because i've defined t

368
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
this formula because i've defined t
 

369
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,629
this formula because i've defined t
in terms of itself right and that's the

370
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
in terms of itself right and that's the
 

371
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,469
in terms of itself right and that's the
sort of annoying part of solving

372
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
sort of annoying part of solving
 

373
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,510
sort of annoying part of solving
recurrences

374
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
recurrences
 

375
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,430
recurrences
and so master theorem and and i'll let

376
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
and so master theorem and and i'll let
 

377
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,430
and so master theorem and and i'll let
you guys review your your section notes

378
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
you guys review your your section notes
 

379
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,629
you guys review your your section notes
about precisely

380
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
about precisely
 

381
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,629
about precisely
how this gets proved uh it essentially

382
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
how this gets proved uh it essentially
 

383
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,150
how this gets proved uh it essentially
divides into three

384
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
divides into three
 

385
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,189
divides into three
cases uh and and the relevant numbers

386
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
cases uh and and the relevant numbers
 

387
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,830
cases uh and and the relevant numbers
here

388
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
here
 

389
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,510
here
are as follows right there's an a a b

390
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
are as follows right there's an a a b
 

391
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,430
are as follows right there's an a a b
and an f and so the a

392
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
and an f and so the a
 

393
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,710
and an f and so the a
is kind of like a branching factor right

394
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
is kind of like a branching factor right
 

395
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,550
is kind of like a branching factor right
so if you remember your computation tree

396
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
so if you remember your computation tree
 

397
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,629
so if you remember your computation tree
right like in merge sort you split it

398
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
right like in merge sort you split it
 

399
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,990
right like in merge sort you split it
into two

400
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
into two
 

401
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,629
into two
pieces right so that number is kind of

402
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
pieces right so that number is kind of
 

403
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,990
pieces right so that number is kind of
like a it's the number of splits that

404
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
like a it's the number of splits that
 

405
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,110
like a it's the number of splits that
you make

406
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
you make
 

407
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,150
you make
right uh b uh is the amount of that your

408
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
right uh b uh is the amount of that your
 

409
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,150
right uh b uh is the amount of that your
problem size reduces when you go to each

410
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
problem size reduces when you go to each
 

411
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,590
problem size reduces when you go to each
of those leafs

412
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
of those leafs
 

413
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,950
of those leafs
then finally f is the amount of work

414
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
then finally f is the amount of work
 

415
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,629
then finally f is the amount of work
that you do at each note yeah so

416
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
that you do at each note yeah so
 

417
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,070
that you do at each note yeah so
hopefully that the basic language makes

418
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
hopefully that the basic language makes
 

419
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,990
hopefully that the basic language makes
sense uh and then

420
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
sense uh and then
 

421
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,430
sense uh and then
essentially what you learned from master

422
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
essentially what you learned from master
 

423
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,670
essentially what you learned from master
theorem uh is that there's three uh

424
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
theorem uh is that there's three uh
 

425
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,230
theorem uh is that there's three uh
cases

426
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
cases
 

427
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,990
cases
the first is that f of n

428
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
the first is that f of n
 

429
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,870
the first is that f of n
uh looks like by the way in the

430
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
uh looks like by the way in the
 

431
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,230
uh looks like by the way in the
recitation notes for some reason it's

432
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
recitation notes for some reason it's
 

433
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,430
recitation notes for some reason it's
kind of written backward like they give

434
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
kind of written backward like they give
 

435
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,390
kind of written backward like they give
the answer

436
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
the answer
 

437
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,430
the answer
to master's theorem and then the

438
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
to master's theorem and then the
 

439
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,390
to master's theorem and then the
condition i'm going to write in the

440
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
condition i'm going to write in the
 

441
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,550
condition i'm going to write in the
other order um

442
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
other order um
 

443
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,150
other order um
right looks like the following which is

444
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
right looks like the following which is
 

445
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,990
right looks like the following which is
n to the log

446
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
n to the log
 

447
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,629
n to the log
base b of a minus epsilon

448
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639

 

449
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,480

for some

450
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,490

very conscientious about reading my

456
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
very conscientious about reading my
 

457
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,629
very conscientious about reading my
writing out loud as i write it down

458
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
writing out loud as i write it down
 

459
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,790
writing out loud as i write it down
all right and in that case what we find

460
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
all right and in that case what we find
 

461
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,150
all right and in that case what we find
is notice there's something kind of

462
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
is notice there's something kind of
 

463
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,909
is notice there's something kind of
magic here which is that this is just an

464
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
magic here which is that this is just an
 

465
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,309
magic here which is that this is just an
upper bound there's not a theta here so

466
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
upper bound there's not a theta here so
 

467
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,830
upper bound there's not a theta here so
it's okay if if f is below this thing

468
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
it's okay if if f is below this thing
 

469
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,270
it's okay if if f is below this thing
but in any event um the conclusion then

470
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
but in any event um the conclusion then
 

471
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,909
but in any event um the conclusion then
is that t

472
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
is that t
 

473
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,350
is that t
of n is big theta

474
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
of n is big theta
 

475
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,790
of n is big theta
of uh n to the log base

476
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
of uh n to the log base
 

477
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,670
of uh n to the log base
b of a it's kind of cool if you think

478
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
b of a it's kind of cool if you think
 

479
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,870
b of a it's kind of cool if you think
about it you only have an upper bound

480
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
about it you only have an upper bound
 

481
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,870
about it you only have an upper bound
for f but you get a nice a theta bound

482
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
for f but you get a nice a theta bound
 

483
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,430
for f but you get a nice a theta bound
for

484
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
for
 

485
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,510
for
t which is pretty cool the reason for

486
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
t which is pretty cool the reason for
 

487
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,550
t which is pretty cool the reason for
that is essentially the f

488
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
that is essentially the f
 

489
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,150
that is essentially the f
is sort of insignificant relative to the

that's case one case two
i'm gonna try and leave this on the

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
i'm gonna try and leave this on the
 

499
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,230
i'm gonna try and leave this on the
board as we actually solve these

500
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240

and what's the conclusion there then it

582
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
and what's the conclusion there then it
 

583
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,710
and what's the conclusion there then it
turns out that the f term sort of

turns out that the f term sort of
 

585
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,509
turns out that the f term sort of

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,509
something like this t of n
is equal to two t

672
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
is equal to two t
 

673
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,790
is equal to two t
of n over two uh

674
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
of n over two uh
 

675
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,870
of n over two uh
plus and then they have some other term

676
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
plus and then they have some other term
 

677
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,310
plus and then they have some other term
which they don't tell you anything about

678
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
which they don't tell you anything about
 

679
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,350
which they don't tell you anything about
beyond that it's big

680
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
beyond that it's big
 

681
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,150
beyond that it's big
o of theta of a big o of square root of

682
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
o of theta of a big o of square root of
 

683
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,750
o of theta of a big o of square root of
n

684
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
n
 

685
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,870
n
by the way this might mean that it

686
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
by the way this might mean that it
 

687
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,790
by the way this might mean that it
actually does order one work right like

688
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
actually does order one work right like
 

689
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,150
actually does order one work right like
it just has to be upper bounded by

690
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
it just has to be upper bounded by
 

691
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,350
it just has to be upper bounded by
square root of n that's the only thing

692
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
square root of n that's the only thing
 

693
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,790
square root of n that's the only thing
the problem's telling you

694
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
the problem's telling you
 

695
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,069
the problem's telling you
i'm going to keep kind of driving home

696
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
i'm going to keep kind of driving home
 

697
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,829
i'm going to keep kind of driving home
that point because i think everybody

698
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
that point because i think everybody
 

699
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,509
that point because i think everybody
including myself gets really sloppy

700
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
including myself gets really sloppy
 

701
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,110
including myself gets really sloppy
about like when is it o when is it theta

702
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
about like when is it o when is it theta
 

703
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,389
about like when is it o when is it theta
when's it omega

704
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
when's it omega
 

705
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,910
when's it omega
and so every single time you write one

706
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
and so every single time you write one
 

707
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,750
and so every single time you write one
of those letters down you should like

708
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
of those letters down you should like
 

709
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,269
of those letters down you should like
step back 50 feet and look at it and

710
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
step back 50 feet and look at it and
 

711
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,550
step back 50 feet and look at it and
think like did i do that right or did i

712
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
think like did i do that right or did i
 

713
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,990
think like did i do that right or did i
just write a greek letter

714
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
just write a greek letter
 

715
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,670
just write a greek letter
right and and make sure that you're

716
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
right and and make sure that you're
 

717
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,550
right and and make sure that you're
actually thinking through it logically

718
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
actually thinking through it logically
 

719
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,470
actually thinking through it logically
okay so um when i apply

720
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
okay so um when i apply
 

721
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,110
okay so um when i apply
master theorem in my everyday life what

722
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
master theorem in my everyday life what
 

723
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,389
master theorem in my everyday life what
i like to do is to say

724
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
i like to do is to say
 

725
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,509
i like to do is to say
okay somehow the really key quantity

726
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
okay somehow the really key quantity
 

727
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,230
okay somehow the really key quantity
in master theorem is this this this dude

728
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
in master theorem is this this this dude
 

729
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,550
in master theorem is this this this dude
right

730
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
right
 

731
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,870
right
n to the log base b of a right he just

732
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
n to the log base b of a right he just
 

733
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,069
n to the log base b of a right he just
keeps showing up in all these different

734
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
keeps showing up in all these different
 

735
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,430
keeps showing up in all these different
cases

736
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
cases
 

737
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,069
cases
so i might as well figure what that is

738
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
so i might as well figure what that is
 

739
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,150
so i might as well figure what that is
for my recurrence

740
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
for my recurrence
 

741
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,870
for my recurrence
yeah and then plug it in and check which

742
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
yeah and then plug it in and check which
 

743
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,110
yeah and then plug it in and check which
case i'm in does that make sense

744
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
case i'm in does that make sense
 

745
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,310
case i'm in does that make sense
so let's do that uh so first of all uh

746
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
so let's do that uh so first of all uh
 

747
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,389
so let's do that uh so first of all uh
what is a

748
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
what is a
 

749
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,590
what is a
in for this particular recurrence two

750
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600

 

751
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,430

what's b you're killing me guys on three

752
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
what's b you're killing me guys on three
 

753
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,150
what's b you're killing me guys on three
one two

754
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
one two
 

755
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,350
one two
three okay the enthusiasm is

756
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
three okay the enthusiasm is
 

757
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,030
three okay the enthusiasm is
overwhelming

758
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
overwhelming
 

759
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,310
overwhelming
okay and what do we know about the

760
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
okay and what do we know about the
 

761
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,629
okay and what do we know about the
function f

762
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
function f
 

763
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,629
function f
yeah it's big o of root n we don't know

764
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
yeah it's big o of root n we don't know
 

765
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,829
yeah it's big o of root n we don't know
that it equals root n

766
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
that it equals root n
 

767
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,150
that it equals root n
but we do know that it's at most upper

768
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
but we do know that it's at most upper
 

769
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,350
but we do know that it's at most upper
bounded by something that kind of looks

770
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
bounded by something that kind of looks
 

771
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,509
bounded by something that kind of looks
like root

772
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
like root
 

773
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,710
like root
eric gave me a whole lesson on this

774
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
eric gave me a whole lesson on this
 

775
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,790
eric gave me a whole lesson on this
chalk and i'm still failing at it

776
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
chalk and i'm still failing at it
 

777
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,430
chalk and i'm still failing at it
okay so uh right so now uh that gives us

778
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
okay so uh right so now uh that gives us
 

779
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,310
okay so uh right so now uh that gives us
everything we need

780
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
everything we need
 

781
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,710
everything we need
uh to compute n to the log base b of a

782
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
uh to compute n to the log base b of a
 

783
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,230
uh to compute n to the log base b of a
we're gonna do this one real slowly and

784
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
we're gonna do this one real slowly and
 

785
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,110
we're gonna do this one real slowly and
then we're gonna do the next one a

786
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
then we're gonna do the next one a
 

787
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,710
then we're gonna do the next one a
little more fastly

788
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
little more fastly
 

789
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,230
little more fastly
quickly so n to the log

790
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
quickly so n to the log
 

791
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,069
quickly so n to the log
base b of a well that's

792
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
base b of a well that's
 

793
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,310
base b of a well that's
n to the log base 2

794
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320

 

795
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,350

of 2. maybe an idea what's

796
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
of 2. maybe an idea what's
 

797
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,910
of 2. maybe an idea what's
what's the log base two of two

798
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920

 

799
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,350

one okay i'll take it this okay

800
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
one okay i'll take it this okay
 

801
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,829
one okay i'll take it this okay
right and so then what does uh what does

802
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
right and so then what does uh what does
 

803
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,710
right and so then what does uh what does
master theorem

804
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
master theorem
 

805
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,150
master theorem
tell you well in some sense i want to

806
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
tell you well in some sense i want to
 

807
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,750
tell you well in some sense i want to
know what f

808
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
know what f
 

809
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,350
know what f
is which in this case looks like square

810
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
is which in this case looks like square
 

811
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,590
is which in this case looks like square
root of n compared to

812
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
root of n compared to
 

813
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,949
root of n compared to
what this is n to the first yeah

814
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
what this is n to the first yeah
 

815
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,949
what this is n to the first yeah
now first of all which of these two

816
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
now first of all which of these two
 

817
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,069
now first of all which of these two
things grows faster

818
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
things grows faster
 

819
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,389
things grows faster
this guy right so what do we know is

820
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
this guy right so what do we know is
 

821
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,110
this guy right so what do we know is
that f

822
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
that f
 

823
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,590
that f
is really kind of upper bounded by this

824
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
is really kind of upper bounded by this
 

825
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,389
is really kind of upper bounded by this
n here

826
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
n here
 

827
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,509
n here
upper bounded is not quite the right

828
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
upper bounded is not quite the right
 

829
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,949
upper bounded is not quite the right
term because big o allows for some

830
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
term because big o allows for some
 

831
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,470
term because big o allows for some
wiggle room but like asymptotically

832
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
wiggle room but like asymptotically
 

833
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,629
wiggle room but like asymptotically
hopefully you guys get this concept

834
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
hopefully you guys get this concept
 

835
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,949
hopefully you guys get this concept
okay so uh so in particular

836
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
okay so uh so in particular
 

837
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,750
okay so uh so in particular
let's see so so remember that f uh let's

838
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
let's see so so remember that f uh let's
 

839
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,910
let's see so so remember that f uh let's
maybe just write it again so f of n

840
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
maybe just write it again so f of n
 

841
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,030
maybe just write it again so f of n
is big o of square root of n but let's

842
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
is big o of square root of n but let's
 

843
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,750
is big o of square root of n but let's
write that

844
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
write that
 

845
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,990
write that
in a suggestive way as n to the one half

846
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
in a suggestive way as n to the one half
 

847
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,750
in a suggestive way as n to the one half
yeah in particular this is equal to big

848
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
yeah in particular this is equal to big
 

849
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,069
yeah in particular this is equal to big
o

850
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
o
 

851
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,030
o
of n to the one minus one half it's a

852
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
of n to the one minus one half it's a
 

853
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,550
of n to the one minus one half it's a
beautiful thing about one half

854
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560

 

855
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,910

yeah but what is n to the 1 well that's

856
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
yeah but what is n to the 1 well that's
 

857
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,990
yeah but what is n to the 1 well that's
n to the log base b of a

858
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
n to the log base b of a
 

859
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,470
n to the log base b of a
right that's what we just showed here

860
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
right that's what we just showed here
 

861
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,829
right that's what we just showed here
right

862
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
right
 

863
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,949
right
so this is really o

864
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
so this is really o
 

865
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,550
so this is really o
of n to the log b of a that's a

866
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
of n to the log b of a that's a
 

867
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,910
of n to the log b of a that's a
complicated way of writing the number

868
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
complicated way of writing the number
 

869
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,110
complicated way of writing the number
one

870
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
one
 

871
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,910
one
right minus one half and let's give one

872
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
right minus one half and let's give one
 

873
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,269
right minus one half and let's give one
half a special name too while we're at

874
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
half a special name too while we're at
 

875
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,629
half a special name too while we're at
it let's call him epsilon

876
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
it let's call him epsilon
 

877
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,189
it let's call him epsilon
or her yeah where

878
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
or her yeah where
 

879
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,550
or her yeah where
we take epsilon equals

880
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
we take epsilon equals
 

881
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,829
we take epsilon equals
see what i did there now what does it

882
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
see what i did there now what does it
 

883
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,870
see what i did there now what does it
tell me of uh

884
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
tell me of uh
 

885
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,389
tell me of uh
uh there are three different cases of

886
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
uh there are three different cases of
 

887
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,550
uh there are three different cases of
master's theorem and take a look at what

888
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
master's theorem and take a look at what
 

889
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,069
master's theorem and take a look at what
i just showed i showed that f

890
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
i just showed i showed that f
 

891
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,990
i just showed i showed that f
n is equal to big o of n to the log base

892
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
n is equal to big o of n to the log base
 

893
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,509
n is equal to big o of n to the log base
b of a minus epsilon

894
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
b of a minus epsilon
 

895
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,030
b of a minus epsilon
for sum epsilon that's equal to one-half

896
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
for sum epsilon that's equal to one-half
 

897
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,470
for sum epsilon that's equal to one-half
the beautiful thing about one-half is

898
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
the beautiful thing about one-half is
 

899
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,949
the beautiful thing about one-half is
that it is greater than zero

900
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
that it is greater than zero
 

901
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,230
that it is greater than zero
yeah so i think we have somewhat

902
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
yeah so i think we have somewhat
 

903
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,269
yeah so i think we have somewhat
laboriously

904
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
laboriously
 

905
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,230
laboriously
checked that we are in case one any uh

906
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
checked that we are in case one any uh
 

907
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,829
checked that we are in case one any uh
dissidence here

908
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
dissidence here
 

909
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,550
dissidence here
fabulous okay so in that case master's

910
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
fabulous okay so in that case master's
 

911
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,350
fabulous okay so in that case master's
theorem

912
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
theorem
 

913
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,189
theorem
basically you're just done right so what

914
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
basically you're just done right so what
 

915
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,870
basically you're just done right so what
is the conclusion

916
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880

 

917
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,350

exactly so t of n is theta of n to the

918
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
exactly so t of n is theta of n to the
 

919
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,870
exactly so t of n is theta of n to the
log base b of a but we already showed

920
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
log base b of a but we already showed
 

921
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,829
log base b of a but we already showed
that's equal to n

922
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839

 

923
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,870

so we're done

924
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880

 

925
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,629

all right any questions about how we uh

926
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
all right any questions about how we uh
 

927
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,150
all right any questions about how we uh
apply master theorem here

928
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
apply master theorem here
 

929
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,470
apply master theorem here
okay so now so here's the thing about

930
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
okay so now so here's the thing about
 

931
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,829
okay so now so here's the thing about
master swim do we learn anything about

932
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
master swim do we learn anything about
 

933
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,430
master swim do we learn anything about
like what this recursive function is

934
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
like what this recursive function is
 

935
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,990
like what this recursive function is
doing

936
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
doing
 

937
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,509
doing
no we just like did a bunch of work

938
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
no we just like did a bunch of work
 

939
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,790
no we just like did a bunch of work
plugged in some greek symbols and out

940
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
plugged in some greek symbols and out
 

941
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,189
plugged in some greek symbols and out
came

942
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
came
 

943
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,790
came
a big theta yeah um so

944
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
a big theta yeah um so
 

945
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,189
a big theta yeah um so
what we might want to do instead uh is

946
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
what we might want to do instead uh is
 

947
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,189
what we might want to do instead uh is
to use a method

948
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
to use a method
 

949
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,189
to use a method
that i'm still learning myself because

950
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
that i'm still learning myself because
 

951
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,710
that i'm still learning myself because
uh i'm not used to presenting it this

952
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
uh i'm not used to presenting it this
 

953
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,829
uh i'm not used to presenting it this
way but that's okay

954
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
way but that's okay
 

955
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,590
way but that's okay
uh which is to actually draw out the

956
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
uh which is to actually draw out the
 

957
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,949
uh which is to actually draw out the
tree of computation

958
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
tree of computation
 

959
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,189
tree of computation
yeah so let's actually do that so let's

960
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
yeah so let's actually do that so let's
 

961
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,389
yeah so let's actually do that so let's
say that i call

962
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
say that i call
 

963
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,590
say that i call
my function t of n so what does t

964
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
my function t of n so what does t
 

965
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,509
my function t of n so what does t
of n do well in some sense it does work

966
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
of n do well in some sense it does work
 

967
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,710
of n do well in some sense it does work
that kind of looks like the square root

968
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
that kind of looks like the square root
 

969
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,910
that kind of looks like the square root
of n

970
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
of n
 

971
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,829
of n
right and then it makes two function

972
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
right and then it makes two function
 

973
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,949
right and then it makes two function
calls

974
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
calls
 

975
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,670
calls
each of which has n over two amount of

976
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
each of which has n over two amount of
 

977
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,790
each of which has n over two amount of
data

978
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
data
 

979
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,629
data
yeah so so let's draw what this looks

980
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
yeah so so let's draw what this looks
 

981
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,790
yeah so so let's draw what this looks
like so the first thing that my function

982
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
like so the first thing that my function
 

983
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,749
like so the first thing that my function
might do

984
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
might do
 

985
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,110
might do
is work square root of n much

986
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
is work square root of n much
 

987
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,430
is work square root of n much
we put a little square root of n there

988
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
we put a little square root of n there
 

989
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,470
we put a little square root of n there
and now it makes two function calls

990
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
and now it makes two function calls
 

991
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,829
and now it makes two function calls
and how much work does each of these

992
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
and how much work does each of these
 

993
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,189
and how much work does each of these
guys do

994
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199

 

995
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,789

so when it calls t what goes into t

996
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
so when it calls t what goes into t
 

997
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,549
so when it calls t what goes into t
n over 2 exactly so it does square root

998
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
n over 2 exactly so it does square root
 

999
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,029
n over 2 exactly so it does square root
of n

1000
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
of n
 

1001
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,390
of n
over two amount of work

1002
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400

 

1003
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,909

at each of these two notes

1004
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919

 

1005
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,990

does that make sense okay so now

1006
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
does that make sense okay so now
 

1007
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,390
does that make sense okay so now
that's determined by the french you have

1008
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
that's determined by the french you have
 

1009
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,150
that's determined by the french you have
to be careful so the branching number in

1010
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
to be careful so the branching number in
 

1011
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,430
to be careful so the branching number in
this case they happen to be the same

1012
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
this case they happen to be the same
 

1013
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,710
this case they happen to be the same
the next problem we do they'll be

1014
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
the next problem we do they'll be
 

1015
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,190
the next problem we do they'll be
different um so they're both two here

1016
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
different um so they're both two here
 

1017
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,270
different um so they're both two here
the outside two refers to the fact that

1018
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
the outside two refers to the fact that
 

1019
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,630
the outside two refers to the fact that
there's two children

1020
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
there's two children
 

1021
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,230
there's two children
and the inside two refers to the fact

1022
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
and the inside two refers to the fact
 

1023
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,150
and the inside two refers to the fact
that i divided by two it's a fabulous

1024
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
that i divided by two it's a fabulous
 

1025
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,590
that i divided by two it's a fabulous
question because it's exactly what i got

1026
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
question because it's exactly what i got
 

1027
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,510
question because it's exactly what i got
wrong when i did this problem

1028
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
wrong when i did this problem
 

1029
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,870
wrong when i did this problem
okay so now each of these guys

1030
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
okay so now each of these guys
 

1031
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,669
okay so now each of these guys
calls uh one of their children yeah and

1032
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
calls uh one of their children yeah and
 

1033
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,150
calls uh one of their children yeah and
so

1034
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
so
 

1035
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,950
so
again the data divides by two right so

1036
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
again the data divides by two right so
 

1037
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,390
again the data divides by two right so
now

1038
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
now
 

1039
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,590
now
i have the square root of n over four

1040
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600

 

1041
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,190

like this yeah

1042
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200

 

1043
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,549

if you're wondering inside of each of

1044
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
if you're wondering inside of each of
 

1045
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,070
if you're wondering inside of each of
these circles it says square root of n

1046
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
these circles it says square root of n
 

1047
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,270
these circles it says square root of n
over four

1048
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
over four
 

1049
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,630
over four
okay

1050
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640

 

1051
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,750

okay so let's say that uh

1052
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
okay so let's say that uh
 

1053
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,230
okay so let's say that uh
so so now meanwhile in our function call

1054
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
so so now meanwhile in our function call
 

1055
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,590
so so now meanwhile in our function call
tree here

1056
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600

1057
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,510

how many nodes are in just like the

1058
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
how many nodes are in just like the
 

1059
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,590
how many nodes are in just like the

00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
how many nodes are in the second level
 

1067
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,990
how many nodes are in the second level

1068
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000

1071
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,990

here there's four yeah which is two

1072
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
here there's four yeah which is two
 

1073
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,630
here there's four yeah which is two
squared

1074
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640

1077
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,150

and so on okay so now we kind of have

1078
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
and so on okay so now we kind of have
 

1079
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,350
and so on okay so now we kind of have
some pictorial

1080
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
some pictorial
 

1081
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,830
some pictorial
representation of what's going on inside

1083
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,789
representation of what's going on inside
of our uh

1084
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
of our uh
 

1085
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,710
of our uh
recurrence if you look at the courses i

1086
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
recurrence if you look at the courses i
 

1087
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,990
recurrence if you look at the courses i
wrote out i wrote out one more layer

1088
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
wrote out i wrote out one more layer
 

1089
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,870
wrote out i wrote out one more layer
just for

1090
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
just for
 

1091
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,909
just for
for fun and profit um so now let's see

1092
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
for fun and profit um so now let's see
 

1093
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,350
for fun and profit um so now let's see
how this helps us actually solve our

1094
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
how this helps us actually solve our
 

1095
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,789
how this helps us actually solve our
recurrence

1096
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
recurrence
 

1097
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,549
recurrence
so what do we know

1098
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
so what do we know
 

1099
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,070
so what do we know
how many levels are in this tree well

1100
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
how many levels are in this tree well
 

1101
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,590
how many levels are in this tree well
our algorithm kind of stops when the

1102
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
our algorithm kind of stops when the
 

1103
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,390
our algorithm kind of stops when the
input to t

1104
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
input to t
 

1105
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,590
input to t
looks like one right so

1106
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
looks like one right so
 

1107
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,350
looks like one right so
since this divides by two each time

1108
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
since this divides by two each time
 

1109
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,390
since this divides by two each time
uh the tree has a log base two

1110
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
uh the tree has a log base two
 

1111
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,750
uh the tree has a log base two
of n levels in the tree

1112
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
of n levels in the tree
 

1113
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,190
of n levels in the tree
yeah and each level

1114
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
yeah and each level
 

1115
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,590
yeah and each level
does how much work

1116
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600

 

1117
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,270

so be careful so uh each level

1118
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280

 

1119
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,990

let's call that level l right so we'll

1120
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
let's call that level l right so we'll
 

1121
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,390
let's call that level l right so we'll
we'll say

1122
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
we'll say
 

1123
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,190
we'll say
l equals zero l equals one and so on

1124
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
l equals zero l equals one and so on
 

1125
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,390
l equals zero l equals one and so on
so there's two different things we have

1126
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
so there's two different things we have
 

1127
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,750
so there's two different things we have
to account for when we account for the

1128
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
to account for when we account for the
 

1129
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,870
to account for when we account for the
work in this level

1130
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
work in this level
 

1131
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,630
work in this level
right one is the square root of n over

1132
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
right one is the square root of n over
 

1133
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,710
right one is the square root of n over
two and a single node the other is the

1134
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
two and a single node the other is the
 

1135
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,990
two and a single node the other is the
fact that there's two different nodes in

1136
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
fact that there's two different nodes in
 

1137
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,190
fact that there's two different nodes in
the level

1138
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
the level
 

1139
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,909
the level
so in level l

1140
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919

 

1141
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,909

so the amount of work in level l is

1142
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
so the amount of work in level l is
 

1143
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,270
so the amount of work in level l is
equal to the product of those two things

1144
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
equal to the product of those two things
 

1145
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,549
equal to the product of those two things
right so how many nodes are in level l

1146
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
right so how many nodes are in level l
 

1147
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,430
right so how many nodes are in level l
two to the l yeah okay

1148
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440

 

1149
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,590

and how much work does each one of those

1150
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
and how much work does each one of those
 

1151
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,070
and how much work does each one of those
nodes do

1152
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
nodes do
 

1153
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,990
nodes do
it's like n over two to the l yeah

1154
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
it's like n over two to the l yeah
 

1155
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,950
it's like n over two to the l yeah
so uh a different way of writing that is

1156
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
so uh a different way of writing that is
 

1157
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,230
so uh a different way of writing that is
the square root of

1158
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
the square root of
 

1159
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,909
the square root of
n times two to the minus l like that

1160
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
n times two to the minus l like that
 

1161
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,870
n times two to the minus l like that
this is just n over two to the l

1162
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
this is just n over two to the l
 

1163
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,390
this is just n over two to the l
fabulous so now we have everything we

1164
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
fabulous so now we have everything we
 

1165
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,029
fabulous so now we have everything we
need to

1166
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
need to
 

1167
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,950
need to
actually work out our solution to the

1168
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
actually work out our solution to the
 

1169
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,230
actually work out our solution to the
recurrence

1170
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
recurrence
 

1171
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,990
recurrence
okay yes what does that say this is

1172
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
okay yes what does that say this is
 

1173
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,909
okay yes what does that say this is
n times two to the minus l

1174
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
n times two to the minus l
 

1175
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,669
n times two to the minus l
i appreciate this i'm gonna i'm gonna

1176
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
i appreciate this i'm gonna i'm gonna
 

1177
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,029
i appreciate this i'm gonna i'm gonna
work on this more

1178
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
work on this more
 

1179
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,549
work on this more
and that's why i also share it online

1180
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
and that's why i also share it online
 

1181
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,070
and that's why i also share it online
the handwritten notes is what this is

1182
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
the handwritten notes is what this is
 

1183
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,350
the handwritten notes is what this is
literally a scan of the page that i'm

1184
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
literally a scan of the page that i'm
 

1185
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,950
literally a scan of the page that i'm
holding in front of you

1186
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
holding in front of you
 

1187
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,470
holding in front of you
okay so if we want the total amount of

1188
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
okay so if we want the total amount of
 

1189
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,390
okay so if we want the total amount of
work in our tree

1190
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
work in our tree
 

1191
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,070
work in our tree
right if we want to account for all of t

1192
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
right if we want to account for all of t
 

1193
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,990
right if we want to account for all of t
of n then what are we going to do

1194
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
of n then what are we going to do
 

1195
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,270
of n then what are we going to do
well we have to sum starting at level

1196
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280
well we have to sum starting at level
 

1197
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,070
well we have to sum starting at level
0. i'm using l instead of i because i'm

1198
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
0. i'm using l instead of i because i'm
 

1199
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,909
0. i'm using l instead of i because i'm
an analysis person and i is the square

1200
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
an analysis person and i is the square
 

1201
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,590
an analysis person and i is the square
root of -1 and i don't like eyes in my

1202
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
root of -1 and i don't like eyes in my
 

1203
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,630
root of -1 and i don't like eyes in my
algorithms

1204
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
algorithms
 

1205
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,510
algorithms
but in any event how many total levels

1206
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,520
but in any event how many total levels
 

1207
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,870
but in any event how many total levels
are there in my tree well we know that

1208
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
are there in my tree well we know that
 

1209
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,830
are there in my tree well we know that
there's

1210
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
there's
 

1211
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,470
there's
log base two of uh n

1212
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
log base two of uh n
 

1213
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,990
log base two of uh n
right and now we have to sum this

1214
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
right and now we have to sum this
 

1215
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,149
right and now we have to sum this
quantity for all those levels right

1216
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
quantity for all those levels right
 

1217
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,990
quantity for all those levels right
two to the l the square root

1218
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
two to the l the square root
 

1219
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,549
two to the l the square root
of n times 2 to the minus l like that

1220
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
of n times 2 to the minus l like that
 

1221
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,789
of n times 2 to the minus l like that
okay and then what do we know secretly

1222
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799
okay and then what do we know secretly
 

1223
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,710
okay and then what do we know secretly
from from the master theorem is that we

1224
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
from from the master theorem is that we
 

1225
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,909
from from the master theorem is that we
we're suspecting that this is going to

1226
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
we're suspecting that this is going to
 

1227
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,350
we're suspecting that this is going to
be theta then right so that's all we

1228
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
be theta then right so that's all we
 

1229
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,470
be theta then right so that's all we
gotta check

1230
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
gotta check
 

1231
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,070
gotta check
okay so let's let's do that real fast

1232
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
okay so let's let's do that real fast
 

1233
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,270
okay so let's let's do that real fast
so first of all notice that n here this

1234
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,280
so first of all notice that n here this
 

1235
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,549
so first of all notice that n here this
n term doesn't depend

1236
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
n term doesn't depend
 

1237
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,230
n term doesn't depend
on the cement so i can just pull them

1238
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,240
on the cement so i can just pull them
 

1239
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,669
on the cement so i can just pull them
out right so this is really

1240
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
out right so this is really
 

1241
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,750
out right so this is really
this is the square root of n times the

1242
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
this is the square root of n times the
 

1243
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,870
this is the square root of n times the
sum over

1244
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
sum over
 

1245
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,310
sum over
l equals zero to the log two of

1246
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,320
l equals zero to the log two of
 

1247
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,310
l equals zero to the log two of
n of uh

1248
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
n of uh
 

1249
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,669
n of uh
what um

1250
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679

 

1251
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,149

oh and there's a mistake in my uh notes

1252
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
oh and there's a mistake in my uh notes
 

1253
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,789
oh and there's a mistake in my uh notes
oh man

1254
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799

 

1255
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,630

oh no this is oh all right duh

1256
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
oh no this is oh all right duh
 

1257
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,070
oh no this is oh all right duh
okay so you have 2 to the l and you have

1258
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
okay so you have 2 to the l and you have
 

1259
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,270
okay so you have 2 to the l and you have
a square root of 2 to the minus l

1260
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
a square root of 2 to the minus l
 

1261
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,190
a square root of 2 to the minus l
so this is really two to the minus l

1262
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
so this is really two to the minus l
 

1263
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,430
so this is really two to the minus l
over two

1264
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
over two
 

1265
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,070
over two
so you have l minus l over two and this

1266
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
so you have l minus l over two and this
 

1267
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,190
so you have l minus l over two and this
quantity is really

1268
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
quantity is really
 

1269
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,549
quantity is really
two to the l over two like that

1270
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
two to the l over two like that
 

1271
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,549
two to the l over two like that
does that make sense so this is just

1272
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
does that make sense so this is just
 

1273
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,470
does that make sense so this is just
properties of exponents from from high

1274
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
properties of exponents from from high
 

1275
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,990
properties of exponents from from high
school class

1276
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
school class
 

1277
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,950
school class
and in fact uh i don't like this because

1278
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
and in fact uh i don't like this because
 

1279
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,710
and in fact uh i don't like this because
l over 2 and i want to blindly apply a

1280
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
l over 2 and i want to blindly apply a
 

1281
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,789
l over 2 and i want to blindly apply a
formula without thinking about it

1282
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799
formula without thinking about it
 

1283
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,750
formula without thinking about it
and so of course this is really the same

1284
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:07,760
and so of course this is really the same
 

1285
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,710
and so of course this is really the same
as

1286
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
as
 

1287
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,909
as
the square root of 2 to the l power

1288
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919

 

1289
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,990

right it's just properties of exponents

1290
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
right it's just properties of exponents
 

1291
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,190
right it's just properties of exponents
okay so

1292
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
okay so
 

1293
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,510
okay so
what is this sum called do you recognize

1294
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
what is this sum called do you recognize
 

1295
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,029
what is this sum called do you recognize
this so there's some constant here

1296
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
this so there's some constant here
 

1297
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,310
this so there's some constant here
you're taking it to the elf power and

1298
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
you're taking it to the elf power and
 

1299
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,029
you're taking it to the elf power and
then you're summing it over else

1300
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039
then you're summing it over else
 

1301
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,669
then you're summing it over else
this is called a geometric series right

1302
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:27,679
this is called a geometric series right
 

1303
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,710
this is called a geometric series right
so it would be like

1304
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
so it would be like
 

1305
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,870
so it would be like
1 plus x plus x squared plus x to the

1306
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880
1 plus x plus x squared plus x to the
 

1307
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,310
1 plus x plus x squared plus x to the
third and

1308
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
third and
 

1309
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,390
third and
x to the i guess in this case log base 2

1310
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
x to the i guess in this case log base 2
 

1311
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,350
x to the i guess in this case log base 2
of n

1312
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
of n
 

1313
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,149
of n
yeah so uh conveniently there's a

1314
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
yeah so uh conveniently there's a
 

1315
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,390
yeah so uh conveniently there's a
geometric series formula out there

1316
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
geometric series formula out there
 

1317
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,230
geometric series formula out there
uh it's in i wrote it down in the uh the

1318
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
uh it's in i wrote it down in the uh the
 

1319
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,070
uh it's in i wrote it down in the uh the
handwritten notes but maybe uh for now

1320
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
handwritten notes but maybe uh for now
 

1321
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,510
handwritten notes but maybe uh for now
because i'm moving slowly as always so

1322
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
because i'm moving slowly as always so
 

1323
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,710
because i'm moving slowly as always so
we'll skip that part

1324
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:46,720
we'll skip that part
 

1325
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,310
we'll skip that part
uh and what you could um

1326
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
uh and what you could um
 

1327
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,630
uh and what you could um
is as follows that this is the square

1328
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:52,640
is as follows that this is the square
 

1329
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,430
is as follows that this is the square
root of n

1330
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
root of n
 

1331
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,830
root of n
right that's just this outer part times

1332
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
right that's just this outer part times
 

1333
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,029
right that's just this outer part times
uh

1334
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
uh
 

1335
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,630
uh
on the inside you're going to get the

1336
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
on the inside you're going to get the
 

1337
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,630
on the inside you're going to get the
square root of 2

1338
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
square root of 2
 

1339
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,990
square root of 2
to the log base 2 of n plus 1.

1340
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000

 

1341
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,190

uh minus one

1342
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200

 

1343
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,470

divided by the square root of two minus

1344
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
divided by the square root of two minus
 

1345
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,590
divided by the square root of two minus
one

1346
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
one
 

1347
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,029
one
and this is just the this is the

1348
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
and this is just the this is the
 

1349
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,870
and this is just the this is the
geometric series formula

1350
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
geometric series formula
 

1351
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,310
geometric series formula
so i encourage you guys to go back home

1352
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
so i encourage you guys to go back home
 

1353
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,070
so i encourage you guys to go back home
and google that one if you forgot yes

1354
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
and google that one if you forgot yes
 

1355
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,510
and google that one if you forgot yes
okay why are we doing why are we

1356
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
okay why are we doing why are we
 

1357
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,350
okay why are we doing why are we
calculating in some of the series

1358
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
calculating in some of the series
 

1359
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,549
calculating in some of the series
because what we're trying to do is

1360
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
because what we're trying to do is
 

1361
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,990
because what we're trying to do is
figure out the total amount of work in

1362
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
figure out the total amount of work in
 

1363
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,190
figure out the total amount of work in
this tree

1364
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
this tree
 

1365
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,149
this tree
right so what we've done so far we know

1366
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
right so what we've done so far we know
 

1367
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:32,549
right so what we've done so far we know
that

1368
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
that
 

1369
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,149
that
a single level in this tree is this

1370
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
a single level in this tree is this
 

1371
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,230
a single level in this tree is this
value and now we have to sum over all

1372
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,240
value and now we have to sum over all
 

1373
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,230
value and now we have to sum over all
the levels from zero to log base two of

1374
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
the levels from zero to log base two of
 

1375
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,549
the levels from zero to log base two of
n

1376
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
n
 

1377
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,310
n
okay and what is what do we use this

1378
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
okay and what is what do we use this
 

1379
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,310
okay and what is what do we use this
number for because we're trying to

1380
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
number for because we're trying to
 

1381
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,149
number for because we're trying to
actually approximate or at least bound t

1382
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
actually approximate or at least bound t
 

1383
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:44,950
actually approximate or at least bound t
of n

1384
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
of n
 

1385
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,789
of n
right and t of n is the sum of all these

1386
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
right and t of n is the sum of all these
 

1387
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,390
right and t of n is the sum of all these
values oh

1388
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
values oh
 

1389
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,310
values oh
okay and theta of n is not a sufficient

1390
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
okay and theta of n is not a sufficient
 

1391
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,470
okay and theta of n is not a sufficient
sound it is a sufficient bound we just

1392
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
sound it is a sufficient bound we just
 

1393
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,269
sound it is a sufficient bound we just
got it from

1394
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
got it from
 

1395
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,950
got it from
kind of a boring way this is a second

1396
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
kind of a boring way this is a second
 

1397
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,230
kind of a boring way this is a second
way that we could have proved the same

1398
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
way that we could have proved the same
 

1399
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,190
way that we could have proved the same
formula

1400
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
formula
 

1401
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,549
formula
yeah i see a question over here um

1402
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
yeah i see a question over here um
 

1403
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,190
yeah i see a question over here um
the root n two minus l part i understand

1404
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,200
the root n two minus l part i understand
 

1405
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,630
the root n two minus l part i understand
the num the two that l is the number of

1406
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640
the num the two that l is the number of
 

1407
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,590
the num the two that l is the number of
nodes

1408
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
nodes
 

1409
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,710
nodes
second part oh

1410
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
second part oh
 

1411
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,350
second part oh
okay this is the number of nodes this is

1412
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
okay this is the number of nodes this is
 

1413
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,789
okay this is the number of nodes this is
the quantity inside of the circle so

1414
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
the quantity inside of the circle so
 

1415
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,669
the quantity inside of the circle so
notice that it's

1416
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
notice that it's
 

1417
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,950
notice that it's
square root of n and then square root of

1418
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
square root of n and then square root of
 

1419
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,310
square root of n and then square root of
n over two and then square root of n

1420
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
n over two and then square root of n
 

1421
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,830
n over two and then square root of n
over four and then square root of n over

1422
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
over four and then square root of n over
 

1423
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,789
over four and then square root of n over
eight

1424
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
eight
 

1425
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,149
eight
right so two to the minus l here is like

1426
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:22,159
right so two to the minus l here is like
 

1427
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,830
right so two to the minus l here is like
you know one half and then one fourth

1428
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
you know one half and then one fourth
 

1429
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,390
you know one half and then one fourth
and then one eighth yeah

1430
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
and then one eighth yeah
 

1431
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,549
and then one eighth yeah
fabulous any other questions yes

1432
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559

 

1433
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,630

and we started indexing

1434
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640

 

1435
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,510

uh boy i hate my bad at this stuff uh

1436
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
uh boy i hate my bad at this stuff uh
 

1437
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,350
uh boy i hate my bad at this stuff uh
no right i think this is like this is

1438
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,360
no right i think this is like this is
 

1439
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,669
no right i think this is like this is
correct uh

1440
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
correct uh
 

1441
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,830
correct uh
let's see so let's say that i have uh n

1442
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
let's see so let's say that i have uh n
 

1443
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,750
let's see so let's say that i have uh n
equals two

1444
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
equals two
 

1445
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,269
equals two
right um then what's going to happen

1446
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279

 

1447
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,110

yeah no this is correct so so as a

1448
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,120
yeah no this is correct so so as a
 

1449
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,870
yeah no this is correct so so as a
sanity check uh think about n

1450
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
sanity check uh think about n
 

1451
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,110
sanity check uh think about n
equals two so how many levels should

1452
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
equals two so how many levels should
 

1453
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,630
equals two so how many levels should
there be it should go from l equals zero

1454
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
there be it should go from l equals zero
 

1455
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,909
there be it should go from l equals zero
and then l equals one

1456
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
and then l equals one
 

1457
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,630
and then l equals one
and then i'm done because i have t uh

1458
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
and then i'm done because i have t uh
 

1459
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,110
and then i'm done because i have t uh
and that i think

1460
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
and that i think
 

1461
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,990
and that i think
yeah so the log base two of of two is

1462
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
yeah so the log base two of of two is
 

1463
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,549
yeah so the log base two of of two is
one so

1464
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
one so
 

1465
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,590
one so
yeah so this this formula checks out

1466
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
yeah so this this formula checks out
 

1467
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,710
yeah so this this formula checks out
okay any other uh questions

1468
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
okay any other uh questions
 

1469
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,830
okay any other uh questions
these are all great questions you guys

1470
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
these are all great questions you guys
 

1471
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,070
these are all great questions you guys
are keeping me honest

1472
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
are keeping me honest
 

1473
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,870
are keeping me honest
okay so we have this giant ugly

1474
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
okay so we have this giant ugly
 

1475
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,230
okay so we have this giant ugly
expression here

1476
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
expression here
 

1477
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,390
expression here
uh and so our final job here is just to

1478
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
uh and so our final job here is just to
 

1479
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,510
uh and so our final job here is just to
simplify it that's it

1480
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,520
simplify it that's it
 

1481
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,870
simplify it that's it
uh and then and then what we're gonna

1482
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
uh and then and then what we're gonna
 

1483
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,950
uh and then and then what we're gonna
find is that this is secretly just theta

1484
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
find is that this is secretly just theta
 

1485
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,750
find is that this is secretly just theta
of n a little surprising given you know

1486
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
of n a little surprising given you know
 

1487
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,669
of n a little surprising given you know
that this is kind of ugly

1488
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
that this is kind of ugly
 

1489
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,830
that this is kind of ugly
okay and by the way this is just a

1490
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
okay and by the way this is just a
 

1491
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,669
okay and by the way this is just a
constant so this term on the denominator

1492
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
constant so this term on the denominator
 

1493
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,029
constant so this term on the denominator
is not going to end up mattering for

1494
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:43,039
is not going to end up mattering for
 

1495
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,430
is not going to end up mattering for
our asymptotic calculation okay

1496
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440

 

1497
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,669

cool so let's see here so remember that

1498
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
cool so let's see here so remember that
 

1499
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,110
cool so let's see here so remember that
the square root of two

1500
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
the square root of two
 

1501
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,310
the square root of two
is uh two to the one half yeah so i can

1502
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
is uh two to the one half yeah so i can
 

1503
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,510
is uh two to the one half yeah so i can
do a little bit of reshuffling on our

1504
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:57,520
do a little bit of reshuffling on our
 

1505
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,669
do a little bit of reshuffling on our
formula and and what i'm gonna find

1506
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679
formula and and what i'm gonna find
 

1507
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,990
formula and and what i'm gonna find
is that this is exactly the square root

1508
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
is that this is exactly the square root
 

1509
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,510
is that this is exactly the square root
of n

1510
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
of n
 

1511
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,470
of n
times one over the square root of 2

1512
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
times one over the square root of 2
 

1513
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,630
times one over the square root of 2
minus 1 that's just this constant here

1514
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,640
minus 1 that's just this constant here
 

1515
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,990
minus 1 that's just this constant here
now i just have to cope with this funny

1516
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
now i just have to cope with this funny
 

1517
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,470
now i just have to cope with this funny
term inside of here

1518
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
term inside of here
 

1519
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,590
term inside of here
i'm going to do the following i'm going

1520
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
i'm going to do the following i'm going
 

1521
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,669
i'm going to do the following i'm going
to say well 2

1522
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
to say well 2
 

1523
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,110
to say well 2
square root of 2 is the same as 2 to the

1524
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
square root of 2 is the same as 2 to the
 

1525
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,269
square root of 2 is the same as 2 to the
1 half so i'm going to write this

1526
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
1 half so i'm going to write this
 

1527
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,389
1 half so i'm going to write this
by moving that one half upstairs here

1528
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:22,399
by moving that one half upstairs here
 

1529
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,990
by moving that one half upstairs here
right so what am i going to get at the

1530
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,000
right so what am i going to get at the
 

1531
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,070
right so what am i going to get at the
end of the day is that this is the same

1532
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
end of the day is that this is the same
 

1533
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,190
end of the day is that this is the same
as

1534
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,200
as
 

1535
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,350
as
2 to the log base 2

1536
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360

 

1537
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,549

of n plus one

1538
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
of n plus one
 

1539
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,350
of n plus one
and all of that uh oops plus one half

1540
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
and all of that uh oops plus one half
 

1541
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,470
and all of that uh oops plus one half
right because there's a one-half

1542
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:38,480
right because there's a one-half
 

1543
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,710
right because there's a one-half
exponent that got multiplied by the one

1544
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
exponent that got multiplied by the one
 

1545
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,669
exponent that got multiplied by the one
uh minus one all right so this is just

1546
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
uh minus one all right so this is just
 

1547
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,269
uh minus one all right so this is just
an identical expression to this one all

1548
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:45,279
an identical expression to this one all
 

1549
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,590
an identical expression to this one all
i've done is move the one-half upstairs

1550
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,600
i've done is move the one-half upstairs
 

1551
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,990
i've done is move the one-half upstairs
and finally now there's some order in

1552
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
and finally now there's some order in
 

1553
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,510
and finally now there's some order in
the universe right because what is 2 to

1554
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
the universe right because what is 2 to
 

1555
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,029
the universe right because what is 2 to
the log base 2 of n

1556
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:57,039

 

1557
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,909

n exactly very complicated way of

1558
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
n exactly very complicated way of
 

1559
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,789
n exactly very complicated way of
writing n

1560
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:00,799
writing n
 

1561
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,149
writing n
so this is equal to the square root of n

1562
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:04,159
so this is equal to the square root of n
 

1563
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,029
so this is equal to the square root of n
times 1 over the square root of 2 minus

1564
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
times 1 over the square root of 2 minus
 

1565
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,870
times 1 over the square root of 2 minus
1 which is just a constant

1566
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:08,880
1 which is just a constant
 

1567
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,470
1 which is just a constant
i see your hand i'm going to write and

1568
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:10,480
i see your hand i'm going to write and
 

1569
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,990
i see your hand i'm going to write and
and then i'll catch up with you

1570
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
and then i'll catch up with you
 

1571
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,549
and then i'll catch up with you
and now this whole quantity is n times

1572
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:14,559
and now this whole quantity is n times
 

1573
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,830
and now this whole quantity is n times
the square root of two

1574
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
the square root of two
 

1575
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,950
the square root of two
right oops

1576
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:18,960
right oops
 

1577
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,870
right oops
wait

1578
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880

 

1579
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,990

um oh i'm sorry

1580
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
um oh i'm sorry
 

1581
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,389
um oh i'm sorry
that should be right because we moved uh

1582
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:28,399
that should be right because we moved uh
 

1583
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,909
that should be right because we moved uh
we moved the one-half into the exponent

1584
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:29,919
we moved the one-half into the exponent
 

1585
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,830
we moved the one-half into the exponent
i didn't account for it

1586
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
i didn't account for it
 

1587
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,190
i didn't account for it
so this is the square root of n uh

1588
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
so this is the square root of n uh
 

1589
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,110
so this is the square root of n uh
multiplied by the square root of two um

1590
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
multiplied by the square root of two um
 

1591
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,230
multiplied by the square root of two um
what's that

1592
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
what's that
 

1593
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,630
what's that
n over 2 times the square root no i

1594
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
n over 2 times the square root no i
 

1595
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,590
n over 2 times the square root no i
think this is right

1596
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:47,600
think this is right
 

1597
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,590
think this is right
yeah it doesn't make me nervous

1598
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
yeah it doesn't make me nervous
 

1599
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,909
yeah it doesn't make me nervous
okay so finally now we can start to see

1600
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919
okay so finally now we can start to see
 

1601
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,350
okay so finally now we can start to see
the big o come out right because now we

1602
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
the big o come out right because now we
 

1603
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,470
the big o come out right because now we
have the square root of n

1604
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
have the square root of n
 

1605
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,110
have the square root of n
times itself plus some other stuff which

1606
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
times itself plus some other stuff which
 

1607
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,870
times itself plus some other stuff which
is obviously going to grow slower than

1608
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880
is obviously going to grow slower than
 

1609
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,770
is obviously going to grow slower than
the remaining terms here so we're good

1610
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:03,780
the remaining terms here so we're good
 

1611
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,230
the remaining terms here so we're good
[Applause]

1612
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
[Applause]

you get to the expression you want so
now you can see why master theory maybe

1638
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
now you can see why master theory maybe
 

1639
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,870
now you can see why master theory maybe
is kind of valuable because it saves you

1640
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
is kind of valuable because it saves you

a lot of headache yes um when we write

1642
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
a lot of headache yes um when we write
 

1643
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,950
a lot of headache yes um when we write
up our presets and we have to write up

1644
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
up our presets and we have to write up
 

1645
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,950
up our presets and we have to write up
trees like this

1646
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
trees like this
 

1647
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,789
trees like this
and take pictures yeah i don't see why

1648
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
and take pictures yeah i don't see why
 

1649
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,710
and take pictures yeah i don't see why
not it's uh they don't have to like draw

1650
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
not it's uh they don't have to like draw
 

1651
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,230
not it's uh they don't have to like draw
it in dixie or something

1652
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,240
it in dixie or something
 

1653
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,230
it in dixie or something
oh you can take pictures of diagram

1654
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
oh you can take pictures of diagram
 

1655
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,430
oh you can take pictures of diagram
songs the math doesn't

1656
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
songs the math doesn't
 

1657
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,190
songs the math doesn't
take yeah i think i think if you're like

1658
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
take yeah i think i think if you're like
 

1659
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,630
take yeah i think i think if you're like
just writing out your math

1660
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
just writing out your math
 

1661
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,710
just writing out your math
taking a photo of it and then like

1662
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
taking a photo of it and then like
 

1663
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,630
taking a photo of it and then like
backslash include graphics of your photo

1664
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
backslash include graphics of your photo
 

1665
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,830
backslash include graphics of your photo
yeah but just for the figure i think

1666
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,840
yeah but just for the figure i think
 

1667
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,830
yeah but just for the figure i think
that's

1668
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:53,840
that's
 

1669
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,350
that's
yeah like when i write research papers

1670
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
yeah like when i write research papers
 

1671
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,269
yeah like when i write research papers
that's how i do it until the final draft

1672
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:57,279
that's how i do it until the final draft
 

1673
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,909
that's how i do it until the final draft
yeah okay so essentially what do we just

1674
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
yeah okay so essentially what do we just
 

1675
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,669
yeah okay so essentially what do we just
do in this problem which is part a of

1676
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
do in this problem which is part a of
 

1677
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,630
do in this problem which is part a of
one problem

1678
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:02,640
one problem
 

1679
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,710
one problem
uh is essentially just show two

1680
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
uh is essentially just show two
 

1681
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,470
uh is essentially just show two
different ways of solving a recurrence

1682
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
different ways of solving a recurrence
 

1683
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,990
different ways of solving a recurrence
right one is the sledgehammer

1684
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
right one is the sledgehammer
 

1685
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,510
right one is the sledgehammer
that's very efficient but not terribly

1686
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
that's very efficient but not terribly
 

1687
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,430
that's very efficient but not terribly
illustrative the other is really working

1688
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:11,440
illustrative the other is really working
 

1689
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,870
illustrative the other is really working
out all of the work that happens at

1690
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
out all of the work that happens at
 

1691
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,230
out all of the work that happens at
every level of our tree

1692
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
every level of our tree
 

1693
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,389
every level of our tree
doing a giant sum and then and just

1694
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
doing a giant sum and then and just
 

1695
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,470
doing a giant sum and then and just
actually deriving the the proper formula

1696
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
actually deriving the the proper formula
 

1697
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,669
actually deriving the the proper formula
and both of these are just different

1698
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
and both of these are just different
 

1699
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,669
and both of these are just different
ways to skin the same cat is that a

1700
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
ways to skin the same cat is that a
 

1701
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,950
ways to skin the same cat is that a
weird phrase

1702
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
weird phrase
 

1703
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,149
weird phrase
i don't know okay so uh

1704
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159
i don't know okay so uh
 

1705
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,190
i don't know okay so uh
right so actually uh part two i believe

1706
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
right so actually uh part two i believe
 

1707
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,070
right so actually uh part two i believe
ends up being easier by a funny fluke

1708
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,080
ends up being easier by a funny fluke
 

1709
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,669
ends up being easier by a funny fluke
even though it looks like it's harder

1710
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
even though it looks like it's harder
 

1711
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,230
even though it looks like it's harder
uh so so let's do that uh next here so

1712
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
uh so so let's do that uh next here so
 

1713
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,149
uh so so let's do that uh next here so
i'm going to leave master theorem

1714
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
i'm going to leave master theorem
 

1715
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,590
i'm going to leave master theorem
on the left-hand side i really want to

1716
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:39,600
on the left-hand side i really want to
 

1717
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,029
on the left-hand side i really want to
say master's theorem but i guess that's

1718
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
say master's theorem but i guess that's
 

1719
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,710
say master's theorem but i guess that's
not right i'm going to leave the master

1720
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
not right i'm going to leave the master
 

1721
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,190
not right i'm going to leave the master
theorem

1722
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
theorem
 

1723
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,510
theorem
on the left-hand side

1724
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520

 

1725
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,350

and just do the problem over here

1726
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,360

 

1727
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,549

i'm gonna do this one a little bit

1728
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
i'm gonna do this one a little bit
 

1729
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,990
i'm gonna do this one a little bit
quicker because i prefer not to spend

1730
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
quicker because i prefer not to spend
 

1731
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,909
quicker because i prefer not to spend
the whole session on one problem

1732
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:57,919
the whole session on one problem
 

1733
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,149
the whole session on one problem
okay but i do think it's worth spending

1734
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
okay but i do think it's worth spending
 

1735
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,590
okay but i do think it's worth spending
a few minutes going over this theorem

1736
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:01,600
a few minutes going over this theorem
 

1737
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,029
a few minutes going over this theorem
and how to apply it carefully because

1738
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
and how to apply it carefully because
 

1739
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:16,149
and how to apply it carefully because
well otherwise you won't okay

1740
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159

 

1741
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,520

all right folks it's a workout up here

1742
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:20,530
all right folks it's a workout up here
 

1743
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,070
all right folks it's a workout up here
[Applause]

1744
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,080

 

1745
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,269

so in part b uh we have a version

1746
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
so in part b uh we have a version
 

1747
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,950
so in part b uh we have a version
where the branching factor and the

1748
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:28,960
where the branching factor and the
 

1749
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,470
where the branching factor and the
amount of the work reduce

1750
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480
amount of the work reduce
 

1751
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,029
amount of the work reduce
uh reduces or not the same so now we

1752
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
uh reduces or not the same so now we
 

1753
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,789
uh reduces or not the same so now we
have to be a little bit more careful

1754
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
have to be a little bit more careful
 

1755
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,230
have to be a little bit more careful
in the way that we apply master theory

1756
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
in the way that we apply master theory
 

1757
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,830
in the way that we apply master theory
right so now in part

1758
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
right so now in part
 

1759
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,350
right so now in part
uh b we have that t

1760
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
uh b we have that t
 

1761
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,310
uh b we have that t
of uh n here is equal to

1762
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
of uh n here is equal to
 

1763
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,610
of uh n here is equal to
eight t of n over four

1764
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:49,620
eight t of n over four
 

1765
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,509
eight t of n over four
[Applause]

1766
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
[Applause]
 

1767
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,870
[Applause]
plus and now in the problem they write

1768
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
plus and now in the problem they write
 

1769
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,830
plus and now in the problem they write
big o of n

1770
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:55,840
big o of n
 

1771
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,149
big o of n
times the square root of n we're all

1772
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:58,159
times the square root of n we're all
 

1773
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,509
times the square root of n we're all
grown ups here that's the same as big o

1774
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:01,519
grown ups here that's the same as big o
 

1775
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,549
grown ups here that's the same as big o
of n to the three

1776
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
of n to the three
 

1777
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,310
of n to the three
halves yeah that's this arithmetic

1778
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
halves yeah that's this arithmetic
 

1779
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,470
halves yeah that's this arithmetic
okay so first let's apply the uh the

1780
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
okay so first let's apply the uh the
 

1781
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,549
okay so first let's apply the uh the
master's theorem so uh

1782
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
master's theorem so uh
 

1783
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,669
master's theorem so uh
let's see so what is n to the log base b

1784
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
let's see so what is n to the log base b
 

1785
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,110
let's see so what is n to the log base b
of a in this case well

1786
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,120
of a in this case well
 

1787
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,029
of a in this case well
what is uh b four

1788
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,039

 

1789
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,430

what is a eight

1790
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
what is a eight
 

1791
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,230
what is a eight
anybody know log base four of eight

1792
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,240
anybody know log base four of eight
 

1793
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,590
anybody know log base four of eight
through wow you're good

1794
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
through wow you're good
 

1795
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,789
through wow you're good
yeah so this is equal to n to the three

1796
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:36,799
yeah so this is equal to n to the three
 

1797
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,310
yeah so this is equal to n to the three
house and notice that these two things

1798
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
house and notice that these two things
 

1799
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,990
house and notice that these two things
agree now

1800
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
agree now
 

1801
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,350
agree now
yeah so which of the three cases of

1802
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
yeah so which of the three cases of
 

1803
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,430
yeah so which of the three cases of
master's theorem are we in the master

1804
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,440
master's theorem are we in the master
 

1805
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,750
master's theorem are we in the master
theorem are we in

1806
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
theorem are we in
 

1807
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,430
theorem are we in
are we in the first one where like one

1808
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,440
are we in the first one where like one
 

1809
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,549
are we in the first one where like one
of these kind of dwarfs the other

1810
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:50,559
of these kind of dwarfs the other
 

1811
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,310
of these kind of dwarfs the other
no we're in case two right where they

1812
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
no we're in case two right where they
 

1813
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,789
no we're in case two right where they
both kind of behave similarly

1814
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
both kind of behave similarly
 

1815
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,710
both kind of behave similarly
yeah so this is case two

1816
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:00,720

 

1817
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,110

and what is the value of k uh for case

1818
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,120
and what is the value of k uh for case
 

1819
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,389
and what is the value of k uh for case
two that's relevant here

1820
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
two that's relevant here
 

1821
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,350
two that's relevant here
do i need a log factor no these two

1822
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
do i need a log factor no these two
 

1823
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,310
do i need a log factor no these two
terms are just the same

1824
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
terms are just the same
 

1825
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,990
terms are just the same
right they're both n to the three halves

1826
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,000
right they're both n to the three halves
 

1827
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,230
right they're both n to the three halves
so this is case two with k

1828
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240
so this is case two with k
 

1829
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,149
so this is case two with k
equals zero yeah and in particular

1830
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
equals zero yeah and in particular
 

1831
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,470
equals zero yeah and in particular
immediately we get that t of n

1832
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480

 

1833
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,509

is uh let's see we're in case two so we

1834
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:25,519
is uh let's see we're in case two so we
 

1835
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,710
is uh let's see we're in case two so we
have

1836
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:26,720
have
 

1837
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,149
have
theta of n to the log base b of a

1838
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159

 

1839
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,710

times log to the k plus one of n so you

1840
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,720
times log to the k plus one of n so you
 

1841
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,950
times log to the k plus one of n so you
have to account for that term so it's

1842
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
have to account for that term so it's
 

1843
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,430
have to account for that term so it's
like that that makes sense how we apply

1844
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:41,440
like that that makes sense how we apply
 

1845
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,350
like that that makes sense how we apply
to master theorem in that case

1846
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,360
to master theorem in that case
 

1847
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,830
to master theorem in that case
yes so how do we apply case two of this

1848
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
yes so how do we apply case two of this
 

1849
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,590
yes so how do we apply case two of this
video

1850
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
video
 

1851
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,630
video
how can we apply case two

1852
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640
how can we apply case two
 

1853
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,110
how can we apply case two
if f n is big o and not big theta

1854
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
if f n is big o and not big theta
 

1855
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,630
if f n is big o and not big theta
well this is coming from a grad student

1856
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:56,640
well this is coming from a grad student
 

1857
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,990
well this is coming from a grad student
so why don't i ping it back to the to

1858
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
so why don't i ping it back to the to
 

1859
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,310
so why don't i ping it back to the to
the

1860
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
the
 

1861
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,430
the
the students in the class rather than

00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
the students in the class rather than

answering myself can you read the

1864
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
answering myself can you read the
 

1865
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,470
answering myself can you read the
question

1866
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,480
question
 

1867
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,230
question
sure so let's say that we just have a

1868
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
sure so let's say that we just have a
 

1869
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,710
sure so let's say that we just have a
big o we don't have a big theta here

1870
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:10,720

 

1871
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,149

or is this at least a simple answer

1872
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:12,159
or is this at least a simple answer
 

1873
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,030
or is this at least a simple answer
which maybe is the one that you're

1874
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
which maybe is the one that you're
 

1875
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,950
which maybe is the one that you're
looking for

1876
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
looking for
 

1877
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,470
looking for
so what do we know in that case we know

1878
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
so what do we know in that case we know
 

1879
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,629
so what do we know in that case we know
that f n might grow more slowly than

1880
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
that f n might grow more slowly than
 

1881
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,750
that f n might grow more slowly than
this function but it doesn't grow more

1882
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:19,760
this function but it doesn't grow more
 

1883
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,950
this function but it doesn't grow more
quickly than this thing

1884
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:20,960
quickly than this thing
 

1885
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,030
quickly than this thing
yeah would you ever just be big o

1886
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
yeah would you ever just be big o
 

1887
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,470
yeah would you ever just be big o
instead of b that's exactly right so you

1888
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
instead of b that's exactly right so you
 

1889
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,230
instead of b that's exactly right so you
can just replace big theta with big o

1890
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,240
can just replace big theta with big o
 

1891
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,750
can just replace big theta with big o
and that's perfectly fine

1892
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:27,760
and that's perfectly fine
 

1893
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,869
and that's perfectly fine
so i don't know if that's the answer

1894
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:28,879
so i don't know if that's the answer
 

1895
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,790
so i don't know if that's the answer
you're looking for but it's a at least

1896
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:30,800
you're looking for but it's a at least
 

1897
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,710
you're looking for but it's a at least
you get a loose bound this way yeah

1898
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
you get a loose bound this way yeah
 

1899
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,230
you get a loose bound this way yeah
oops oh i'm sorry that's i i see we're

1900
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:38,240
oops oh i'm sorry that's i i see we're
 

1901
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,629
oops oh i'm sorry that's i i see we're
being

1902
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
being
 

1903
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,589
being
pedantic okay you can just tell me if i

1904
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:41,599
pedantic okay you can just tell me if i
 

1905
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,869
pedantic okay you can just tell me if i
made a mistake

1906
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879
made a mistake
 

1907
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,629
made a mistake
it happens i think it's correct in my

1908
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
it happens i think it's correct in my
 

1909
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,069
it happens i think it's correct in my
notes it is

1910
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
notes it is
 

1911
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,310
notes it is
okay so the reason our colleague brings

1912
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,320
okay so the reason our colleague brings
 

1913
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,430
okay so the reason our colleague brings
it up in the back is that i made a

1914
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:49,440
it up in the back is that i made a
 

1915
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,950
it up in the back is that i made a
slight mistake which is that this is a

1916
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:50,960
slight mistake which is that this is a
 

1917
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,909
slight mistake which is that this is a
big o

1918
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
big o
 

1919
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,349
big o
not a big theta right in which case the

1920
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359
not a big theta right in which case the
 

1921
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,550
not a big theta right in which case the
only thing i can draw

1922
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
only thing i can draw
 

1923
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,390
only thing i can draw
uh down here is that this is also a big

1924
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400
uh down here is that this is also a big
 

1925
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,150
uh down here is that this is also a big
o so i made exactly the mistake i told

1926
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160
o so i made exactly the mistake i told
 

1927
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,390
o so i made exactly the mistake i told
you guys to avoid before

1928
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
you guys to avoid before
 

1929
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,150
you guys to avoid before
yes so then over there

1930
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,160
yes so then over there
 

1931
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,349
yes so then over there
those also be videos uh no yeah now i've

1932
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
those also be videos uh no yeah now i've
 

1933
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,630
those also be videos uh no yeah now i've
managed to confuse you all

1934
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
managed to confuse you all
 

1935
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,030
managed to confuse you all
this is correct this entire statement of

1936
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
this is correct this entire statement of
 

1937
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,390
this is correct this entire statement of
the master theory i'm assuming i copied

1938
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
the master theory i'm assuming i copied
 

1939
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,030
the master theory i'm assuming i copied
it correctly

1940
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,040
it correctly
 

1941
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,349
it correctly
is is right but there's a bit of a

1942
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
is is right but there's a bit of a
 

1943
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,790
is is right but there's a bit of a
difference remember we wanted to apply

1944
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:18,800
difference remember we wanted to apply
 

1945
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,230
difference remember we wanted to apply
case two

1946
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,240
case two
 

1947
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,230
case two
and look at case two so there's a theta

1948
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
and look at case two so there's a theta
 

1949
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,670
and look at case two so there's a theta
here

1950
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
here
 

1951
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,109
here
but in the problem in the homework

1952
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:25,119
but in the problem in the homework
 

1953
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,870
but in the problem in the homework
problem they were sneaky

1954
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
problem they were sneaky
 

1955
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,030
problem they were sneaky
and they only said that f of t is big o

1956
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,040
and they only said that f of t is big o
 

1957
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,470
and they only said that f of t is big o
of something so remember the

1958
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
of something so remember the
 

1959
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,589
of something so remember the
what's what's the difference between big

1960
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
what's what's the difference between big
 

1961
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,150
what's what's the difference between big
o and big theta

1962
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,160
o and big theta
 

1963
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,310
o and big theta
well intuitively big theta says that my

1964
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,320
well intuitively big theta says that my
 

1965
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,910
well intuitively big theta says that my
function really does look like this guy

1966
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
function really does look like this guy
 

1967
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,270
function really does look like this guy
that like somehow bounded above and

1968
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,280
that like somehow bounded above and
 

1969
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,829
that like somehow bounded above and
below

1970
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:39,839
below
 

1971
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,270
below
yeah as i go far enough out in big o

1972
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,280
yeah as i go far enough out in big o
 

1973
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,589
yeah as i go far enough out in big o
there's just a bound above right so this

1974
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
there's just a bound above right so this
 

1975
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,270
there's just a bound above right so this
is somehow looser

1976
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,280
is somehow looser
 

1977
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,030
is somehow looser
and so the way to apply massive theorem

1978
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
and so the way to apply massive theorem
 

1979
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,390
and so the way to apply massive theorem
in this case is say well at least f

1980
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,400
in this case is say well at least f
 

1981
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,230
in this case is say well at least f
n is upper bounded i think it looks like

1982
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,240
n is upper bounded i think it looks like
 

1983
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,510
n is upper bounded i think it looks like
this so the best that i can do

1984
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:53,520
this so the best that i can do
 

1985
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,030
this so the best that i can do
is to replace this guy also with an

1986
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
is to replace this guy also with an
 

1987
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,270
is to replace this guy also with an
upper bound yeah it's a great question

1988
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
upper bound yeah it's a great question
 

1989
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,630
upper bound yeah it's a great question
so the reason you chose to use that one

1990
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640

 

1991
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,069

exactly you got to kind of stand back

1992
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:04,079
exactly you got to kind of stand back
 

1993
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,589
exactly you got to kind of stand back
and squint out it a little bit make sure

1994
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:05,599
and squint out it a little bit make sure
 

1995
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,470
and squint out it a little bit make sure
that it fits

1996
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
that it fits
 

1997
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,750
that it fits
but certainly it's the case that the

1998
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
but certainly it's the case that the
 

1999
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,990
but certainly it's the case that the
other two parts of this theorem don't

2000
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
other two parts of this theorem don't
 

2001
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,270
other two parts of this theorem don't
apply

2002
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
apply
 

2003
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,550
apply
we might as well try to squeeze this

2004
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
we might as well try to squeeze this
 

2005
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,470
we might as well try to squeeze this
part into the right floor

2006
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
part into the right floor
 

2007
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,030
part into the right floor
all right um

2008
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,040

 

2009
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,790

so let's uh let's do the tree version of

2010
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
so let's uh let's do the tree version of
 

2011
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,829
so let's uh let's do the tree version of
this and then i think what we're going

2012
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:21,839
this and then i think what we're going
 

2013
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,750
this and then i think what we're going
to do is skip part three for now of this

2014
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:23,760
to do is skip part three for now of this
 

2015
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,510
to do is skip part three for now of this
problem because it's mostly like a fun

2016
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,520
problem because it's mostly like a fun
 

2017
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,790
problem because it's mostly like a fun
combinatorial problem rather than

2018
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:26,800
combinatorial problem rather than
 

2019
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,910
combinatorial problem rather than
something that like actually is going to

2020
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
something that like actually is going to
 

2021
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,349
something that like actually is going to
help your understanding of algorithms

2022
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:29,359
help your understanding of algorithms
 

2023
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,390
help your understanding of algorithms
and then if we have time at the end

2024
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
and then if we have time at the end
 

2025
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,030
and then if we have time at the end
we'll come back to it okay

2026
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,040
we'll come back to it okay
 

2027
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,270
we'll come back to it okay
all right so that was the easy way to

2028
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
all right so that was the easy way to
 

2029
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,310
all right so that was the easy way to
solve the problem now let's do the

2030
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320
solve the problem now let's do the
 

2031
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,950
solve the problem now let's do the
painful one

2032
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
painful one
 

2033
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,630
painful one
where we uh we draw the tree i shouldn't

2034
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:38,640
where we uh we draw the tree i shouldn't
 

2035
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,829
where we uh we draw the tree i shouldn't
say that because i think it's the one we

2036
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
say that because i think it's the one we
 

2037
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,630
say that because i think it's the one we
want to encourage

2038
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:40,640
want to encourage
 

2039
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,990
want to encourage
the more enlightening version yeah um

2040
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000
the more enlightening version yeah um
 

2041
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,190
the more enlightening version yeah um
so now at the top of my tree i do and

2042
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,200
so now at the top of my tree i do and
 

2043
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,030
so now at the top of my tree i do and
to the three halves work

2044
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
to the three halves work
 

2045
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,270
to the three halves work
and now how many children does this guy

2046
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,280
and now how many children does this guy
 

2047
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,510
and now how many children does this guy
have

2048
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
have
 

2049
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,270
have
careful do you kind of yeah one in two

2050
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280
careful do you kind of yeah one in two
 

2051
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,710
careful do you kind of yeah one in two
chances either eight or four

2052
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720

 

2053
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,510

eight right so the outer coefficient is

2054
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:03,520
eight right so the outer coefficient is
 

2055
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,470
eight right so the outer coefficient is
the number of children because that's

2056
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:04,480
the number of children because that's
 

2057
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,670
the number of children because that's
like the number of function calls you

2058
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
like the number of function calls you
 

2059
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,870
like the number of function calls you
make right that's the way to think about

2060
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
make right that's the way to think about
 

2061
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,750
make right that's the way to think about
it right so there's eight

2062
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:09,760
it right so there's eight
 

2063
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,950
it right so there's eight
of these guys

2064
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:14,960

 

2065
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,270

okay and each one of these guys i'm only

2066
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
okay and each one of these guys i'm only
 

2067
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,790
okay and each one of these guys i'm only
going to do one level of these

2068
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
going to do one level of these
 

2069
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,030
going to do one level of these
by the way that should not be connected

2070
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
by the way that should not be connected
 

2071
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,790
by the way that should not be connected
uh does how much work well remember that

2072
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
uh does how much work well remember that
 

2073
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,910
uh does how much work well remember that
it's divided by four

2074
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,920
it's divided by four
 

2075
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,550
it's divided by four
here right so it looks like n over four

2076
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:26,560
here right so it looks like n over four
 

2077
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:34,550
here right so it looks like n over four
to the three halves

2078
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,560

 

2079
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,069

that makes sense how we kind of got this

2080
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:36,079
that makes sense how we kind of got this
 

2081
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,030
that makes sense how we kind of got this
picture from from uh our recurrence

2082
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,040
picture from from uh our recurrence
 

2083
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,670
picture from from uh our recurrence
let's switch to another piece chat okay

2084
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
let's switch to another piece chat okay
 

2085
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,950
let's switch to another piece chat okay
so uh

2086
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:42,960
so uh
 

2087
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,750
so uh
right so in other words uh

2088
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:47,760

 

2089
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,829

if i look at level l of my tree assuming

2090
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:49,839
if i look at level l of my tree assuming
 

2091
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,030
if i look at level l of my tree assuming
we're going to index from zero at the

2092
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,040
we're going to index from zero at the
 

2093
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,750
we're going to index from zero at the
top

2094
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760
top
 

2095
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,829
top
how many nodes are in level l

2096
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:55,839

 

2097
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,710

remember it branches by eight each time

2098
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:58,720
remember it branches by eight each time
 

2099
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,950
remember it branches by eight each time
so it has

2100
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
so it has
 

2101
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,510
so it has
eight to the l nodes

2102
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
eight to the l nodes
 

2103
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,430
eight to the l nodes
yeah and uh how much

2104
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
yeah and uh how much
 

2105
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:18,390
yeah and uh how much
work does each do

2106
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:18,400
work does each do
 

2107
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,150
work does each do
well in each level i divide by four

2108
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,160
well in each level i divide by four
 

2109
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,550
well in each level i divide by four
right so it's gonna look like n times

2110
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
right so it's gonna look like n times
 

2111
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,349
right so it's gonna look like n times
one fourth

2112
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:25,359
one fourth
 

2113
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,790
one fourth
to the l to the three halves

2114
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:28,800
to the l to the three halves
 

2115
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,710
to the l to the three halves
right um

2116
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
right um
 

2117
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,550
right um
right where am i uh

2118
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:36,560
right where am i uh
 

2119
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,750
right where am i uh
there we are so that's n

2120
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:39,760
there we are so that's n
 

2121
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,230
there we are so that's n
times four the minus l that's fancy

2122
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,240
times four the minus l that's fancy
 

2123
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,990
times four the minus l that's fancy
notation for one fourth to the l

2124
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,000
notation for one fourth to the l
 

2125
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,190
notation for one fourth to the l
uh to the three halves

2126
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:47,200
uh to the three halves
 

2127
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,550
uh to the three halves
notice that this is exactly the same

2128
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,560
notice that this is exactly the same
 

2129
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,310
notice that this is exactly the same
pattern as the previous problem i'm just

2130
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,320
pattern as the previous problem i'm just
 

2131
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,270
pattern as the previous problem i'm just
plugging in some different some

2132
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
plugging in some different some
 

2133
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,030
plugging in some different some
different constants

2134
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,040
different constants
 

2135
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,030
different constants
yes the question of the diagram is if

2136
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,040
yes the question of the diagram is if
 

2137
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,710
yes the question of the diagram is if
you had like a really

2138
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:56,720
you had like a really
 

2139
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,109
you had like a really
large a um and you're trying to do the

2140
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119
large a um and you're trying to do the
 

2141
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,790
large a um and you're trying to do the
recovery tree method is that

2142
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
recovery tree method is that
 

2143
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,589
recovery tree method is that
this type of um work okay like where you

2144
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
this type of um work okay like where you
 

2145
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,190
this type of um work okay like where you
have like if i were grading your papers

2146
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
have like if i were grading your papers
 

2147
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,150
have like if i were grading your papers
it would be but i

2148
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,160
it would be but i
 

2149
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,670
it would be but i
you should probably check with your tas

2150
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,680
you should probably check with your tas
 

2151
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,349
you should probably check with your tas
on piazza on that one

2152
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
on piazza on that one
 

2153
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,790
on piazza on that one
um but you know i've learned my license

2154
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:12,800
um but you know i've learned my license
 

2155
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,390
um but you know i've learned my license
uh you know i'm not sure you guys have

2156
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:14,400
uh you know i'm not sure you guys have
 

2157
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,670
uh you know i'm not sure you guys have
yet and also i'm not sure i have either

2158
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:17,680
yet and also i'm not sure i have either
 

2159
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,550
yet and also i'm not sure i have either
all right folks so now we need to do our

2160
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
all right folks so now we need to do our
 

2161
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,910
all right folks so now we need to do our
our total amount of work here

2162
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920
our total amount of work here
 

2163
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,030
our total amount of work here
right so how many uh how many levels are

2164
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,040
right so how many uh how many levels are
 

2165
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,069
right so how many uh how many levels are
there in our tree

2166
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
there in our tree
 

2167
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,310
there in our tree
here well the amount of data divides by

2168
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:28,320
here well the amount of data divides by
 

2169
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,829
here well the amount of data divides by
four each time

2170
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:29,839
four each time
 

2171
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,950
four each time
and when the amount of data is one then

2172
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:32,960
and when the amount of data is one then
 

2173
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,670
and when the amount of data is one then
i'm done

2174
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
i'm done
 

2175
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,790
i'm done
right so the total number of levels

2176
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800

 

2177
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,550

is equal to the log base 4 of n

2178
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:42,560
is equal to the log base 4 of n
 

2179
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,069
is equal to the log base 4 of n
the basic thing to get right in in this

2180
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:44,079
the basic thing to get right in in this
 

2181
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,190
the basic thing to get right in in this
problem is just where there should be

2182
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
problem is just where there should be
 

2183
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,349
problem is just where there should be
fours and where there should be eights

2184
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359
fours and where there should be eights
 

2185
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,550
fours and where there should be eights
okay so now uh what am i going to do

2186
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,560
okay so now uh what am i going to do
 

2187
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,390
okay so now uh what am i going to do
well again as our colleague in the back

2188
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:52,400
well again as our colleague in the back
 

2189
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,150
well again as our colleague in the back
points out we only have big o

2190
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,160
points out we only have big o
 

2191
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,950
points out we only have big o
so we can only upper bound our work but

2192
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960
so we can only upper bound our work but
 

2193
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,230
so we can only upper bound our work but
our work in the tree

2194
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,240

 

2195
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,430

is less than or equal to um

2196
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
is less than or equal to um
 

2197
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,950
is less than or equal to um
really there's a proportion here because

2198
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
really there's a proportion here because
 

2199
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,630
really there's a proportion here because
this is just up to a multiple i guess

2200
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
this is just up to a multiple i guess
 

2201
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,750
this is just up to a multiple i guess
that's why in the notes they put a

2202
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:07,760
that's why in the notes they put a
 

2203
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,190
that's why in the notes they put a
little c in front

2204
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,200
little c in front
 

2205
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,230
little c in front
um which i can do let's do

2206
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,240
um which i can do let's do
 

2207
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,950
um which i can do let's do
c like that uh well we're going to have

2208
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960
c like that uh well we're going to have
 

2209
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,750
c like that uh well we're going to have
the sum

2210
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:15,760
the sum
 

2211
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,589
the sum
from l equals 0 to log base 4

2212
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
from l equals 0 to log base 4
 

2213
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,150
from l equals 0 to log base 4
of n of exactly the quantity uh

2214
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
of n of exactly the quantity uh
 

2215
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,150
of n of exactly the quantity uh
this this guy multiplied by the number

2216
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,160
this this guy multiplied by the number
 

2217
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,750
this this guy multiplied by the number
of of nodes in the rail

2218
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
of of nodes in the rail
 

2219
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,710
of of nodes in the rail
yes is the reason why we made this work

2220
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
yes is the reason why we made this work
 

2221
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,829
yes is the reason why we made this work
the inequality

2222
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:31,839
the inequality
 

2223
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,390
the inequality
because of the because of the big o

2224
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
because of the because of the big o
 

2225
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,589
because of the because of the big o
that's exactly right

2226
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
that's exactly right
 

2227
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,990
that's exactly right
yeah okay all right so what do i uh

2228
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
yeah okay all right so what do i uh
 

2229
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,630
yeah okay all right so what do i uh
get here well let's write it out the big

2230
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:42,640
get here well let's write it out the big
 

2231
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,309
get here well let's write it out the big
ugly way first so this is

2232
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:44,319
ugly way first so this is
 

2233
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,190
ugly way first so this is
n times 4 to the minus l this is to the

2234
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,200
n times 4 to the minus l this is to the
 

2235
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,309
n times 4 to the minus l this is to the
3

2236
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:48,319
3
 

2237
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,550
3
halves and then this is multiplied by a

2238
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,560
halves and then this is multiplied by a
 

2239
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,150
halves and then this is multiplied by a
to the l but whoever designed this

2240
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,160
to the l but whoever designed this
 

2241
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,230
to the l but whoever designed this
problem is really sneaky

2242
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
problem is really sneaky
 

2243
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,270
problem is really sneaky
right so what's four to the minus l to

2244
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280
right so what's four to the minus l to
 

2245
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,710
right so what's four to the minus l to
the three halves

2246
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:00,720

 

2247
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,829

any guesses yeah this is exactly eight

2248
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:03,839
any guesses yeah this is exactly eight
 

2249
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,270
any guesses yeah this is exactly eight
to the minus l if you work through all

2250
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:05,280
to the minus l if you work through all
 

2251
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,510
to the minus l if you work through all
of your exponent arithmetic

2252
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
of your exponent arithmetic
 

2253
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,710
of your exponent arithmetic
yeah why does that matter well it

2254
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:08,720
yeah why does that matter well it
 

2255
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,390
yeah why does that matter well it
exactly cancels this eight to the l term

2256
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,400
exactly cancels this eight to the l term
 

2257
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,870
exactly cancels this eight to the l term
here

2258
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
here
 

2259
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,630
here
this is actually exactly what case two

2260
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:12,640
this is actually exactly what case two
 

2261
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,309
this is actually exactly what case two
in master theorem is kind of trying to

2262
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:14,319
in master theorem is kind of trying to
 

2263
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,670
in master theorem is kind of trying to
capture

2264
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
capture
 

2265
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,390
capture
so this whole thing is equal to

2266
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,400
so this whole thing is equal to
 

2267
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,309
so this whole thing is equal to
of uh really just n to the three halves

2268
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319
of uh really just n to the three halves
 

2269
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,150
of uh really just n to the three halves
from l equals zero to the log

2270
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160
from l equals zero to the log
 

2271
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,790
from l equals zero to the log
base four of n all these constants just

2272
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:30,800
base four of n all these constants just
 

2273
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,829
base four of n all these constants just
go away isn't that beautiful

2274
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:32,839
go away isn't that beautiful
 

2275
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,990
go away isn't that beautiful
yes um good question no problem uh-hum

2276
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
yes um good question no problem uh-hum
 

2277
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,950
yes um good question no problem uh-hum
so do people ever use these for like

2278
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:38,960
so do people ever use these for like
 

2279
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,470
so do people ever use these for like
optimization

2280
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:40,480
optimization
 

2281
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,309
optimization
in terms of trying to write a better

2282
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319
in terms of trying to write a better
 

2283
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,790
in terms of trying to write a better
algorithm like try to minimize the

2284
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:44,800
algorithm like try to minimize the
 

2285
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,470
algorithm like try to minimize the
work per per level

2286
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
work per per level
 

2287
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,710
work per per level
yeah i'm just curious if that's like a

2288
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
yeah i'm just curious if that's like a
 

2289
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,910
yeah i'm just curious if that's like a
application that

2290
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:51,920
application that
 

2291
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,510
application that
sure i guess so i mean this is somehow a

2292
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
sure i guess so i mean this is somehow a
 

2293
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,349
sure i guess so i mean this is somehow a
visualization of how your algorithm is

2294
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:55,359
visualization of how your algorithm is
 

2295
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,390
visualization of how your algorithm is
making function calls

2296
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
making function calls
 

2297
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,870
making function calls
right so like every node here kind of

2298
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
right so like every node here kind of
 

2299
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,990
right so like every node here kind of
looks like a call

2300
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
looks like a call
 

2301
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,550
looks like a call
to your piece of code right so every

2302
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,560
to your piece of code right so every
 

2303
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,910
to your piece of code right so every
time you make a new one it's like making

2304
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
time you make a new one it's like making
 

2305
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,630
time you make a new one it's like making
a call

2306
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,640
a call
 

2307
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,309
a call
and then the divide here is kind of like

2308
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:06,319
and then the divide here is kind of like
 

2309
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,550
and then the divide here is kind of like
how much data goes into that function

2310
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
how much data goes into that function
 

2311
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,190
how much data goes into that function
call

2312
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
call
 

2313
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,630
call
so i think this is a useful way to kind

2314
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,640
so i think this is a useful way to kind
 

2315
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,150
so i think this is a useful way to kind
of visualize what's going on inside of

2316
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,160
of visualize what's going on inside of
 

2317
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,870
of visualize what's going on inside of
your code

2318
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:12,880
your code
 

2319
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,069
your code
and then if you're trying to optimize

2320
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079
and then if you're trying to optimize
 

2321
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,349
and then if you're trying to optimize
your code you're trying to basically

2322
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,359
your code you're trying to basically
 

2323
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,950
your code you're trying to basically
reduce the number of

2324
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:16,960
reduce the number of
 

2325
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,790
reduce the number of
nodes and or the amount of work that

2326
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:18,800
nodes and or the amount of work that
 

2327
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,309
nodes and or the amount of work that
each node does right

2328
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:20,319
each node does right
 

2329
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,829
each node does right
yeah so this is just like a nice way to

2330
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:21,839
yeah so this is just like a nice way to
 

2331
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,750
yeah so this is just like a nice way to
kind of visualize what's going on in a

2332
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
kind of visualize what's going on in a
 

2333
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,270
kind of visualize what's going on in a
recursive algorithm

2334
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
recursive algorithm
 

2335
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,950
recursive algorithm
yeah great question all right

2336
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
yeah great question all right
 

2337
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,270
yeah great question all right
so here's a here's a really nice thing

2338
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280
so here's a here's a really nice thing
 

2339
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,550
so here's a here's a really nice thing
does n to the three half depend on l

2340
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:34,560
does n to the three half depend on l
 

2341
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,750
does n to the three half depend on l
no right so this whole thing is equal to

2342
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:37,760
no right so this whole thing is equal to
 

2343
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,109
no right so this whole thing is equal to
c times n to the three halves

2344
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
c times n to the three halves
 

2345
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,309
c times n to the three halves
and my colleague in the back is going to

2346
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
and my colleague in the back is going to
 

2347
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,750
and my colleague in the back is going to
catch me if i don't if i don't make the

2348
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:43,760
catch me if i don't if i don't make the
 

2349
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,190
catch me if i don't if i don't make the
off by 1 error here

2350
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,200
off by 1 error here
 

2351
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,109
off by 1 error here
so uh this is log base 4 of n

2352
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:49,119
so uh this is log base 4 of n
 

2353
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,790
so uh this is log base 4 of n
plus 1 because my sum started at zero

2354
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:52,800
plus 1 because my sum started at zero
 

2355
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,950
plus 1 because my sum started at zero
yeah and notice that this is exactly

2356
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:58,960
yeah and notice that this is exactly
 

2357
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,030
yeah and notice that this is exactly
big o of n to the three halves log

2358
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
big o of n to the three halves log
 

2359
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,670
big o of n to the three halves log
n which agrees with what we did in a

2360
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:05,680
n which agrees with what we did in a
 

2361
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,030
n which agrees with what we did in a
much more easy case with the master

2362
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,040
much more easy case with the master
 

2363
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,430
much more easy case with the master
theorem

2364
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:07,440
theorem
 

2365
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,069
theorem
that make sense yeah so we found an

2366
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
that make sense yeah so we found an
 

2367
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,309
that make sense yeah so we found an
exact balance so could we say that it's

2368
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
exact balance so could we say that it's
 

2369
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,910
exact balance so could we say that it's
theta of n oh great question

2370
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:15,920
theta of n oh great question
 

2371
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,750
theta of n oh great question
this is where this notation is going to

2372
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
this is where this notation is going to
 

2373
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,309
this is where this notation is going to
be misleading this expression

2374
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:20,319
be misleading this expression
 

2375
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,910
be misleading this expression
in a vacuum is theta of this value

2376
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:23,920
in a vacuum is theta of this value
 

2377
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,510
in a vacuum is theta of this value
but the reason that i wrote big o is

2378
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
but the reason that i wrote big o is
 

2379
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,790
but the reason that i wrote big o is
because i only have an inequality all

2380
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:26,800
because i only have an inequality all
 

2381
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,230
because i only have an inequality all
the way up here so if i'm worried about

2382
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
the way up here so if i'm worried about
 

2383
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,230
the way up here so if i'm worried about
bounding this work

2384
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
bounding this work
 

2385
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,670
bounding this work
there's no reason to write a theta there

2386
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:31,680
there's no reason to write a theta there
 

2387
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,790
there's no reason to write a theta there
because it's just telling me some kind

2388
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:32,800
because it's just telling me some kind
 

2389
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,550
because it's just telling me some kind
of intermediate piece of information

2390
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
of intermediate piece of information
 

2391
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,670
of intermediate piece of information
yeah okay fabulous so

2392
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
yeah okay fabulous so
 

2393
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,069
yeah okay fabulous so
uh yes

2394
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079

 

2395
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,470

does the base of the log matter ah this

2396
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:44,480
does the base of the log matter ah this
 

2397
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,309
does the base of the log matter ah this
is a nice formula here

2398
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
is a nice formula here
 

2399
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,510
is a nice formula here
um so remember that

2400
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
um so remember that
 

2401
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,069
um so remember that
log base b of a is the same as log

2402
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:54,079
log base b of a is the same as log
 

2403
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,710
log base b of a is the same as log
a over log b if i got that right

2404
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
a over log b if i got that right
 

2405
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,069
a over log b if i got that right
yeah so the base of the log when it

2406
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
yeah so the base of the log when it
 

2407
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,510
yeah so the base of the log when it
comes to big o doesn't matter because

2408
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
comes to big o doesn't matter because
 

2409
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,270
comes to big o doesn't matter because
it's just a constant factor

2410
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
it's just a constant factor
 

2411
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,990
it's just a constant factor
yeah okay so that's part two of this

2412
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
yeah okay so that's part two of this
 

2413
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,109
yeah okay so that's part two of this
problem part three

2414
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
problem part three
 

2415
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,630
problem part three
is a little bit annoying because it has

2416
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
is a little bit annoying because it has
 

2417
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,349
is a little bit annoying because it has
two branches in it i wrote out a careful

2418
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:11,359
two branches in it i wrote out a careful
 

2419
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,150
two branches in it i wrote out a careful
solution

2420
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,160
solution
 

2421
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,990
solution
um it does not apply the master theorem

2422
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
um it does not apply the master theorem
 

2423
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,190
um it does not apply the master theorem
because it's irrelevant at least the

2424
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
because it's irrelevant at least the
 

2425
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,430
because it's irrelevant at least the
version that we know in this class

2426
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
version that we know in this class
 

2427
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,349
version that we know in this class
um so we're going to kind of skip that

2428
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
um so we're going to kind of skip that
 

2429
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,390
um so we're going to kind of skip that
for now because i don't think it's

2430
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
for now because i don't think it's
 

2431
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,069
for now because i don't think it's
terribly relevant to

2432
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:22,079
terribly relevant to
 

2433
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,349
terribly relevant to
most of the algorithms that we'll see in

2434
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
most of the algorithms that we'll see in
 

2435
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,190
most of the algorithms that we'll see in
6006 but we'll come back to it if we

2436
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,200
6006 but we'll come back to it if we
 

2437
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:25,990
6006 but we'll come back to it if we
have time

2438
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,000
have time
 

2439
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,990
have time
uh yes can we make that a lower bound

2440
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,000
uh yes can we make that a lower bound
 

2441
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,510
uh yes can we make that a lower bound
and an upper bound using master's

2442
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
and an upper bound using master's
 

2443
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,790
and an upper bound using master's
theorem

2444

i'm gonna refer you to the solutions

2450
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:37,280
i'm gonna refer you to the solutions
 

2451
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,630
i'm gonna refer you to the solutions
rather than talking about that problem

2452
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
rather than talking about that problem
 

2453
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,069
rather than talking about that problem
uh right now yeah

2454
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079
uh right now yeah
 

2455
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,670
uh right now yeah
uh okay cool all right so that's how you

2456
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
uh okay cool all right so that's how you
 

2457
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,430
uh okay cool all right so that's how you
apply master theorem which is

2458
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:45,440
apply master theorem which is
 

2459
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,430
apply master theorem which is
mildly painful the good news is the rest

2460
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:47,440
mildly painful the good news is the rest
 

2461
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,630
mildly painful the good news is the rest
of this problem set is actually i

2462
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
of this problem set is actually i
 

2463
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,990
of this problem set is actually i
consider it to be much easier than the

2464
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,000
consider it to be much easier than the
 

2465
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,430
consider it to be much easier than the
first one which is why i think it's okay

2466
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
first one which is why i think it's okay
 

2467
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:51,910
first one which is why i think it's okay

00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:13,839
she's looking for a stone on a planet
 

2553
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,109
she's looking for a stone on a planet
and the planet has some index

2554
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:15,119
and the planet has some index
 

2555
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,190
and the planet has some index
k and unfortunately for us there are

2556

the number of planets is is quite large

2558
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,160
the number of planets is is quite large
 

2559
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,670
the number of planets is is quite large
it's infinity in fact

2560
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
it's infinity in fact
 

2561
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,950
it's infinity in fact
because it's the infinity stone um

2562
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:26,960
because it's the infinity stone um
 

2563
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,870
because it's the infinity stone um
or sorry did i say that i think it's the

2564
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
or sorry did i say that i think it's the
 

2565
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,230
or sorry did i say that i think it's the
infinity phone or something i

2566
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
infinity phone or something i
 

2567
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,950
infinity phone or something i
i forget but but in any event um the

2568
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
i forget but but in any event um the
 

2569
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,390

on a planet

2572
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:35,920
on a planet
 

2573
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,710
on a planet
is ask an oracle is the index of my

2574
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720
is ask an oracle is the index of my
 

2575
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,630
is ask an oracle is the index of my
planet bigger or smaller

2576
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:40,640
planet bigger or smaller
 

2577
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,069
planet bigger or smaller
than the index of the planet that i'm

2578
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:42,079
than the index of the planet that i'm
 

2579
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,910
than the index of the planet that i'm
standing on

2580
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,920
standing on
 

2581
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,069
standing on
right and then the question is in log k

2582
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
right and then the question is in log k
 

2583
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,109
right and then the question is in log k
time where k

2584
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:47,119
time where k
 

2585
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,109
time where k
is the index of the planet notice that's

2586
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:49,119
is the index of the planet notice that's
 

2587
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,470
is the index of the planet notice that's
already a little weird because it's like

2588
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
already a little weird because it's like
 

2589
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,910
already a little weird because it's like
not the size of your data

2590
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:51,920
not the size of your data
 

2591
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,230
not the size of your data
quite um can you find the the planet

2592
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:56,240
quite um can you find the the planet
 

2593
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,790
quite um can you find the the planet
now what does this kind of problem like

2594
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
now what does this kind of problem like
 

2595
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,349
now what does this kind of problem like
what is it

2596
00:46:59,349 --> 00:46:59,359
what is it
 

2597
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,270
what is it
screaming out for you to use like you

2598
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
screaming out for you to use like you
 

2599
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,710
screaming out for you to use like you
see a log k you're looking for something

2600
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:04,720
see a log k you're looking for something
 

2601
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,270
see a log k you're looking for something
by section right or binary search that's

2602
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:07,280
by section right or binary search that's
 

2603
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,069
by section right or binary search that's
absolutely right

2604
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:08,079
absolutely right
 

2605
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,270
absolutely right
those are both great answers but

2606
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
those are both great answers but
 

2607
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,309
those are both great answers but
there's a bit of a problem which is that

2608
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
there's a bit of a problem which is that
 

2609
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,950
there's a bit of a problem which is that
the number of planets is unbounded we

2610
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:16,960
the number of planets is unbounded we
 

2611
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,430
the number of planets is unbounded we
don't know how many planets there are

2612
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
don't know how many planets there are
 

2613
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,710
don't know how many planets there are
in um this this little universe that

2614
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:22,720
in um this this little universe that
 

2615
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,150
in um this this little universe that
problem 1.2

2616
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:24,160
problem 1.2
 

2617
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,430
problem 1.2
sets up yeah so our intuition is that we

2618
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,440
sets up yeah so our intuition is that we
 

2619
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,870
sets up yeah so our intuition is that we
want to use binary search but

2620
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:28,880
want to use binary search but
 

2621
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,069
want to use binary search but
in order to do binary search i need to

2622
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079
in order to do binary search i need to
 

2623
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,190
in order to do binary search i need to
have a left and a right hand side and

2624
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:31,200
have a left and a right hand side and
 

2625
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,309
have a left and a right hand side and
divide and i have no right hand side

2626
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
divide and i have no right hand side
 

2627
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,430
divide and i have no right hand side
so what can i do how's a how's a super

2628
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,440
so what can i do how's a how's a super
 

2629
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:37,990
so what can i do how's a how's a super
villain to

2630
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,000
villain to
 

2631
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,470
villain to
solve this problem

2632
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480

 

2633
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,390

well remember that each planet has an

2634
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,400
well remember that each planet has an
 

2635
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,750
well remember that each planet has an
oracle on it telling me like is there

2636
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:45,760
oracle on it telling me like is there
 

2637
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,309
oracle on it telling me like is there
something to my left or my right yeah

2638
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:48,319
something to my left or my right yeah
 

2639
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,990
something to my left or my right yeah
so i could start at planet number one

2640
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,000
so i could start at planet number one
 

2641
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,190
so i could start at planet number one
and i could just start walking from

2642
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:51,200
and i could just start walking from
 

2643
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,750
and i could just start walking from
planet one to planet two to planet three

2644
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:53,760
planet one to planet two to planet three
 

2645
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,829
planet one to planet two to planet three
planet four and asking like am i there

2646
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:55,839
planet four and asking like am i there
 

2647
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,030
planet four and asking like am i there
yet am i there yet

2648
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
yet am i there yet
 

2649
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,990
yet am i there yet
how much time is that going to take

2650
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:00,000
how much time is that going to take
 

2651
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,870
how much time is that going to take
potentially

2652
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:00,880
potentially
 

2653
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,630
potentially
actually it won't take infinite time i

2654
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
actually it won't take infinite time i
 

2655
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,030
actually it won't take infinite time i
got you how much time will it take when

2656
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
got you how much time will it take when
 

2657
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,270
got you how much time will it take when
will i stop

2658
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
will i stop
 

2659
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,190
will i stop
when i hit planet k right because i know

2660
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,200
when i hit planet k right because i know
 

2661
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,190
when i hit planet k right because i know
that planet k is out there somewhere

2662
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
that planet k is out there somewhere
 

2663
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,430
that planet k is out there somewhere
the truth is out there and when i find

2664
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:13,440
the truth is out there and when i find
 

2665
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,190
the truth is out there and when i find
it and i step on it i stop

2666
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,200
it and i step on it i stop
 

2667
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,990
it and i step on it i stop
and i took exactly k steps maybe k minus

2668
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,000
and i took exactly k steps maybe k minus
 

2669
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,670
and i took exactly k steps maybe k minus
1 depending how you count

2670
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:19,680
1 depending how you count
 

2671
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,470
1 depending how you count
but we need a log k algorithm yeah so

2672
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:22,480
but we need a log k algorithm yeah so
 

2673
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,510
but we need a log k algorithm yeah so
what could i do

2674
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:23,520
what could i do
 

2675
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,870
what could i do
um if you start at some k then

2676
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
um if you start at some k then
 

2677
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,510
um if you start at some k then
right you can multiply by another case

2678
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:29,520
right you can multiply by another case
 

2679
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,870
right you can multiply by another case
multiplied by another k

2680
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
multiplied by another k
 

2681
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,470
multiplied by another k
it's actually like proceeded by another

2682
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:32,480
it's actually like proceeded by another
 

2683
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:44,309
it's actually like proceeded by another
k minus

2684
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:44,319

 

2685
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,870

yeah so okay so you got the right you're

2686
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:46,880
yeah so okay so you got the right you're
 

2687
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,990
yeah so okay so you got the right you're
the right church wrong pew

2688
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
the right church wrong pew
 

2689
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,230
the right church wrong pew
here so the the basic intuition here is

2690
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:50,240
here so the the basic intuition here is
 

2691
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,910
here so the the basic intuition here is
that stepping one planet at a time

2692
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:51,920
that stepping one planet at a time
 

2693
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,510
that stepping one planet at a time
doesn't step fast enough

2694
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:53,520
doesn't step fast enough
 

2695
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,030
doesn't step fast enough
um if you work out the details in that

2696
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
um if you work out the details in that
 

2697
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,309
um if you work out the details in that
one you're going to find that you'll end

2698
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
one you're going to find that you'll end
 

2699
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,829
one you're going to find that you'll end
up with a run time that still

2700
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
up with a run time that still
 

2701
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,150
up with a run time that still
grows a little bit too quickly in in in

2702
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,160
grows a little bit too quickly in in in
 

2703
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,190
grows a little bit too quickly in in in
k here

2704
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,200
k here
 

2705
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,670
k here
right in some sense you one way if you

2706
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:03,680
right in some sense you one way if you
 

2707
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,109
right in some sense you one way if you
were to reverse engineer this problem

2708
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,119
were to reverse engineer this problem
 

2709
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,150
were to reverse engineer this problem
which isn't really a great way to

2710
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,160
which isn't really a great way to
 

2711
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,430
which isn't really a great way to
problem set you really do expect there

2712
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,440
problem set you really do expect there
 

2713
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,710
problem set you really do expect there
to be powers of two

2714
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,720
to be powers of two
 

2715
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,470
to be powers of two
in every step of your algorithm yes

2716
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:12,480
in every step of your algorithm yes
 

2717
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,150
in every step of your algorithm yes
the binary search of like start in the

2718
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,160
the binary search of like start in the
 

2719
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,290
the binary search of like start in the
middle and

2720
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:16,300
middle and

this is the right intuition but there's

2724
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
this is the right intuition but there's
 

2725
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,030
this is the right intuition but there's
i have a philosophical question for you

2726
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
i have a philosophical question for you
 

2727
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,230
i have a philosophical question for you
which is what is the middle of an

2728
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:24,240
which is what is the middle of an
 

2729
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,030
which is what is the middle of an
infinite set of planets

2730
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,040
infinite set of planets
 

2731
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,990
infinite set of planets
infinite exactly that's a problem yes um

2732
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:30,000
infinite exactly that's a problem yes um
 

2733
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,710
infinite exactly that's a problem yes um
we could

2734
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
we could
 

2735
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,950
we could
use like um i don't know who it was back

2736
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:32,960
use like um i don't know who it was back
 

2737
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,990
use like um i don't know who it was back
there who was

2738
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
there who was
 

2739
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,549
there who was
suggesting using doing i squared verbs

2740
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:36,559
suggesting using doing i squared verbs
 

2741
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,349
suggesting using doing i squared verbs
instead for

2742
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:37,359
instead for
 

2743
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,030
instead for
doing i squared replace it with 2 to the

2744
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
doing i squared replace it with 2 to the
 

2745
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,190
doing i squared replace it with 2 to the
i that's exactly right that's a great

2746
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,200
i that's exactly right that's a great
 

2747
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,270
i that's exactly right that's a great
intuition so let's let's formalize that

2748
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:43,280
intuition so let's let's formalize that
 

2749
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,150
intuition so let's let's formalize that
a little bit

2750
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,160
a little bit
 

2751
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,990
a little bit
which is like i could do binary search

2752
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:46,000
which is like i could do binary search
 

2753
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,109
which is like i could do binary search
if i had a right-hand side i have

2754
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
if i had a right-hand side i have
 

2755
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,710
if i had a right-hand side i have
left-hand side because it's one

2756
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
left-hand side because it's one
 

2757
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,750
left-hand side because it's one
so what i'm going to do i'm going to

2758
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:49,760
so what i'm going to do i'm going to
 

2759
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,670
so what i'm going to do i'm going to
keep trying right hand sides and the

2760
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:51,680
keep trying right hand sides and the
 

2761
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,190
keep trying right hand sides and the
oracle is going to tell me

2762
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,200
oracle is going to tell me
 

2763
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,670
oracle is going to tell me
is this a valid right-hand side right

2764
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
is this a valid right-hand side right
 

2765
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,950
is this a valid right-hand side right
because the oracle is telling me is

2766
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
because the oracle is telling me is
 

2767
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,030
because the oracle is telling me is
there a planet to my left

2768
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
there a planet to my left
 

2769
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,430
there a planet to my left
yeah so here's what i'm going to do

2770
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,440
yeah so here's what i'm going to do
 

2771
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,190
yeah so here's what i'm going to do
again i don't like the index i in the

2772
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:03,200
again i don't like the index i in the
 

2773
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,630
again i don't like the index i in the
official solution there's an i but i use

2774
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
official solution there's an i but i use
 

2775
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,190
official solution there's an i but i use
the letter m

2776
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,200
the letter m
 

2777
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,470
the letter m
because i can um which is

2778
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:08,480
because i can um which is
 

2779
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,270
because i can um which is
the following i'm going to visit

2780
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
the following i'm going to visit
 

2781
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,470
the following i'm going to visit
i hate teaching no that's not true i

2782
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:16,480
i hate teaching no that's not true i
 

2783
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,230
i hate teaching no that's not true i
like teaching i just don't like chuck

2784
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
like teaching i just don't like chuck
 

2785
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:24,150
like teaching i just don't like chuck
um i'm gonna visit planet

2786
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,160

 

2787
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,150

two to the m for each m um

2788
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,160
two to the m for each m um
 

2789
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,950
two to the m for each m um
you know starting with m equals zero

2790
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:30,960
you know starting with m equals zero
 

2791
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,630
you know starting with m equals zero
from

2792
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:34,640

 

2793
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,109

and uh essentially until uh

2794
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:39,119

 

2795
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,870

remember that k is the index of the

2796
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:40,880
remember that k is the index of the
 

2797
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,950
remember that k is the index of the
planet i'm looking for so eventually i'm

2798
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960
planet i'm looking for so eventually i'm
 

2799
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,990
planet i'm looking for so eventually i'm
going to reach the point

2800
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:44,000
going to reach the point
 

2801
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,910
going to reach the point
where k is less than or equal to 2 to

2802
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:45,920
where k is less than or equal to 2 to
 

2803
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,230
where k is less than or equal to 2 to
the m and i know that i can query my

2804
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,240
the m and i know that i can query my
 

2805
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,589
the m and i know that i can query my
oracle and they're going to tell me when

2806
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:49,599
oracle and they're going to tell me when
 

2807
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,309
oracle and they're going to tell me when
that's the case

2808
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319

 

2809
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,190

so how much time does this take right so

2810
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,200
so how much time does this take right so
 

2811
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,670
so how much time does this take right so
i'm going to try

2812
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:55,680
i'm going to try
 

2813
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,030
i'm going to try
planet 1 and then planet 2 and then

2814
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
planet 1 and then planet 2 and then
 

2815
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,910
planet 1 and then planet 2 and then
planet 4 and then 8 and 16

2816
00:50:59,910 --> 00:50:59,920
planet 4 and then 8 and 16
 

2817
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,670
planet 4 and then 8 and 16
all the way up until k

2818
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:03,680

 

2819
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,230

so it's going to take log k time yeah

2820
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:06,240
so it's going to take log k time yeah
 

2821
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,510
so it's going to take log k time yeah
you also have a

2822
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:07,520
you also have a
 

2823
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,349
you also have a
stronger lower bound now to that minus

2824
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
stronger lower bound now to that minus
 

2825
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,589
stronger lower bound now to that minus
one

2826
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:11,599

 

2827
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,270

yeah that's sort of right so so right so

2828
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:13,280
yeah that's sort of right so so right so
 

2829
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,470
yeah that's sort of right so so right so
eventually what's going to happen when

2830
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,480
eventually what's going to happen when
 

2831
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,349
eventually what's going to happen when
you stop here

2832
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:15,359
you stop here
 

2833
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,910
you stop here
is that 2 to the m minus 1 is going to

2834
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:17,920
is that 2 to the m minus 1 is going to
 

2835
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,510
is that 2 to the m minus 1 is going to
be less than or equal to k

2836
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:19,520
be less than or equal to k
 

2837
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,910
be less than or equal to k
less than equal to 2 to the m right

2838
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:21,920
less than equal to 2 to the m right
 

2839
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,950
less than equal to 2 to the m right
because then then

2840
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:22,960
because then then
 

2841
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,790
because then then
because this is the condition for

2842
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:24,800
because this is the condition for
 

2843
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,549
because this is the condition for
stopping this is the condition for not

2844
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:26,559
stopping this is the condition for not
 

2845
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,430
stopping this is the condition for not
stopping

2846
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:27,440
stopping
 

2847
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,829
stopping
so when you stop k this little sandwich

2848
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
so when you stop k this little sandwich
 

2849
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,589
so when you stop k this little sandwich
is true

2850
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
is true
 

2851
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,349
is true
yeah so if i take the log essentially

2852
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:33,359
yeah so if i take the log essentially
 

2853
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,630
yeah so if i take the log essentially
what i've shown

2854
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
what i've shown
 

2855
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,630
what i've shown
is that i've taken right because m is

2856
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
is that i've taken right because m is
 

2857
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,910
is that i've taken right because m is
like the number of steps in this part of

2858
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
like the number of steps in this part of
 

2859
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,270
like the number of steps in this part of
my algorithm

2860
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,280
my algorithm
 

2861
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,710
my algorithm
so if i take the log i'm going to find

2862
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:40,720
so if i take the log i'm going to find
 

2863
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,430
so if i take the log i'm going to find
that i took log k steps

2864
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:43,440
that i took log k steps
 

2865
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,990
that i took log k steps
yeah now that's acknowledgment yeah okay

2866
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:46,000
yeah now that's acknowledgment yeah okay
 

2867
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,470
yeah now that's acknowledgment yeah okay
uh

2868
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:46,480
uh
 

2869
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,349
uh
and then well now um now i have an upper

2870
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359
and then well now um now i have an upper
 

2871
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,950
and then well now um now i have an upper
bound and a lower bound

2872
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
bound and a lower bound
 

2873
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,150
bound and a lower bound
so now what can i do yeah now i can

2874
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
so now what can i do yeah now i can
 

2875
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,150
so now what can i do yeah now i can
binary search and that also takes log k

2876
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
binary search and that also takes log k
 

2877
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,109
binary search and that also takes log k
time

2878
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:01,119

 

2879
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,589

that's exactly right oops

2880
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:05,599
that's exactly right oops
 

2881
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,670
that's exactly right oops
so now i have step two is also binary

2882
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
so now i have step two is also binary
 

2883
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,790
so now i have step two is also binary
search and

2884
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:08,800
search and
 

2885
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,030
search and
it's also a log k time and our problem

2886
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,040
it's also a log k time and our problem
 

2887
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,470
it's also a log k time and our problem
is solved so problem number two is not

2888
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
is solved so problem number two is not
 

2889
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,150
is solved so problem number two is not
so hard

2890
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
so hard
 

2891
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,589
so hard
anybody with me any questions about that

2892
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:15,599
anybody with me any questions about that
 

2893
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,589
anybody with me any questions about that
one that's a quick one

2894
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:17,599
one that's a quick one
 

2895
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,069
one that's a quick one
okay now problem three really spoke to

2896
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:20,079
okay now problem three really spoke to
 

2897
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,910
okay now problem three really spoke to
me as a computer graphics professor

2898
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:21,920
me as a computer graphics professor
 

2899
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,190
me as a computer graphics professor
so uh right so now i am running

2900
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,200
so uh right so now i am running
 

2901
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,270
so uh right so now i am running
for dobie

2902
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,280

 

2903

um i have some

2904
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
um i have some
 

2905
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,630
um i have some
i've collaborated a lot with adobe free

2906
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:36,640
i've collaborated a lot with adobe free
 

2907
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,430
i've collaborated a lot with adobe free
search

2908
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
search
 

2909
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,069
search
um right so uh fidobi is trying to make

2910
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
um right so uh fidobi is trying to make
 

2911
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,390
um right so uh fidobi is trying to make
a piece of software uh for image editing

2912
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:42,400
a piece of software uh for image editing
 

2913
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,109
a piece of software uh for image editing
and what does my piece of software do

2914
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:45,119
and what does my piece of software do
 

2915
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,390
and what does my piece of software do
well uh my

2916
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,400
well uh my
 

2917
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,910
well uh my
my uh my image or i guess my document

2918
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
my uh my image or i guess my document
 

2919
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,349
my uh my image or i guess my document
consists of a bunch of images that are

2920
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
consists of a bunch of images that are
 

2921
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,510
consists of a bunch of images that are
overlaid with one another

2922
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
overlaid with one another
 

2923
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,030
overlaid with one another
okay and essentially what's happening

2924
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,040
okay and essentially what's happening
 

2925
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,549
okay and essentially what's happening
inside of the software is i want to keep

2926
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:56,559
inside of the software is i want to keep
 

2927
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,670
inside of the software is i want to keep
all the images

2928
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:57,680
all the images
 

2929
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,470
all the images
in order from like top to bottom okay

2930
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:00,480
in order from like top to bottom okay
 

2931
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,309
in order from like top to bottom okay
because when i render uh my photo

2932
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
because when i render uh my photo
 

2933
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,589
because when i render uh my photo
what do i do i render the bottom one and

2934
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:03,599
what do i do i render the bottom one and
 

2935
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,950
what do i do i render the bottom one and
then the next one and so on and just

2936
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
then the next one and so on and just
 

2937
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,230
then the next one and so on and just
layer them on top of each other

2938
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240
layer them on top of each other
 

2939
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,030
layer them on top of each other
like if you've ever played with

2940
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
like if you've ever played with
 

2941
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,589
like if you've ever played with
powerpoint or photoshop or i guess

2942
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:09,599
powerpoint or photoshop or i guess
 

2943
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,549
powerpoint or photoshop or i guess
whatever fake name

00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:10,559
whatever fake name
 

2945
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,309
whatever fake name
they're giving here that's a pretty

2946
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:12,319
they're giving here that's a pretty
 

2947
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,549
they're giving here that's a pretty
common uh user interface to encounter

2948
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:16,559
common uh user interface to encounter
 

2949
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,270
common uh user interface to encounter
and so what they've asked you to do is

2950
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,280
and so what they've asked you to do is
 

2951
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,390
and so what they've asked you to do is
to come up

to come up
 

2953
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,750
to come up
with essentially a data structure and

2954
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:21,760
with essentially a data structure and
 

2955
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,549
with essentially a data structure and
your data structure has to support a few

2956
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:24,559
your data structure has to support a few
 

2957
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,510
your data structure has to support a few
different operations in particular you

2958
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:27,520
different operations in particular you
 

2959
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,750
different operations in particular you
have to be able to make a document

2960
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
have to be able to make a document
 

2961
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,630
have to be able to make a document
import an image and then stick it on top

2962
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
import an image and then stick it on top
 

2963
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,270
import an image and then stick it on top
uh

2964
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:33,280
uh
 

2965
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,829
uh
display which returns all the ids in the

2966
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:35,839
display which returns all the ids in the
 

2967
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:36,309
display which returns all the ids in the
order

2968
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:36,319
order
 

2969
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,430
order
uh that you store them and then there's

2970
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
uh that you store them and then there's
 

2971
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,710
uh that you store them and then there's
a real kicker

2972
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:40,720
a real kicker
 

2973
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,470
a real kicker
which is that you need to be able to

2974
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,480
which is that you need to be able to
 

2975
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,990
which is that you need to be able to
take one of the

2976
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
take one of the
 

2977
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,589
take one of the
the thing one of the layers and stick it

2978
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:45,599
the thing one of the layers and stick it
 

2979
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,750
the thing one of the layers and stick it
underneath another one

2980
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760
underneath another one
 

2981
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,589
underneath another one
but you have to do that in log in time

2982
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:49,599
but you have to do that in log in time
 

2983
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:50,790
but you have to do that in log in time
it's that butt that makes this whole

2984
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
it's that butt that makes this whole
 

2985
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,870
it's that butt that makes this whole
problem kind of a pain in the took us

2986
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:52,880
problem kind of a pain in the took us
 

2987
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,150
problem kind of a pain in the took us
yeah uh so right so again uh here are

2988
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,160
yeah uh so right so again uh here are
 

2989
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,790
yeah uh so right so again uh here are
operations we've got to make

2990
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:00,800

 

2991
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,710

an empty dot

2992
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:04,720

 

2993
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,510

this is supposed to take order one time

2994
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520
this is supposed to take order one time
 

2995
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,309
this is supposed to take order one time
we're going to uh

2996
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
we're going to uh
 

2997
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,430
we're going to uh
import which adds an

x on top and that this should take
 

3001
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,510
x on top and that this should take
order end time notice that this is

3002
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:19,520
order end time notice that this is
 

3003
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,510
order end time notice that this is
already a little suspicious if i were

3004
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:21,520
already a little suspicious if i were
 

3005
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,510
already a little suspicious if i were
like trying to psychologically diagnose

3006
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
like trying to psychologically diagnose
 

3007
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:23,990
like trying to psychologically diagnose
my my

3008
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000
my my
 

3009
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,150
my my
professors i would look at this this

3010
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
professors i would look at this this
 

3011
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,390
professors i would look at this this
order end with some

3012
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,400
order end with some
 

3013
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,870
order end with some
like with a raised eyebrow right because

3014
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:30,880
like with a raised eyebrow right because
 

3015
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,990
like with a raised eyebrow right because
probably like what would you have in

3016
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,000
probably like what would you have in
 

3017
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,589
probably like what would you have in
mind if you're like talking about stacks

3018
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:33,599
mind if you're like talking about stacks
 

3019
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:34,549
mind if you're like talking about stacks
of photographs

3020
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:34,559
of photographs
 

3021
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,069
of photographs
would be like a you know a stack or

3022
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
would be like a you know a stack or
 

3023
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,390
would be like a you know a stack or
queue or some data structure like that

3024
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:38,400
queue or some data structure like that
 

3025
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,990
queue or some data structure like that
but then insertion would be like order

3026
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,000
but then insertion would be like order
 

3027
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,589
but then insertion would be like order
one time you know so there's clearly

3028
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:41,599
one time you know so there's clearly
 

3029
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:42,870
one time you know so there's clearly
something a little more complicated

3030
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:42,880
something a little more complicated
 

3031
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,630
something a little more complicated
going on

3032
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,640
going on
 

3033
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,230
going on
okay uh what's number three

3034
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,240
okay uh what's number three
 

3035
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,230
okay uh what's number three
is um display uh

3036
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240

 

3037
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,630

this has to happen in order end time

3038
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:56,640
this has to happen in order end time
 

3039
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,829
this has to happen in order end time
this one kind of makes sense right

3040
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
this one kind of makes sense right
 

3041
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,430
this one kind of makes sense right
because in order to display n things you

3042
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440
because in order to display n things you
 

3043
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,990
because in order to display n things you
kind of expect to take at least end time

3044
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:02,000
kind of expect to take at least end time
 

3045
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,430
kind of expect to take at least end time
uh and then finally

3046
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,440

 

3047
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,950

we have to move below

3048
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960

 

3049
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,190

and this has to take order login time

3050
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200

 

3051
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,349

uh and this is going to be the kicker

3052
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:17,359
uh and this is going to be the kicker
 

3053
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,950
uh and this is going to be the kicker
right because we really uh this is

3054
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
right because we really uh this is
 

3055
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,710
right because we really uh this is
this is somehow not totally obvious from

3056
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:20,720
this is somehow not totally obvious from
 

3057
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,910
this is somehow not totally obvious from
from the way that we set up our problem

3058
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:23,920
from the way that we set up our problem
 

3059
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,510
from the way that we set up our problem
so everybody understand the problem set

3060
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
so everybody understand the problem set
 

3061
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,349
so everybody understand the problem set
up so far we just keep adding objects

3062
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:27,359
up so far we just keep adding objects
 

3063
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,549
up so far we just keep adding objects
with ids

3064
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
with ids
 

3065
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,829
with ids
and we need to be able to insert them on

3066
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:29,839
and we need to be able to insert them on
 

3067
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,910
and we need to be able to insert them on
the top and then kind of reorder them

3068
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
the top and then kind of reorder them
 

3069
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,230
the top and then kind of reorder them
and the problem has given you run time

3070
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,240
and the problem has given you run time
 

3071
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,829
and the problem has given you run time
for each of these different operations

3072
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:37,839
for each of these different operations
 

3073
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,030
for each of these different operations
okay right so here's the thing there's

3074
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:41,040
okay right so here's the thing there's
 

3075
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,910
okay right so here's the thing there's
like kind of a

3076
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:41,920
like kind of a
 

3077
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,870
like kind of a
sequence aspect to our problem and kind

3078
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:44,880
sequence aspect to our problem and kind
 

3079
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,630
sequence aspect to our problem and kind
of a set

3080
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:46,640
of a set
 

3081
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,230
of a set
aspect to our problem does that make

3082
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,240
aspect to our problem does that make
 

3083
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,069
aspect to our problem does that make
sense like the sequence aspect to our

3084
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:50,079
sense like the sequence aspect to our
 

3085
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,270
sense like the sequence aspect to our
problem is that we're going to have to

3086
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,280
problem is that we're going to have to
 

3087
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,030
problem is that we're going to have to
display stuff in order end time right

3088
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,040
display stuff in order end time right
 

3089
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,309
display stuff in order end time right
we've got to iterate over our whole list

3090
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:54,319
we've got to iterate over our whole list
 

3091
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,549
we've got to iterate over our whole list
put stuff on top and so on

3092
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
put stuff on top and so on
 

3093
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,789
put stuff on top and so on
and the set aspect is that we'd like to

3094
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
and the set aspect is that we'd like to
 

3095
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,950
and the set aspect is that we'd like to
move stuff on top of each other

3096
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:00,960
move stuff on top of each other
 

3097
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,630
move stuff on top of each other
in log end time and the reason that i

3098
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
in log end time and the reason that i
 

3099
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,390
in log end time and the reason that i
say that this is somehow set

3100
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:04,400
say that this is somehow set
 

3101
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,710
say that this is somehow set
aspect is that i need to be able to put

3102
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:06,720
aspect is that i need to be able to put
 

3103
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,750
aspect is that i need to be able to put
any x underneath

3104
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:07,760
any x underneath
 

3105
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,829
any x underneath
any y which means that i need to be able

3106
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839
any y which means that i need to be able
 

3107
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:10,870
any y which means that i need to be able
to quickly find

3108
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:10,880
to quickly find
 

3109
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,349
to quickly find
what layer the x and the y is in

3110
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359

 

3111
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,630

any ideas how we could solve this

3112
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
any ideas how we could solve this
 

3113
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,230
any ideas how we could solve this
problem how about some from some folks i

3114
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:18,240
problem how about some from some folks i
 

3115
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,549
problem how about some from some folks i
haven't heard from you

3116
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:22,559

 

3117
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,030

yes

3118
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,040

 

3119
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,870

yeah that's a really great idea so maybe

3120
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:28,880
yeah that's a really great idea so maybe
 

3121
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,470
yeah that's a really great idea so maybe
i'm going to maintain so remember we've

3122
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
i'm going to maintain so remember we've
 

3123
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,109
i'm going to maintain so remember we've
talked about

3124
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
talked about
 

3125
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,950
talked about
uh let's see in in my lecture two

3126
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
uh let's see in in my lecture two
 

3127
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,870
uh let's see in in my lecture two
lectures ago we kind of thought of a

3128
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
lectures ago we kind of thought of a
 

3129
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,190
lectures ago we kind of thought of a
sorted list as like a set

3130
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,200
sorted list as like a set
 

3131
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,789
sorted list as like a set
data structure so yeah so that's that's

3132
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:40,799
data structure so yeah so that's that's
 

3133
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,390
data structure so yeah so that's that's
a fabulous idea why don't we

3134
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:42,400
a fabulous idea why don't we
 

3135
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,150
a fabulous idea why don't we
for the set part of our problem

3136
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,160

 

3137
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,309

we're going to store in particular a

3138
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:50,319
we're going to store in particular a
 

3139
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:57,030
we're going to store in particular a
sorted array

3140
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,040

 

3141
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,950

of uh and for now let's think about like

3142
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:58,960
of uh and for now let's think about like
 

3143
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,309
of uh and for now let's think about like
a sorted array of x's

3144
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:02,319
a sorted array of x's
 

3145
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,589
a sorted array of x's
and so this is going to be able to help

3146
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:03,599
and so this is going to be able to help
 

3147
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,430
and so this is going to be able to help
us answer questions

3148
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
us answer questions
 

3149
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,549
us answer questions
like you know is this id in my my set of

3150
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:08,559
like you know is this id in my my set of
 

3151
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,390
like you know is this id in my my set of
images or not

3152
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:10,400
images or not
 

3153
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,589
images or not
but there's also going to be a second

3154
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:11,599
but there's also going to be a second
 

3155
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,510
but there's also going to be a second
part of my problem which is in addition

3156
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:13,520
part of my problem which is in addition
 

3157
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,109
part of my problem which is in addition
to that i need to be able to keep a

3158
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
to that i need to be able to keep a
 

3159
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,789
to that i need to be able to keep a
different ordering other than being just

3160
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:16,799
different ordering other than being just
 

3161
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,829
different ordering other than being just
ordered by x

3162
00:57:17,829 --> 00:57:17,839
ordered by x
 

3163
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,190
ordered by x
which is the ordering that they're being

3164
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:19,200
which is the ordering that they're being
 

3165
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,190
which is the ordering that they're being
like drawn on the screen right that's

3166
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,200
like drawn on the screen right that's
 

3167
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,630
like drawn on the screen right that's
different than the ordering of their ids

3168
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:24,640
different than the ordering of their ids
 

3169
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,589
different than the ordering of their ids
so for that um good question we're gonna

3170
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:27,599
so for that um good question we're gonna
 

3171
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,109
so for that um good question we're gonna
be building a sorted array

3172
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:29,119
be building a sorted array
 

3173
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,430
be building a sorted array
with nothing in it and it's gonna be o

3174
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,440
with nothing in it and it's gonna be o
 

3175
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,670
with nothing in it and it's gonna be o
of n log n time but that's undefined

3176
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:33,680
of n log n time but that's undefined
 

3177
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,910
of n log n time but that's undefined
so we can we actually go to this one

3178
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:35,920
so we can we actually go to this one
 

3179
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,349
so we can we actually go to this one
we're gonna write it with nothing

3180
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
we're gonna write it with nothing
 

3181
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:41,430
we're gonna write it with nothing
hmm okay uh

3182
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
hmm okay uh
 

3183
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,910
hmm okay uh
no i'm not sure i quite follow uh um

3184
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:43,920
no i'm not sure i quite follow uh um
 

3185
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,630
no i'm not sure i quite follow uh um
it's uh

3186
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
it's uh
 

3187
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,510
it's uh
building an empty sort of array of n log

3188
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
building an empty sort of array of n log
 

3189
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,750
building an empty sort of array of n log
n time which is o of zero log zero time

3190
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,760
n time which is o of zero log zero time
 

3191
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,589
n time which is o of zero log zero time
and log zero is entered

3192
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:51,599
and log zero is entered
 

3193
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,270
and log zero is entered
array yeah building an empty anything

3194
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
array yeah building an empty anything
 

3195
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,630
array yeah building an empty anything
takes one time

3196
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:54,640
takes one time
 

3197
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,750
takes one time
oh yeah okay cool cool

3198
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:57,760
oh yeah okay cool cool
 

3199
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,589
oh yeah okay cool cool
all right uh so in addition to this we

3200
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
all right uh so in addition to this we
 

3201
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:05,109
all right uh so in addition to this we
have a sequence aspect of our problem

3202
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:05,119

 

3203
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,150

right and for that uh maybe we'll use a

3204
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:08,160
right and for that uh maybe we'll use a
 

3205
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,109
right and for that uh maybe we'll use a
linked list right that's a pretty

3206
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
linked list right that's a pretty
 

3207
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,510
linked list right that's a pretty
reasonable sequence uh uh data structure

3208
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:13,520
reasonable sequence uh uh data structure
 

3209
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,069
reasonable sequence uh uh data structure
and in fact let's think for a second now

3210
00:58:16,069 --> 00:58:16,079
and in fact let's think for a second now
 

3211
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,910
and in fact let's think for a second now
we're gonna need this move below

3212
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:17,920
we're gonna need this move below
 

3213
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,349
we're gonna need this move below
operation right so our links list is

3214
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
operation right so our links list is
 

3215
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,870
operation right so our links list is
gonna store the order of the images in

3216
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:20,880
gonna store the order of the images in
 

3217
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,549
gonna store the order of the images in
our document

3218
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
our document
 

3219
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,910
our document
in order to move something below

3220
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:23,920
in order to move something below
 

3221
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,870
in order to move something below
something else we're going to kind of

3222
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:24,880
something else we're going to kind of
 

3223
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,710
something else we're going to kind of
splice an image in between two other

3224
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,720
splice an image in between two other
 

3225
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,549
splice an image in between two other
guys

3226
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
guys
 

3227
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,069
guys
so for convenience maybe we have a

3228
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
so for convenience maybe we have a
 

3229
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,510
so for convenience maybe we have a
doubly linked list so that we can like

3230
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,520
doubly linked list so that we can like
 

3231
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,190
doubly linked list so that we can like
move backward and forward so that we can

3232
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,200
move backward and forward so that we can
 

3233
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,309
move backward and forward so that we can
insert stuff

3234
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:34,319
insert stuff
 

3235
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:45,190
insert stuff
yeah so we'll have a doubly linked list

3236
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:45,200

 

3237
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,710

okay right so

3238
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
okay right so
 

3239
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,470
okay right so
let's start uh solving our problem and

3240
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:50,480
let's start uh solving our problem and
 

3241
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,870
let's start uh solving our problem and
then uh thinking about where uh things

3242
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
then uh thinking about where uh things
 

3243
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,069
then uh thinking about where uh things
are gonna go wrong here

3244
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:54,079
are gonna go wrong here
 

3245
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,789
are gonna go wrong here
uh with with our setup here so first of

3246
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
uh with with our setup here so first of
 

3247
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:57,750
uh with with our setup here so first of
all i don't think we really have to

3248
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:57,760
all i don't think we really have to
 

3249
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,630
all i don't think we really have to
write anything for the

3250
00:58:58,630 --> 00:58:58,640
write anything for the
 

3251
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,870
write anything for the
for for part one because making an empty

3252
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:00,880
for for part one because making an empty
 

3253
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,190
for for part one because making an empty
anything is a pretty easy algorithm

3254
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,200
anything is a pretty easy algorithm
 

3255
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,390
anything is a pretty easy algorithm
on your homework of course you should

3256
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,400
on your homework of course you should
 

3257
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,630
on your homework of course you should
write that and tell us that it takes

3258
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:06,640
write that and tell us that it takes
 

3259
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,549
write that and tell us that it takes
order one time

3260
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:08,559
order one time
 

3261
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,109
order one time
now how about uh importing an object

3262
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:11,119
now how about uh importing an object
 

3263
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,589
now how about uh importing an object
remember so that puts it on the top

3264
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:13,599
remember so that puts it on the top
 

3265
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,789
remember so that puts it on the top
of the uh it puts that on the top of our

3266
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:16,799
of the uh it puts that on the top of our
 

3267
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:17,750
of the uh it puts that on the top of our
linked list

3268
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:17,760
linked list
 

3269
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,349
linked list
and we have to insert it into our sorted

3270
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
and we have to insert it into our sorted
 

3271
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,270
and we have to insert it into our sorted
array

3272
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
array
 

3273
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,950
array
right so when we do that

3274
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:24,960
right so when we do that
 

3275
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,910
right so when we do that
[Applause]

3276
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:27,920
[Applause]
 

3277
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,109
[Applause]
our insert algorithm is super simple

3278
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:33,119
our insert algorithm is super simple
 

3279
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,789
our insert algorithm is super simple
right we're going to add

3280
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799

00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079
x to the set which we talked about in
 

3283
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,510
x to the set which we talked about in
class for a sorted array

3284
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:41,520
class for a sorted array
 

3285
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,109
class for a sorted array
how long does this take for a sorted

3286
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:43,119
how long does this take for a sorted
 

3287
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,390
how long does this take for a sorted
array to add something

3288
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
array to add something
 

3289
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,910
array to add something
exactly order end time but that's

3290
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:47,920
exactly order end time but that's
 

3291
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,670
exactly order end time but that's
actually okay because wait that's our

3292
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:49,680
actually okay because wait that's our
 

3293
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,870
actually okay because wait that's our
criterion for number two

3294
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:52,880

 

3295
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,349

yeah and in addition to that uh we'll

3296
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359
yeah and in addition to that uh we'll
 

3297
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,190
yeah and in addition to that uh we'll
put

3298
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200
put
 

3299
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,390
put
x on the top of the

3300
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:00,400
x on the top of the
 

3301
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,510
x on the top of the
the linked list

3302
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,520

 

3303
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,030

right let's order one time that's easy

3304
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,040
right let's order one time that's easy
 

3305
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,230
right let's order one time that's easy
i'm adding space because we're going to

3306
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:08,240
i'm adding space because we're going to
 

3307
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,670
i'm adding space because we're going to
see that we made a slight mistake and

3308
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:09,680
see that we made a slight mistake and
 

3309
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,789
see that we made a slight mistake and
that we're going to need to modify our

3310
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
that we're going to need to modify our
 

3311
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,829
that we're going to need to modify our
algorithm a tiny bit to solve this

3312
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:12,839
algorithm a tiny bit to solve this
 

3313
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:14,309
algorithm a tiny bit to solve this
problem

3314
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:14,319
problem
 

3315
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,870
problem
okay so how do we uh how do we display

3316
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:18,880
okay so how do we uh how do we display
 

3317
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,230
okay so how do we uh how do we display
i think that's the simplest one right

3318
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:20,240
i think that's the simplest one right
 

3319
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,589
i think that's the simplest one right
i'm just going to iterate over the

3320
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:21,599
i'm just going to iterate over the
 

3321
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,950
i'm just going to iterate over the
entire linked list and just

3322
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:22,960
entire linked list and just
 

3323
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,270
entire linked list and just
one by one output the order because

3324
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:25,280
one by one output the order because
 

3325
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,309
one by one output the order because
remember the whole point of the linked

3326
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:26,319
remember the whole point of the linked
 

3327
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,670
remember the whole point of the linked
list is to keep track of all of our

3328
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:27,680
list is to keep track of all of our
 

3329
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,549
list is to keep track of all of our
documents

3330
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:28,559
documents
 

3331
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,990
documents
in in order huh so uh

3332
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:32,000
in in order huh so uh
 

3333
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,109
in in order huh so uh
display

3334
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:35,119

 

3335
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,950

all you have to do is loop over

3336
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
all you have to do is loop over
 

3337
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,630
all you have to do is loop over
the linked list okay and the real kicker

3338
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:42,640
the linked list okay and the real kicker
 

3339
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,069
the linked list okay and the real kicker
is the last part right which is how do

3340
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,079
is the last part right which is how do
 

3341
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,430
is the last part right which is how do
you move something below

3342
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
you move something below
 

3343
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,950
you move something below
so so let's think for a minute what

3344
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:46,960
so so let's think for a minute what
 

3345
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,549
so so let's think for a minute what
what's what's moving below going to

3346
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:48,559
what's what's moving below going to
 

3347
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,870
what's what's moving below going to
entail

3348
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:50,880
entail
 

3349
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,030
entail
so is it going to affect the set of keys

3350
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,040
so is it going to affect the set of keys
 

3351
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,109
so is it going to affect the set of keys
that are in my document

3352
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,119
that are in my document
 

3353
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,630
that are in my document
no actually right they're just changing

3354
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:56,640
no actually right they're just changing
 

3355
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,990
no actually right they're just changing
their ordering but both of those keys

3356
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:58,000
their ordering but both of those keys
 

3357
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,910
their ordering but both of those keys
were already there

3358
01:00:59,910 --> 01:00:59,920
were already there
 

3359
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,190
were already there
yeah the only thing it's going to do

3360
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:03,200
yeah the only thing it's going to do
 

3361
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,789
yeah the only thing it's going to do
is affect where they are in the sequence

3362
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
is affect where they are in the sequence
 

3363
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,829
is affect where they are in the sequence
but there's something really really

3364
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:08,839
but there's something really really
 

3365
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:10,150
but there's something really really
annoying

3366
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,160
annoying
 

3367
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,750
annoying
how do i find something in this sequence

3368
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:11,760
how do i find something in this sequence
 

3369
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,030
how do i find something in this sequence
like let's say that i tell you the

3370
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:13,040
like let's say that i tell you the
 

3371
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,789
like let's say that i tell you the
document 75 has to move

3372
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:14,799
document 75 has to move
 

3373
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:18,390
document 75 has to move
below document 352.

3374
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,400
below document 352.
 

3375
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,630
below document 352.
well so far in my data structure what's

3376
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
well so far in my data structure what's
 

3377
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,270
well so far in my data structure what's
my only option

3378
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
my only option
 

3379
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,710
my only option
does the set tell me anything about

3380
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:24,720
does the set tell me anything about
 

3381
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,829
does the set tell me anything about
where stuff is in the links list

3382
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:27,839
where stuff is in the links list
 

3383
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,349
where stuff is in the links list
no so how much time is it going to take

3384
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:29,359
no so how much time is it going to take
 

3385
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,430
no so how much time is it going to take
for me to find a key

3386
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,440
for me to find a key
 

3387
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,190
for me to find a key
order n right because i've got a link i

3388
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,200
order n right because i've got a link i
 

3389
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,630
order n right because i've got a link i
gotta loop over this whole linked list

3390
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:34,640
gotta loop over this whole linked list
 

3391
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,030
gotta loop over this whole linked list
and and find the item that i'm missing

3392
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,040
and and find the item that i'm missing
 

3393
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,829
and and find the item that i'm missing
is that allowed no the problem tells me

3394
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:39,839
is that allowed no the problem tells me
 

3395
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,510
is that allowed no the problem tells me
that i have to do this in order

3396
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
that i have to do this in order
 

3397
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,829
that i have to do this in order
log and time so somehow on our head we

3398
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:43,839
log and time so somehow on our head we
 

3399
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:44,950
log and time so somehow on our head we
should be thinking like

3400
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:44,960
should be thinking like
 

3401
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,870
should be thinking like
okay we're gonna we want to kind of use

3402
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:46,880
okay we're gonna we want to kind of use
 

3403
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,630
okay we're gonna we want to kind of use
this set

3404
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:48,640
this set
 

3405
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,309
this set
here to help us find stuff in the doubly

does that make sense that intuition so

3410
01:01:56,069 --> 01:01:56,079
does that make sense that intuition so
 

3411
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,990
does that make sense that intuition so
here's how we're going to do it

3412
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,000
here's how we're going to do it
 

3413
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,430
here's how we're going to do it
actually before i do that any any ideas

3414
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
actually before i do that any any ideas
 

3415
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,829
actually before i do that any any ideas
how can we solve that

3416
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:04,839

 

3417
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:06,090

yes

3418
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:06,100
yes

that's a fabulous idea so here's what

3422
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680
that's a fabulous idea so here's what
 

3423
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,430
that's a fabulous idea so here's what
i'm going to do remember that when we

3424
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
i'm going to do remember that when we
 

3425
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,390
i'm going to do remember that when we
make a set we don't

3426
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:12,400
make a set we don't
 

3427
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,750
make a set we don't
have to store the keys we can attach

3428
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:13,760
have to store the keys we can attach
 

3429
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,710
have to store the keys we can attach
data to our keys yeah and in particular

3430
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:16,720
data to our keys yeah and in particular
 

3431
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,789
data to our keys yeah and in particular
i am going to attach a pointer

3432
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:20,799
i am going to attach a pointer
 

3433
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,190
i am going to attach a pointer
into my linked list it's a really sneaky

3434
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:23,200
into my linked list it's a really sneaky
 

3435
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,150
into my linked list it's a really sneaky
answer

3436
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,160
answer
 

3437
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,069
answer
yeah so let's say that i have let's do a

3438
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:26,079
yeah so let's say that i have let's do a
 

3439
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,829
yeah so let's say that i have let's do a
quick example so let's say that i have

3440
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:27,839
quick example so let's say that i have
 

3441
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,270
quick example so let's say that i have
my documents are

3442
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
my documents are
 

3443
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,029
my documents are
one five three two

3444
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:33,039
one five three two
 

3445
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,150
one five three two
and seven like that so my linked list is

3446
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:36,160
and seven like that so my linked list is
 

3447
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,349
and seven like that so my linked list is
gonna be real simple

3448
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:37,359
gonna be real simple
 

3449
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:38,710
gonna be real simple
it's doubly linked see there's two

3450
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
it's doubly linked see there's two
 

3451
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,630
it's doubly linked see there's two
arrows here

3452
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:40,640
arrows here
 

3453
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,910
arrows here
just like that right and now my sorted

3454
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:43,920
just like that right and now my sorted
 

3455
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,470
just like that right and now my sorted
array

3456
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:44,480
array
 

3457
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,430
array
is gonna store all the keys in order

3458
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
is gonna store all the keys in order
 

3459
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,870
is gonna store all the keys in order
let's see if i can do this with me one

3460
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:48,880
let's see if i can do this with me one
 

3461
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,349
let's see if i can do this with me one
two

3462
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:49,359
two
 

3463
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,029
two
three five seven all right so this is my

3464
01:02:53,029 --> 01:02:53,039
three five seven all right so this is my
 

3465
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,950
three five seven all right so this is my
this is my linked list

3466
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:54,960
this is my linked list
 

3467
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,190
this is my linked list
and here's my uh sorted array is going

3468
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:57,200
and here's my uh sorted array is going
 

3469
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,549
and here's my uh sorted array is going
to be one

3470
01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559
to be one
 

3471
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,309
to be one
two three five seven but then what i'm

3472
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:02,319
two three five seven but then what i'm
 

3473
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,470
two three five seven but then what i'm
going to attach to each of these guys

3474
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,480
going to attach to each of these guys
 

3475
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,069
going to attach to each of these guys
is a pointer to the element of the

3476
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:08,079
is a pointer to the element of the
 

3477
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,349
is a pointer to the element of the
linked list right so he

3478
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:09,359
linked list right so he
 

3479
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:10,789
linked list right so he
is going to additionally contain an

3480
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
is going to additionally contain an
 

3481
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:13,190
is going to additionally contain an
arrow here the two will contain an arrow

3482
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,200
arrow here the two will contain an arrow
 

3483
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:13,589
arrow here the two will contain an arrow
there

3484
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:13,599
there
 

3485
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,390
there
the three will contain an arrow there

3486
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
the three will contain an arrow there
 

3487
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,589
the three will contain an arrow there
the five

3488
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:17,599
the five
 

3489
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,430
the five
uh this is ugly i'm sorry

3490
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:21,440

 

3491
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,789

now here's the thing let's say that i

3492
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:22,799
now here's the thing let's say that i
 

3493
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,029
now here's the thing let's say that i
remove this three here

3494
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
remove this three here
 

3495
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,190
remove this three here
does that actually affect seven's

3496
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,200
does that actually affect seven's
 

3497
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,270
does that actually affect seven's
pointer

3498
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
pointer
 

3499
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,270
pointer
no right so these pointers remain valid

3500
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280
no right so these pointers remain valid
 

3501
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,870
no right so these pointers remain valid
even if i like edit other parts of the

3502
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
even if i like edit other parts of the
 

3503
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,510
even if i like edit other parts of the
list

3504
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:33,520
list
 

3505
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,950
list
really sneaky trick okay

3506
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
really sneaky trick okay
 

3507
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,390
really sneaky trick okay
so that is going to be our solution to

3508
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
so that is going to be our solution to
 

3509
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,990
so that is going to be our solution to
this problem is to store

3510
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:40,000
this problem is to store
 

3511
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,470
this problem is to store
not just assorted array of x's but x's

3512
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:42,480
not just assorted array of x's but x's
 

3513
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,430
not just assorted array of x's but x's
and

3514
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:43,440
and
 

3515
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,710
and
pointers so now we have to

3516
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720
pointers so now we have to
 

3517
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,230
pointers so now we have to
modify a tiny bit you're right

3518
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,240
modify a tiny bit you're right
 

3519
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,150
modify a tiny bit you're right
and now uh what can we do to move

3520
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,160
and now uh what can we do to move
 

3521
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,150
and now uh what can we do to move
something below

3522
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
something below
 

3523
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,510
something below
well it's going to happen in sort of

3524
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:55,520
well it's going to happen in sort of
 

3525
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,190
well it's going to happen in sort of
three steps right

3526
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
three steps right
 

3527
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,309
three steps right
so

3528
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:00,319

 

3529
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,230

our first step well we gotta first find

3530
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,240
our first step well we gotta first find
 

3531
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,589
our first step well we gotta first find
keys x and y

3532
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:03,599
keys x and y
 

3533
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,230
keys x and y
right so we're gonna find

3534
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,240
right so we're gonna find
 

3535
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,990
right so we're gonna find
x v x and

3536
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,000
x v x and
 

3537
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,190
x v x and
y v e y in

3538
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,200
y v e y in
 

3539
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,710
y v e y in
the set how long does this take

3540
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
the set how long does this take
 

3541
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,150
the set how long does this take
well now we can do it in binary search

3542
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
well now we can do it in binary search
 

3543
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:25,349
well now we can do it in binary search
right exactly so this is like oh

3544
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:25,359

 

3545
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:29,270

like that and now uh

3546
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,280
like that and now uh
 

3547
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,789
like that and now uh
what's my next step

3548
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:32,799

 

3549
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,870

well remember the move below operator

3550
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:34,880
well remember the move below operator
 

3551
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,069
well remember the move below operator
sort of removes

3552
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:36,079
sort of removes
 

3553
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:37,430
sort of removes
x from where it currently is and then

3554
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:37,440
x from where it currently is and then
 

3555
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,069
x from where it currently is and then
puts it underneath y

3556
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:40,079
puts it underneath y
 

3557
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,670
puts it underneath y
right and both of those are like linked

3558
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:41,680
right and both of those are like linked
 

3559
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,910
right and both of those are like linked
list editing operations right

3560
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:43,920
list editing operations right
 

3561
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,470
list editing operations right
so i'm going to kind of like you know if

3562
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:46,480
so i'm going to kind of like you know if
 

3563
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,190
so i'm going to kind of like you know if
i have a linked list

3564
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:49,200
i have a linked list
 

3565
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,470
i have a linked list
like one two three four

3566
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:52,480
like one two three four
 

3567
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,309
like one two three four
right and like let's say i want to erase

3568
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:54,319
right and like let's say i want to erase
 

3569
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:56,309
right and like let's say i want to erase
the two right i think you guys have all

3570
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:56,319
the two right i think you guys have all
 

3571
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,510
the two right i think you guys have all
coded this up at some point in your

3572
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,520
coded this up at some point in your
 

3573
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,190
coded this up at some point in your
lives then like what i'll do is

3574
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,200
lives then like what i'll do is
 

3575
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,589
lives then like what i'll do is
you know add links like that which i can

3576
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:01,599
you know add links like that which i can
 

3577
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:02,789
you know add links like that which i can
do because i can move forward and

3578
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:02,799
do because i can move forward and
 

3579
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,950
do because i can move forward and
backward in the list

3580
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:04,960
backward in the list
 

3581
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,390
backward in the list
right and similarly if i want to add

3582
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,400
right and similarly if i want to add
 

3583
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,670
right and similarly if i want to add
something then i'll like erase the links

3584
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
something then i'll like erase the links
 

3585
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,230
something then i'll like erase the links
put it in there and update the links

3586
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:10,240
put it in there and update the links
 

3587
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,029
put it in there and update the links
how much time does that take let's just

3588
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:13,039
how much time does that take let's just
 

3589
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,710
how much time does that take let's just
order one time right because now that i

3590
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:14,720
order one time right because now that i
 

3591
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,349
order one time right because now that i
have the pointers to these two locations

3592
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
have the pointers to these two locations
 

3593
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,710
have the pointers to these two locations
i'm just kind of like doing a lot of

3594
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,720
i'm just kind of like doing a lot of
 

3595
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,549
i'm just kind of like doing a lot of
rewiring in my my linked list but it's

3596
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:20,559
rewiring in my my linked list but it's
 

3597
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:21,750
rewiring in my my linked list but it's
all kind of local stuff

3598
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:21,760
all kind of local stuff
 

3599
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,270
all kind of local stuff
if you're coding in c this is where your

3600
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
if you're coding in c this is where your
 

3601
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,630
if you're coding in c this is where your
memory leak happens and your company

3602
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:24,640
memory leak happens and your company
 

3603
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,750
memory leak happens and your company
gets hacked

3604
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:25,760
gets hacked
 

3605
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,109
gets hacked
okay so uh right so that is uh what

3606
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:29,119
okay so uh right so that is uh what
 

3607
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,069
okay so uh right so that is uh what
we're gonna do next is update

3608
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:32,079
we're gonna do next is update
 

3609
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,990
we're gonna do next is update
the linked list and that takes order one

3610
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,000
the linked list and that takes order one
 

3611
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,829
the linked list and that takes order one
time on your homework if you're writing

3612
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:35,839
time on your homework if you're writing
 

3613
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:36,789
time on your homework if you're writing
out your answer you should have an

3614
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
out your answer you should have an
 

3615
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,150
out your answer you should have an
answer closer to what i've written on my

3616
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
answer closer to what i've written on my
 

3617
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:38,789
answer closer to what i've written on my
page

3618
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:38,799
page
 

3619
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,069
page
than the two words that i've written on

3620
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:40,079
than the two words that i've written on
 

3621
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,829
than the two words that i've written on
the board here

3622
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:41,839
the board here
 

3623
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:47,349
the board here
and then finally in step three

3624
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359

 

3625
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:48,390

well actually there is no step through

3626
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:48,400
well actually there is no step through
 

3627
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,029
well actually there is no step through
the way written in here sorry

3628
01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:51,039
the way written in here sorry
 

3629
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,549
the way written in here sorry
if we think of there there's actually

3630
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:52,559
if we think of there there's actually
 

3631
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:53,910
if we think of there there's actually
two sort of parts to updating the linked

3632
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:53,920
two sort of parts to updating the linked
 

3633
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,630
two sort of parts to updating the linked
list right

3634
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:54,640
list right
 

3635
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,750
list right
one is to remove

3636
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
one is to remove
 

3637
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,870
one is to remove
the old x uh position and then

3638
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:00,880
the old x uh position and then
 

3639
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,069
the old x uh position and then
insert in the proper position

3640
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
insert in the proper position
 

3641
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,270
insert in the proper position
right and when i do that my whole uh

3642
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,280
right and when i do that my whole uh
 

3643
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,349
right and when i do that my whole uh
my whole update happened notice that

3644
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:09,359
my whole update happened notice that
 

3645
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,390
my whole update happened notice that
there's something kind of interesting

3646
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
there's something kind of interesting
 

3647
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,069
there's something kind of interesting
about this move below operation

3648
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:12,079
about this move below operation
 

3649
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:13,589
about this move below operation
which is that did i actually edit the

3650
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:13,599
which is that did i actually edit the
 

3651
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,829
which is that did i actually edit the
set at all

3652
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:15,839
set at all
 

3653
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,029
set at all
no right that kind of makes sense

3654
01:06:17,029 --> 01:06:17,039
no right that kind of makes sense
 

3655
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,549
no right that kind of makes sense
because the set is just a set of keys in

3656
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:18,559
because the set is just a set of keys in
 

3657
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:19,589
because the set is just a set of keys in
my document

3658
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:19,599
my document
 

3659
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,109
my document
and just by changing the ordering it

3660
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:21,119
and just by changing the ordering it
 

3661
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,309
and just by changing the ordering it
doesn't affect what's what's in my

3662
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:22,319
doesn't affect what's what's in my
 

3663
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:23,670
doesn't affect what's what's in my
document so somehow it was a sanity

3664
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
document so somehow it was a sanity
 

3665
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,589
document so somehow it was a sanity
check that that works out

3666
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
check that that works out
 

3667
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,750
check that that works out
so this entire algorithm takes how long

3668
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
so this entire algorithm takes how long
 

3669
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,870
so this entire algorithm takes how long
well there's order

3670
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
well there's order
 

3671
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,630
well there's order
log n there's order one and there's

3672
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:30,640
log n there's order one and there's
 

3673
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,990
log n there's order one and there's
another order one

3674
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:32,000
another order one
 

3675
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,230
another order one
so the whole thing is log n and life is

3676
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
so the whole thing is log n and life is
 

3677
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,670
so the whole thing is log n and life is
good for our problem here

3678
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:35,680
good for our problem here
 

3679
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,470
good for our problem here
yes um so how can we input such pointers

3680
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:38,480
yes um so how can we input such pointers
 

3681
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,270
yes um so how can we input such pointers
in real life

3682
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
in real life
 

3683
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,829
in real life
how do we input such points like a set

3684
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:41,839
how do we input such points like a set
 

3685
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:42,870
how do we input such points like a set
with pointers

3686
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:42,880
with pointers
 

3687
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,589
with pointers
in real life got it so i only know the c

3688
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
in real life got it so i only know the c
 

3689
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,029
in real life got it so i only know the c
plus version of this i'm going to get it

3690
01:06:47,029 --> 01:06:47,039
plus version of this i'm going to get it
 

3691
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,309
plus version of this i'm going to get it
wrong for python

3692
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:48,319
wrong for python
 

3693
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,950
wrong for python
um but i'm not sure that i quite

3694
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
um but i'm not sure that i quite
 

3695
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,829
um but i'm not sure that i quite
understand the question so

3696
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:51,839
understand the question so
 

3697
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,029
understand the question so
it's just like pointers anywhere else in

3698
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
it's just like pointers anywhere else in
 

3699
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,510
it's just like pointers anywhere else in
real life uh so i guess in in in python

3700
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:55,520
real life uh so i guess in in in python
 

3701
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,230
real life uh so i guess in in in python
you know

3702
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:56,240
you know
 

3703
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,549
you know
um what you'll do is you'll create a new

3704
01:06:58,549 --> 01:06:58,559
um what you'll do is you'll create a new
 

3705
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,069
um what you'll do is you'll create a new
right as you add these guys to your set

3706
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:00,079
right as you add these guys to your set
 

3707
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,910
right as you add these guys to your set
you'll create a new object here

3708
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:01,920
you'll create a new object here
 

3709
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,950
you'll create a new object here
and in addition to that you're going to

3710
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:02,960
and in addition to that you're going to
 

3711
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,549
and in addition to that you're going to
create a new vx that you add to the

3712
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:04,559
create a new vx that you add to the
 

3713
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,670
create a new vx that you add to the
linked list

3714
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:05,680
linked list
 

3715
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,029
linked list
and then the pointer is just an address

3716
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:07,039
and then the pointer is just an address
 

3717
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,710
and then the pointer is just an address
in memory right so

3718
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:08,720
in memory right so
 

3719
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,109
in memory right so
essentially what you'll store notes are

3720
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:11,119
essentially what you'll store notes are
 

3721
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:11,990
essentially what you'll store notes are
the

3722
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,000
the
 

3723
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,270
the
are the second l the pointers are pairs

3724
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,280
are the second l the pointers are pairs
 

3725
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,630
are the second l the pointers are pairs
they're a pair of an x value uh and a

3726
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:18,640
they're a pair of an x value uh and a
 

3727
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,510
they're a pair of an x value uh and a
oh i'm sorry yeah actually i guess this

3728
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:21,520
oh i'm sorry yeah actually i guess this
 

3729
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:21,829
oh i'm sorry yeah actually i guess this
right

3730
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:21,839
right
 

3731
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,910
right
um no the linked list just contains a

3732
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
um no the linked list just contains a
 

3733
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,029
um no the linked list just contains a
long list of x's

3734
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:27,039
long list of x's
 

3735
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,270
long list of x's
right um but they don't have to be in

3736
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
right um but they don't have to be in
 

3737
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,710
right um but they don't have to be in
contiguous memory that's the only

3738
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
contiguous memory that's the only
 

3739
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,990
contiguous memory that's the only
difference so you make them one

3740
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,000
difference so you make them one
 

3741
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,510
difference so you make them one
linked list item at a time but it's just

3742
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:33,520
linked list item at a time but it's just
 

3743
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,870
linked list item at a time but it's just
like constructing any other linked list

3744
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:34,880
like constructing any other linked list
 

3745
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,270
like constructing any other linked list
yeah

3746
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:35,280
yeah
 

3747
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,789
yeah
in fact there's pseudo code in the uh

3748
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
in fact there's pseudo code in the uh
 

3749
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,630
in fact there's pseudo code in the uh
the solutions that are are

3750
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:38,640
the solutions that are are
 

3751
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,390
the solutions that are are
distributed so you can take a look there

3752
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,400
distributed so you can take a look there
 

3753
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,710
distributed so you can take a look there
yeah speaking of which um for these

3754
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:42,720
yeah speaking of which um for these
 

3755
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,470
yeah speaking of which um for these
for like implementing these database

3756
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:44,480
for like implementing these database
 

3757
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,390
for like implementing these database
operations can we pseudo code the

3758
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:46,400
operations can we pseudo code the
 

3759
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,069
operations can we pseudo code the
like algorithms for them i think the

3760
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:48,079
like algorithms for them i think the
 

3761
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,430
like algorithms for them i think the
official answer is no

3762
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
official answer is no
 

3763
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,950
official answer is no
that you really are supposed to write

3764
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:50,960
that you really are supposed to write
 

3765
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,470
that you really are supposed to write
out in words what your your thing is

3766
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:52,480
out in words what your your thing is
 

3767
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:52,950
out in words what your your thing is
doing

3768
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:52,960
doing
 

3769
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,549
doing
now there's a weird gray area of course

3770
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:54,559
now there's a weird gray area of course
 

3771
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:55,750
now there's a weird gray area of course
which is that the words that you write

3772
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:55,760
which is that the words that you write
 

3773
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,029
which is that the words that you write
are going to look an awful lot like

3774
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:57,039
are going to look an awful lot like
 

3775
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,470
are going to look an awful lot like
pseudo code

3776
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
pseudo code
 

3777
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,549
pseudo code
but uh you you should make an effort to

3778
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
but uh you you should make an effort to
 

3779
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:01,430
but uh you you should make an effort to
try and write down a little bit in

3780
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:01,440
try and write down a little bit in
 

3781
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,470
try and write down a little bit in
paragraph form and b

3782
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:02,480
paragraph form and b
 

3783
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,829
paragraph form and b
be descriptive about it this is a good

3784
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:03,839
be descriptive about it this is a good
 

3785
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,270
be descriptive about it this is a good
skill to learn at the beginning of this

3786
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:05,280
skill to learn at the beginning of this
 

3787
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,870
skill to learn at the beginning of this
course i think it's it's

3788
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:06,880
course i think it's it's
 

3789
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,630
course i think it's it's
it'll feel a little pedantic at points

3790
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:08,640
it'll feel a little pedantic at points
 

3791
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,470
it'll feel a little pedantic at points
and and that's good because it

3792
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,480
and and that's good because it
 

3793
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,589
and and that's good because it
should and you should deal with it yeah

3794
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:13,599
should and you should deal with it yeah
 

3795
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,430
should and you should deal with it yeah
no but really yeah try and write things

3796
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:15,440
no but really yeah try and write things
 

3797
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,189
no but really yeah try and write things
out in a way that like

3798
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:17,199
out in a way that like
 

3799
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:18,550
out in a way that like
captures your logic rather than just

3800
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
captures your logic rather than just
 

3801
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,749
captures your logic rather than just
like python code yeah

3802
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:21,759
like python code yeah
 

3803
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:23,669
like python code yeah
cool all right so let's see we've got

3804
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
cool all right so let's see we've got
 

3805
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,910
cool all right so let's see we've got
we've got approximately 17

3806
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:25,920
we've got approximately 17
 

3807
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,070
we've got approximately 17
minutes left in class which is

3808
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,080
minutes left in class which is
 

3809
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,430
minutes left in class which is
approximately one-eighth of the time it

3810
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:29,440
approximately one-eighth of the time it
 

3811
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,870
approximately one-eighth of the time it
took me to figure out the solution to

3812
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:30,880
took me to figure out the solution to
 

3813
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,149
took me to figure out the solution to
this last homework problem

3814
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
this last homework problem
 

3815
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,669
this last homework problem
but we'll get started uh and i've

3816
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
but we'll get started uh and i've
 

3817
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,349
but we'll get started uh and i've
written out a careful answer

3818
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:35,359
written out a careful answer
 

3819
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,510
written out a careful answer
um because essentially in problem four

3820
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:39,520
um because essentially in problem four
 

3821
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,030
um because essentially in problem four
i found myself getting stuck in a few

3822
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040
i found myself getting stuck in a few
 

3823
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,630
i found myself getting stuck in a few
little details and so i figured the way

3824
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:42,640
little details and so i figured the way
 

3825
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,309
little details and so i figured the way
that i'd write out my little

3826
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
that i'd write out my little
 

3827
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,990
that i'd write out my little
hand scribbled chicken scratch answer

3828
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,000
hand scribbled chicken scratch answer
 

3829
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,189
hand scribbled chicken scratch answer
online was to just basically give you

3830
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:49,199
online was to just basically give you
 

3831
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,990
online was to just basically give you
an internal dialogue of my brain and how

3832
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
an internal dialogue of my brain and how
 

3833
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,510
an internal dialogue of my brain and how
i went about solving these things and

3834
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:53,520
i went about solving these things and
 

3835
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,669
i went about solving these things and
all the stupid missteps that i made

3836
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:55,679
all the stupid missteps that i made
 

3837
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,269
all the stupid missteps that i made
yeah um because i think that's actually

3838
01:08:57,269 --> 01:08:57,279
yeah um because i think that's actually
 

3839
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,269
yeah um because i think that's actually
quite valuable essentially it's often

3840
01:08:59,269 --> 01:08:59,279
quite valuable essentially it's often
 

3841
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,470
quite valuable essentially it's often
you see in these problem sessions just

3842
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:00,480
you see in these problem sessions just
 

3843
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,349
you see in these problem sessions just
like oh here's a problem here's the

3844
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:01,359
like oh here's a problem here's the
 

3845
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,229
like oh here's a problem here's the
answer here's a problem here's the

3846
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:02,239
answer here's a problem here's the
 

3847
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:02,789
answer here's a problem here's the
answer

3848
01:09:02,789 --> 01:09:02,799
answer
 

3849
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:04,470
answer
but the reality is even your professor

3850
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:04,480
but the reality is even your professor
 

3851
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,669
but the reality is even your professor
especially because he's used to thinking

3852
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:05,679
especially because he's used to thinking
 

3853
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:05,990
especially because he's used to thinking
about

3854
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,000
about
 

3855
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,390
about
rendering um occasionally gets confused

3856
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:08,400
rendering um occasionally gets confused
 

3857
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,189
rendering um occasionally gets confused
about these

3858
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
about these
 

3859
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,030
about these
these algorithms problems especially

3860
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040
these algorithms problems especially
 

3861
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,709
these algorithms problems especially
when they're frankly written in a bit of

3862
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:12,719
when they're frankly written in a bit of
 

3863
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:13,430
when they're frankly written in a bit of
a

3864
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,440
a
 

3865
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,669
a
confusing way uh and i heard some some

3866
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:15,679
confusing way uh and i heard some some
 

3867
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:17,189
confusing way uh and i heard some some
war stories about this problem actually

3868
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
war stories about this problem actually
 

3869
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:18,950
war stories about this problem actually
being on the homework apparently i i'm

3870
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
being on the homework apparently i i'm
 

3871
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,630
being on the homework apparently i i'm
in good company

3872
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:20,640
in good company
 

3873
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,990
in good company
so let's take a look at this last

3874
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:22,000
so let's take a look at this last
 

3875
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,630
so let's take a look at this last
homework problem 1-4 so this is on brick

3876
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:24,640
homework problem 1-4 so this is on brick
 

3877
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,229
homework problem 1-4 so this is on brick
blowing and this is a great exercise in

3878
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:28,239
blowing and this is a great exercise in
 

3879
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:28,789
blowing and this is a great exercise in
taking

3880
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
taking
 

3881
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,870
taking
a problem that is described in really

3882
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:30,880
a problem that is described in really
 

3883
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,789
a problem that is described in really
long nasty useless language and then

3884
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:32,799
long nasty useless language and then
 

3885
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,070
long nasty useless language and then
extracting like the two words that

3886
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:34,080
extracting like the two words that
 

3887
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,349
extracting like the two words that
matter

3888
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:35,359
matter
 

3889
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,189
matter
um by the way like i'm making a joke

3890
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
um by the way like i'm making a joke
 

3891
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:38,789
um by the way like i'm making a joke
about that i can tell you that about 82

3892
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
about that i can tell you that about 82
 

3893
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,390
about that i can tell you that about 82
percent of my time as a professor is

3894
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:40,400
percent of my time as a professor is
 

3895
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,829
percent of my time as a professor is
spent with like people from industry

3896
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:41,839
spent with like people from industry
 

3897
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,349
spent with like people from industry
visiting my office with exactly this

3898
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:43,359
visiting my office with exactly this
 

3899
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:44,870
visiting my office with exactly this
kind of scenario where like

3900
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
kind of scenario where like
 

3901
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,749
kind of scenario where like
you know they have some really

3902
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:45,759
you know they have some really
 

3903
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,030
you know they have some really
complicated thing they've been thinking

3904
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
complicated thing they've been thinking
 

3905
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,309
complicated thing they've been thinking
about their

3906
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:48,319
about their
 

3907
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:49,990
about their
you know construction problem for like

3908
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,000
you know construction problem for like
 

3909
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,189
you know construction problem for like
years and they have all these details

3910
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:51,199
years and they have all these details
 

3911
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:52,390
years and they have all these details
and tables and flow charts and then it

3912
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
and tables and flow charts and then it
 

3913
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,990
and tables and flow charts and then it
turns out that their problem is like

3914
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
turns out that their problem is like
 

3915
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,590
turns out that their problem is like
can be captured in about two sentences

3916
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:55,600
can be captured in about two sentences
 

3917
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,070
can be captured in about two sentences
but so it's a good skill to have and one

3918
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
but so it's a good skill to have and one
 

3919
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,430
but so it's a good skill to have and one
that can get you a lot of money as a

3920
01:09:59,430 --> 01:09:59,440
that can get you a lot of money as a
 

3921
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,550
that can get you a lot of money as a
consultant

3922
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:00,560
consultant
 

3923
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,830
consultant
so it's one that's worth practicing in

3924
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:01,840
so it's one that's worth practicing in
 

3925
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,590
so it's one that's worth practicing in
this class even if we're doing it for

3926
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
this class even if we're doing it for
 

3927
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,870
this class even if we're doing it for
pork

3928
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:04,880
pork
 

3929
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,630
pork
pork land with a wolf that blows only to

3930
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
pork land with a wolf that blows only to
 

3931
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,149
pork land with a wolf that blows only to
the east

3932
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,159
the east
 

3933
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:11,750
the east
okay so what's going on in this problem

3934
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:11,760
okay so what's going on in this problem
 

3935
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,510
okay so what's going on in this problem
there's there's a wolf and the wolf can

3936
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:13,520
there's there's a wolf and the wolf can
 

3937
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,270
there's there's a wolf and the wolf can
blow on houses

3938
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280
blow on houses
 

3939
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,990
blow on houses
but for some reason um the wolf likes to

3940
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
but for some reason um the wolf likes to
 

3941
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,270
but for some reason um the wolf likes to
blow to the right

3942
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:19,280
blow to the right
 

3943
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,470
blow to the right
and to make matters even more

3944
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:20,480
and to make matters even more
 

3945
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,070
and to make matters even more
complicated whoever wrote this problem

3946
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:22,080
complicated whoever wrote this problem
 

3947
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,590
complicated whoever wrote this problem
occasionally ordered things from east to

at the time that i would have at least
gotten rid of

01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:29,600
gotten rid of
 

3959
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,950

that's just that's just mean um but in

3960
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
that's just that's just mean um but in
 

3961
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,590
that's just that's just mean um but in
any event

story that we all know and love from our

3970
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:42,880
story that we all know and love from our
 

3971
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,669
story that we all know and love from our
childhood is uh

3972
01:10:45,669 --> 01:10:45,679
childhood is uh
 

3973
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,350
childhood is uh
there's a row of houses each of which

3974
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:47,360
there's a row of houses each of which
 

3975
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,350
there's a row of houses each of which
has a different number of bricks

3976
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,360
has a different number of bricks
 

3977
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,470
has a different number of bricks
yeah and now there's a wind

3978
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:52,480
yeah and now there's a wind
 

3979
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,270
yeah and now there's a wind
which is blowing from west to east i

3980
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:55,280
which is blowing from west to east i
 

3981
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,790
which is blowing from west to east i
remember all this because i was staring

3982
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:56,800
remember all this because i was staring
 

3983
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,550
remember all this because i was staring
at it this morning in my office

3984
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
at it this morning in my office
 

3985
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,910
at it this morning in my office
and essentially the wolf being the the

3986
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:01,920
and essentially the wolf being the the
 

3987
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,430
and essentially the wolf being the the
big bad wolf that he is

3988
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
big bad wolf that he is
 

3989
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,870
big bad wolf that he is
says aha if i to blow from west to east

3990
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,880
says aha if i to blow from west to east
 

3991
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,550
says aha if i to blow from west to east
i can knock over more houses more

3992
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:08,560
i can knock over more houses more
 

3993
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,310
i can knock over more houses more
efficiently

3994
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:10,320
efficiently
 

3995
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,229
efficiently
yeah because i'm the wind is helping me

3996
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:12,239
yeah because i'm the wind is helping me
 

3997
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,430
yeah because i'm the wind is helping me
you don't want to blow into the wind

3998
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:13,440
you don't want to blow into the wind
 

3999
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,950
you don't want to blow into the wind
it gets you know you're spitting your

4000
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:14,960
it gets you know you're spitting your
 

4001
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,550
it gets you know you're spitting your
face okay so uh the wolf does that

4002
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:18,560
face okay so uh the wolf does that
 

4003
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,270
face okay so uh the wolf does that
and then what happens is that the wolf

4004
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:21,280
and then what happens is that the wolf
 

4005
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,070
and then what happens is that the wolf
not only

4006
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,080
not only
 

4007
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,070
not only
knocks down the house upon which the

4008
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,080
knocks down the house upon which the
 

4009
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,510
knocks down the house upon which the
wolf blows

4010
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:25,520
wolf blows
 

4011
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,990
wolf blows
but also all the houses to the east of

4012
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
but also all the houses to the east of
 

4013
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,030
but also all the houses to the east of
that house

4014
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
that house
 

4015
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,229
that house
that have fewer bricks

4016
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:32,239
that have fewer bricks
 

4017
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,310
that have fewer bricks
why you might ask i don't know because

4018
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
why you might ask i don't know because
 

4019
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,750
why you might ask i don't know because
whoever wrote this problem was being a

4020
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
whoever wrote this problem was being a
 

4021
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,390
whoever wrote this problem was being a
goofball

4022
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:36,400
goofball
 

4023
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,830
goofball
but that's the basic setup of this

4024
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:37,840
but that's the basic setup of this
 

4025
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,830
but that's the basic setup of this
problem and you can see that essentially

4026
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:39,840
problem and you can see that essentially
 

4027
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,590
problem and you can see that essentially
this is just a long convoluted way of

4028
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:41,600
this is just a long convoluted way of
 

4029
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,550
this is just a long convoluted way of
describing something pretty

4030
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:42,560
describing something pretty
 

4031
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,510
describing something pretty
straightforward

4032
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:43,520
straightforward
 

4033
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,750
straightforward
yeah and so at the end of the day the

4034
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:45,760
yeah and so at the end of the day the
 

4035
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,910
yeah and so at the end of the day the
wolf being kind of an adversarial

4036
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:47,920
wolf being kind of an adversarial
 

4037
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,750
wolf being kind of an adversarial
uh wolf wants to blow down as many

4038
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:49,760
uh wolf wants to blow down as many
 

4039
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,669
uh wolf wants to blow down as many
bricks as possible and we are providing

4040
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:51,679
bricks as possible and we are providing
 

4041
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,189
bricks as possible and we are providing
the wolf with the analytical tools

4042
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:53,199
the wolf with the analytical tools
 

4043
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:54,870
the wolf with the analytical tools
needed to do so

4044
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:54,880
needed to do so
 

4045
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,790
needed to do so
yeah so in case you didn't think we

4046
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
yeah so in case you didn't think we
 

4047
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,030
yeah so in case you didn't think we
covered anything practical in 6006

4048
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,040
covered anything practical in 6006
 

4049
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,669
covered anything practical in 6006
uh now you know that we we actually are

4050
01:12:01,669 --> 01:12:01,679
uh now you know that we we actually are
 

4051
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,030
uh now you know that we we actually are
doing state-of-the-art

4052
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,040
doing state-of-the-art
 

4053
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,830
doing state-of-the-art
wolf brick blowing pig analysis okay so

4054
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:06,840
wolf brick blowing pig analysis okay so
 

4055
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,790
wolf brick blowing pig analysis okay so
uh

4056
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:08,800
uh
 

4057
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,390
uh
right so let's uh let's do an example

4058
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:10,400
right so let's uh let's do an example
 

4059
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,950
right so let's uh let's do an example
because this is like weirdly complicated

4060
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:12,960
because this is like weirdly complicated
 

4061
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,350
because this is like weirdly complicated
so the first part of the problem asks

4062
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
so the first part of the problem asks
 

4063
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,790
so the first part of the problem asks
you to just do an example out and i

4064
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:16,800
you to just do an example out and i
 

4065
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,590
you to just do an example out and i
think

4066
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:17,600
think
 

4067
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,350
think
if i were psychologically diagnosing the

4068
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:19,360
if i were psychologically diagnosing the
 

4069
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,870
if i were psychologically diagnosing the
person who wrote this problem probably

4070
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:20,880
person who wrote this problem probably
 

4071
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,310
person who wrote this problem probably
the reason is that they stood back and

4072
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
the reason is that they stood back and
 

4073
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,590
the reason is that they stood back and
they said nobody's going to understand

4074
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:23,600
they said nobody's going to understand
 

4075
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,070
they said nobody's going to understand
this

4076
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
this
 

4077
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,990
this
unless i force them to do an example by

4078
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,000
unless i force them to do an example by
 

4079
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,510
unless i force them to do an example by
hand

4080
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:27,520
hand
 

4081
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,870
hand
right and so the basic problem is asking

4082
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880
right and so the basic problem is asking
 

4083
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,590
right and so the basic problem is asking
like you know i could choose to blow

4084
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:31,600
like you know i could choose to blow
 

4085
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,990
like you know i could choose to blow
on each house which one should i choose

4086
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,000
on each house which one should i choose
 

4087
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,229
on each house which one should i choose
to cause the most damage

4088
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
to cause the most damage
 

4089
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,830
to cause the most damage
or in fact they actually ask a slightly

4090
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:37,840
or in fact they actually ask a slightly
 

4091
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,590
or in fact they actually ask a slightly
different problem which is if i were to

4092
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
different problem which is if i were to
 

4093
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,510
different problem which is if i were to
blow on each house how much damage would

4094
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
blow on each house how much damage would
 

4095
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,270
blow on each house how much damage would
i cause

4096
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
i cause
 

4097
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,630
i cause
okay so let's step through the problem

4098
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:44,640
okay so let's step through the problem
 

4099
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,630
okay so let's step through the problem
so they give you an example uh

4100
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
so they give you an example uh
 

4101
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,229
so they give you an example uh
a set of numbers 34

4102
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:50,239
a set of numbers 34
 

4103
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:54,950
a set of numbers 34
57 70

4104
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960
57 70
 

4105
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,470
57 70
19 48

4106
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,480
19 48
 

4107
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,510
19 48
actually let's just stop there i don't

4108
01:12:59,510 --> 01:12:59,520
actually let's just stop there i don't
 

4109
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,550
actually let's just stop there i don't
think there's any reason to do like a

4110
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,560
think there's any reason to do like a
 

4111
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,070
think there's any reason to do like a
list of a million numbers like in the

4112
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080
list of a million numbers like in the
 

4113
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,430
list of a million numbers like in the
problem that was just like

4114
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
problem that was just like
 

4115
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,470
problem that was just like
you know the more times you do it the

4116
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:04,480
you know the more times you do it the
 

4117
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,990
you know the more times you do it the
more you convince yourself how useless

4118
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:06,000
more you convince yourself how useless
 

4119
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,430
more you convince yourself how useless
6006 is

4120
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
6006 is
 

4121
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,990
6006 is
okay so so uh right so so how much

4122
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
okay so so uh right so so how much
 

4123
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,709
okay so so uh right so so how much
damage

4124
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
damage
 

4125
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,590
damage
does blowing on house number one cause

4126
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:13,600
does blowing on house number one cause
 

4127
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,270
does blowing on house number one cause
well let's make a little table so if i

4128
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,280
well let's make a little table so if i
 

4129
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,790
well let's make a little table so if i
blow on house number one

4130
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:16,800
blow on house number one
 

4131
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,669
blow on house number one
just by default house number one false

4132
01:13:19,669 --> 01:13:19,679
just by default house number one false
 

4133
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,070
just by default house number one false
i'll pull x there meaning i blew it over

4134
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,080
i'll pull x there meaning i blew it over
 

4135
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,070
i'll pull x there meaning i blew it over
and then the rule is any house to the

4136
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:24,080
and then the rule is any house to the
 

4137
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,189
and then the rule is any house to the
right which has

4138
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:25,199
right which has
 

4139
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,669
right which has
fewer bricks the physics of this problem

4140
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:27,679
fewer bricks the physics of this problem
 

4141
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:28,950
fewer bricks the physics of this problem
drives me nuts i thought about it for

4142
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
drives me nuts i thought about it for
 

4143
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,229
drives me nuts i thought about it for
quite a long time and i

4144
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:30,239
quite a long time and i
 

4145
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,669
quite a long time and i
i can't think of a wind that actually

4146
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
i can't think of a wind that actually
 

4147
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,870
i can't think of a wind that actually
has this property uh but any house

4148
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:34,880
has this property uh but any house
 

4149
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,030
has this property uh but any house
that has fewer bricks and is to the east

4150
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:37,040
that has fewer bricks and is to the east
 

4151
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,310
that has fewer bricks and is to the east
also gets blown down so

4152
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:38,320
also gets blown down so
 

4153
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,350
also gets blown down so
57 does not right that's bigger than 34.

4154
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:41,360
57 does not right that's bigger than 34.
 

4155
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,110
57 does not right that's bigger than 34.
similarly for 70. aha the 19 goes

4156
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
similarly for 70. aha the 19 goes
 

4157
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,990
similarly for 70. aha the 19 goes
with the wind uh 48's bigger and the two

4158
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:48,000
with the wind uh 48's bigger and the two
 

4159
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,709
with the wind uh 48's bigger and the two
goes

4160
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:48,719
goes
 

4161
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,470
goes
right so the element number one of my

4162
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:50,480
right so the element number one of my
 

4163
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,310
right so the element number one of my
array would be three

4164
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,320
array would be three
 

4165
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,510
array would be three
right three things get blown over

4166
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
right three things get blown over
 

4167
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,310
right three things get blown over
okay for the next guy right so the 57

4168
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:58,320
okay for the next guy right so the 57
 

4169
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,189
okay for the next guy right so the 57
gets blown over

4170
01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,199
gets blown over
 

4171
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,750
gets blown over
it does not blow over the 34 because my

4172
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:01,760
it does not blow over the 34 because my
 

4173
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,030
it does not blow over the 34 because my
wolf only knows how to blow to the right

4174
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:05,040
wolf only knows how to blow to the right
 

4175
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,149
wolf only knows how to blow to the right
uh so

4176
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:08,159
uh so
 

4177
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,830
uh so
it does not blow over the 70 it does

4178
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:09,840
it does not blow over the 70 it does
 

4179
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,510
it does not blow over the 70 it does
blow over the 19

4180
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
blow over the 19
 

4181
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,990
blow over the 19
doesn't blow it does move over the 48 it

4182
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,000
doesn't blow it does move over the 48 it
 

4183
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,870
doesn't blow it does move over the 48 it
does

4184
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
does
 

4185
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,030
does
right so here there'll be a four these

4186
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:17,040
right so here there'll be a four these
 

4187
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,550
right so here there'll be a four these
numbers do not match the ones in the

4188
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:18,560
numbers do not match the ones in the
 

4189
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,229
numbers do not match the ones in the
notes because this is a shorter list of

4190
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
notes because this is a shorter list of
 

4191
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:20,709
notes because this is a shorter list of
numbers

4192
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:20,719
numbers
 

4193
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,870
numbers
i should point out okay let's do one

4194
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:22,880
i should point out okay let's do one
 

4195
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,669
i should point out okay let's do one
more and then we're going to stop

4196
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:23,679
more and then we're going to stop
 

4197
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:25,590
more and then we're going to stop
because this is laborious and boring

4198
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:25,600
because this is laborious and boring
 

4199
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,709
because this is laborious and boring
so the 70 blows over everything

4200
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:28,719
so the 70 blows over everything
 

4201
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,990
so the 70 blows over everything
yeah but only everything to

4202
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,000
yeah but only everything to
 

4203
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,470
yeah but only everything to
it's right because as we all know holes

4204
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
it's right because as we all know holes
 

4205
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,910
it's right because as we all know holes
only blow to there okay i'll shut up

4206
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:35,920
only blow to there okay i'll shut up
 

4207
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,790
only blow to there okay i'll shut up
uh so there's uh there's four uh there's

4208
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:38,800
uh so there's uh there's four uh there's
 

4209
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,149
uh so there's uh there's four uh there's
four things that get blown over here but

4210
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:40,159
four things that get blown over here but
 

4211
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,070
four things that get blown over here but
you guys get the point right and so

4212
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
you guys get the point right and so
 

4213
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,430
you guys get the point right and so
essentially this problem is asking you

4214
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
essentially this problem is asking you
 

4215
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,590
essentially this problem is asking you
to fill in arrays that look like this

4216
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600
to fill in arrays that look like this
 

4217
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,390
to fill in arrays that look like this
for your problem everybody on board with

4218
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:48,400
for your problem everybody on board with
 

4219
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,430
for your problem everybody on board with
the problem

4220
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:49,440
the problem
 

4221
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,189
the problem
now notice that just by virtue of doing

4222
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
now notice that just by virtue of doing
 

4223
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,110
now notice that just by virtue of doing
this example let's think about this

4224
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
this example let's think about this
 

4225
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,390
this example let's think about this
abstractly because i think this is a

4226
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,400
abstractly because i think this is a
 

4227
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,149
abstractly because i think this is a
problem that's just coded in so many

4228
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:56,159
problem that's just coded in so many
 

4229
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,470
problem that's just coded in so many
words and made up like weird ta garbage

4230
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480
words and made up like weird ta garbage
 

4231
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,870
words and made up like weird ta garbage
but like at the end of the day like this

4232
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:00,880
but like at the end of the day like this
 

4233
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,390
but like at the end of the day like this
problem as an algorithmic problem is not

4234
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
problem as an algorithmic problem is not
 

4235
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,270
problem as an algorithmic problem is not
so bad

4236
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
so bad
 

4237
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,790
so bad
right essentially what i'm asking you to

4238
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
right essentially what i'm asking you to
 

4239
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,270
right essentially what i'm asking you to
do is i look at that 57

4240
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,280
do is i look at that 57
 

4241
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,550
do is i look at that 57
and i look to the right and i count how

4242
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,560
and i look to the right and i count how
 

4243
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,550
and i look to the right and i count how
many things are smaller than 57

4244
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,560
many things are smaller than 57
 

4245
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,149
many things are smaller than 57
and i add one to it and that's the

4246
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
and i add one to it and that's the
 

4247
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,430
and i add one to it and that's the
number that should go in that element of

4248
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,440
number that should go in that element of
 

4249
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,709
number that should go in that element of
the array

4250
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719
the array
 

4251
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:15,750
the array
so notice that like those three

4252
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:15,760
so notice that like those three
 

4253
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,630
so notice that like those three
paragraphs that's what they're

4254
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:16,640
paragraphs that's what they're
 

4255
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,750
paragraphs that's what they're
communicating you didn't need like

4256
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
communicating you didn't need like

communicating you didn't need like
wolves blowing and winds and and trees

4258
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:19,840
wolves blowing and winds and and trees
 

4259
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,189
wolves blowing and winds and and trees
and houses and

4260
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:21,199
and houses and
 

4261
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,350
and houses and
dorothy and all that kind of stuff yeah

4262
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
dorothy and all that kind of stuff yeah
 

4263
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,669
dorothy and all that kind of stuff yeah
so uh right so so at the end of the day

4264
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:25,679
so uh right so so at the end of the day
 

4265
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:26,709
so uh right so so at the end of the day
that's the problem we can think about

4266
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:26,719
that's the problem we can think about
 

4267
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:27,910
that's the problem we can think about
and we no longer have to think about

4268
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:27,920
and we no longer have to think about
 

4269
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,229
and we no longer have to think about
pork land ever again

4270
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:30,239
pork land ever again
 

4271
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,229
pork land ever again
okay so maybe in the in the remaining 10

4272
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:32,239
okay so maybe in the in the remaining 10
 

4273
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:33,830
okay so maybe in the in the remaining 10
minutes here i think we can feasibly do

4274
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
minutes here i think we can feasibly do
 

4275
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,790
minutes here i think we can feasibly do
part b

4276
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
part b
 

4277
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,350
part b
uh and then part c is a sort of an

4278
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,360
uh and then part c is a sort of an
 

4279
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,030
uh and then part c is a sort of an
extension of part b

4280
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
extension of part b
 

4281
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,110
extension of part b
i got myself confused on part c so the

4282
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:41,120
i got myself confused on part c so the
 

4283
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,709
i got myself confused on part c so the
handwritten solutions have an incorrect

4284
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:42,719
handwritten solutions have an incorrect
 

4285
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,350
handwritten solutions have an incorrect
answer

4286
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:43,360
answer
 

4287
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,189
answer
and then an oops and then a correct

4288
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:45,199
and then an oops and then a correct
 

4289
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,110
and then an oops and then a correct
answer in it so you can see where my

4290
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,120
answer in it so you can see where my
 

4291
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,550
answer in it so you can see where my
logic went wrong

4292
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:48,560
logic went wrong
 

4293
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,110
logic went wrong
to be fair i i wrote i already knew the

4294
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:51,120
to be fair i i wrote i already knew the
 

4295
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,550
to be fair i i wrote i already knew the
full answer and wrote out both because i

4296
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:52,560
full answer and wrote out both because i
 

4297
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,590
full answer and wrote out both because i
thought that it was

4298
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:53,600
thought that it was
 

4299
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,950
thought that it was
useful um okay so

4300
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:56,960
useful um okay so
 

4301
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,870
useful um okay so
in case our our problem wasn't contrived

4302
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:58,880
in case our our problem wasn't contrived
 

4303
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,390
in case our our problem wasn't contrived
enough we're going to add a little bit

4304
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
enough we're going to add a little bit
 

4305
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,669
enough we're going to add a little bit
of condition to it and then what we're

4306
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:01,679
of condition to it and then what we're
 

4307
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:02,709
of condition to it and then what we're
going to see in part c

4308
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:02,719
going to see in part c
 

4309
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,950
going to see in part c
is the that's somehow a stepping stone

4310
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:04,960
is the that's somehow a stepping stone
 

4311
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,990
is the that's somehow a stepping stone
towards solving the bigger

4312
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
towards solving the bigger
 

4313
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,430
towards solving the bigger
problem so in part c they say that a

4314
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,440
problem so in part c they say that a
 

4315
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,550
problem so in part c they say that a
house in

4316
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:10,560
house in
 

4317
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,990
house in
in pork land is special

4318
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,000
in pork land is special
 

4319
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,270
in pork land is special
if it has one of two properties either

4320
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,280
if it has one of two properties either
 

4321
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,470
if it has one of two properties either
it has no easterly neighborhood neighbor

4322
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
it has no easterly neighborhood neighbor
 

4323
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,790
it has no easterly neighborhood neighbor
meaning that's just like the rightmost

4324
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:22,800
meaning that's just like the rightmost
 

4325
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,070
meaning that's just like the rightmost
house

4326
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,080
house
 

4327
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,910
house
yeah or its adjacent neighbor to the

4328
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:27,920
yeah or its adjacent neighbor to the
 

4329
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:28,870
yeah or its adjacent neighbor to the
east

4330
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:28,880
east
 

4331
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,590
east
contains at least as many bricks as it

4332
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:31,600
contains at least as many bricks as it
 

4333
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,590
contains at least as many bricks as it
does

4334
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:33,600
does
 

4335
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,430
does
right so what does that mean in terms of

4336
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
right so what does that mean in terms of
 

4337
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,709
right so what does that mean in terms of
this

4338
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:36,719
this
 

4339
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,470
this
list of of numbers which one of these

4340
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:38,480
list of of numbers which one of these
 

4341
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,990
list of of numbers which one of these
guys is is special

4342
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:40,000
guys is is special
 

4343
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,030
guys is is special
so the easterly guy is special we just

4344
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,040
so the easterly guy is special we just
 

4345
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:43,910
so the easterly guy is special we just
know that by

4346
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920
know that by
 

4347
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,709
know that by
default and other than that this special

4348
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:46,719
default and other than that this special
 

4349
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,229
default and other than that this special
property is saying that

4350
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:48,239
property is saying that
 

4351
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,550
property is saying that
the guy immediately to the right has a

4352
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:50,560
the guy immediately to the right has a
 

4353
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,030
the guy immediately to the right has a
bigger number than the guy or at least

4354
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
bigger number than the guy or at least
 

4355
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,510
bigger number than the guy or at least
you know equal to or larger to the one

4356
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:55,520
you know equal to or larger to the one
 

4357
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,709
you know equal to or larger to the one
uh right before it

4358
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:56,719
uh right before it
 

4359
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:01,350
uh right before it
yeah so 57 is bigger than 34 so this

4360
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
yeah so 57 is bigger than 34 so this
 

4361
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,630
yeah so 57 is bigger than 34 so this
guy's special

4362
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:02,640
guy's special
 

4363
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,910
guy's special
by the way the problem doesn't ask you

4364
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
by the way the problem doesn't ask you
 

4365
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,510
by the way the problem doesn't ask you
to do this on the example but i totally

4366
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:05,520
to do this on the example but i totally
 

4367
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,950
to do this on the example but i totally
would if i were solving this

4368
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:06,960
would if i were solving this
 

4369
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,229
would if i were solving this
yep um 70 is bigger than 57 so it's

4370
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:10,239
yep um 70 is bigger than 57 so it's
 

4371
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,030
yep um 70 is bigger than 57 so it's
special

4372
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,040
special
 

4373
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,110
special
19 is smaller than 70 so it's not

4374
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120
19 is smaller than 70 so it's not
 

4375
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,630
19 is smaller than 70 so it's not
special i'm sorry

4376
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:14,640
special i'm sorry
 

4377
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,750
special i'm sorry
uh 48 is bigger than 19

4378
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:17,760
uh 48 is bigger than 19
 

4379
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,149
uh 48 is bigger than 19
and i guess two is special just because

4380
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:20,159
and i guess two is special just because
 

4381
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,390
and i guess two is special just because
things on the right are special

4382
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:22,400
things on the right are special
 

4383
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,110
things on the right are special
okay so do we all get the definition

4384
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:25,120
okay so do we all get the definition
 

4385
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:25,750
okay so do we all get the definition
fabulous

4386
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:25,760
fabulous
 

4387
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,950
fabulous
so in this problem now

4388
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:28,960
so in this problem now
 

4389
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,229
so in this problem now
what we're given is that i guess uh

4390
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:32,239
what we're given is that i guess uh
 

4391
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,590
what we're given is that i guess uh
what our our evil uh wolf takes a walk

4392
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:35,600
what our our evil uh wolf takes a walk
 

4393
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,709
what our our evil uh wolf takes a walk
down the block

4394
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:36,719
down the block
 

4395
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:37,990
down the block
and takes a look at you know counts the

4396
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:38,000
and takes a look at you know counts the
 

4397
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,830
and takes a look at you know counts the
number of bricks at each house and

4398
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
number of bricks at each house and
 

4399
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,630
number of bricks at each house and
he or she makes an observation which is

4400
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:42,640
he or she makes an observation which is
 

4401
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:42,950
he or she makes an observation which is
at

4402
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:42,960
at
 

4403
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,229
at
all but one house is special

4404
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239

 

4405
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,510

now let's think about what that means

4406
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:49,520
now let's think about what that means
 

4407
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,709
now let's think about what that means
let's think about the structure of our

4408
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:50,719
let's think about the structure of our
 

4409
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,270
let's think about the structure of our
array

4410
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:51,280
array
 

4411
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,390
array
so what happens as i walk along my right

4412
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:54,400
so what happens as i walk along my right
 

4413
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,750
so what happens as i walk along my right
if the house is special what do i know

4414
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:55,760
if the house is special what do i know
 

4415
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,590
if the house is special what do i know
about the next house get blown if you

4416
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:57,600
about the next house get blown if you
 

4417
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,790
about the next house get blown if you
blow a special house down

4418
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
blow a special house down
 

4419
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,990
blow a special house down
that's true but we're already solving

4420
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,000
that's true but we're already solving
 

4421
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,870
that's true but we're already solving
the problem they're listening

4422
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:00,880
the problem they're listening
 

4423
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,149
the problem they're listening
qualitatively for a second

4424
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:02,159
qualitatively for a second
 

4425
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,430
qualitatively for a second
like just in terms of the number of

4426
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:03,440
like just in terms of the number of
 

4427
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,950
like just in terms of the number of
bricks right i'm walking down the street

4428
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:04,960
bricks right i'm walking down the street
 

4429
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,550
bricks right i'm walking down the street
i'm looking and the number of bricks

4430
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:06,560
i'm looking and the number of bricks
 

4431
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,030
i'm looking and the number of bricks
increases until i get to the one house

4432
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,040
increases until i get to the one house
 

4433
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,270
increases until i get to the one house
that isn't special

4434
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:11,280
that isn't special
 

4435
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,229
that isn't special
and then it decreases potentially or

4436
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:14,239
and then it decreases potentially or
 

4437
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:15,510
and then it decreases potentially or
it's the last one and then it starts

4438
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:15,520
it's the last one and then it starts
 

4439
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,189
it's the last one and then it starts
increasing again

4440
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:17,199
increasing again
 

4441
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,510
increasing again
yeah so in other words my array kind of

4442
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:19,520
yeah so in other words my array kind of
 

4443
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,950
yeah so in other words my array kind of
looks uh

4444
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:20,960
looks uh
 

4445
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,390
looks uh
like the following which is that it's

4446
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:22,400
like the following which is that it's
 

4447
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,630
like the following which is that it's
basically has two different pieces that

4448
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:24,640
basically has two different pieces that
 

4449
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,510
basically has two different pieces that
are both

4450
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:25,520
are both
 

4451
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,310
are both
sorted yeah that's what this long

4452
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,320
sorted yeah that's what this long
 

4453
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,590
sorted yeah that's what this long
paragraph is saying is saying

4454
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:29,600
paragraph is saying is saying
 

4455
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,030
paragraph is saying is saying
suppose that the list of houses is

4456
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:31,040
suppose that the list of houses is
 

4457
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,950
suppose that the list of houses is
sorted except for one thing

4458
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:32,960
sorted except for one thing
 

4459
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,470
sorted except for one thing
yeah that's how you could have said it

4460
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:34,480
yeah that's how you could have said it
 

4461
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,709
yeah that's how you could have said it
okay so uh here's an example so maybe we

4462
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:36,719
okay so uh here's an example so maybe we
 

4463
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:37,270
okay so uh here's an example so maybe we
have

4464
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:37,280
have
 

4465
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,950
have
one two three four and then i don't know

4466
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:40,960
one two three four and then i don't know
 

4467
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,310
one two three four and then i don't know
two three four five

4468
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
two three four five
 

4469
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,070
two three four five
so all of these is special with the

4470
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,080
so all of these is special with the
 

4471
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,110
so all of these is special with the
exception of this guy sadly for him

4472
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,120
exception of this guy sadly for him
 

4473
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,350
exception of this guy sadly for him
and so uh there's kind of like a little

4474
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:51,360
and so uh there's kind of like a little
 

4475
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,950
and so uh there's kind of like a little
dividing line

4476
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:52,960
dividing line
 

4477
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,790
dividing line
that happens to the left of which it's

4478
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:54,800
that happens to the left of which it's
 

4479
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,630
that happens to the left of which it's
sorted into the right

4480
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:56,640
sorted into the right
 

4481
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,350
sorted into the right
yeah okay and then the question is can

4482
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,360
yeah okay and then the question is can
 

4483
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,310
yeah okay and then the question is can
we predict

4484
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,320
we predict
 

4485
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,430
we predict
the damage for each house uh based on

4486
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,440
the damage for each house uh based on
 

4487
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,790
the damage for each house uh based on
this information

4488
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:04,800
this information
 

4489
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,189
this information
um so i want as output to my code an

4490
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:07,199
um so i want as output to my code an
 

4491
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:07,990
um so i want as output to my code an
array that says like

4492
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,000
array that says like
 

4493
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,830
array that says like
this guy causes so much damage this guy

4494
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:09,840
this guy causes so much damage this guy
 

4495
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,310
this guy causes so much damage this guy
causes so much damage and so on

4496
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:12,320
causes so much damage and so on
 

4497
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,149
causes so much damage and so on
and i want to get it in order end time

4498
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159

 

4499
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,669

let's think for a second so yeah we're

4500
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:17,679
let's think for a second so yeah we're
 

4501
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,669
let's think for a second so yeah we're
going to do that so order in time means

4502
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
going to do that so order in time means
 

4503
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,110
going to do that so order in time means
that i can't do i can't afford to do

4504
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:21,120
that i can't do i can't afford to do
 

4505
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:21,990
that i can't do i can't afford to do
like sorting and

4506
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:22,000
like sorting and
 

4507
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,990
like sorting and
all that kind of fancy stuff right so

4508
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
all that kind of fancy stuff right so
 

4509
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,350
all that kind of fancy stuff right so
basically all i can do is kind of walk

4510
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:25,360
basically all i can do is kind of walk
 

4511
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,390
basically all i can do is kind of walk
up and down the array

4512
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
up and down the array
 

4513
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,390
up and down the array
so we should think a bit about like

4514
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
so we should think a bit about like
 

4515
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,229
so we should think a bit about like
what's special about

4516
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
what's special about
 

4517
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,110
what's special about
special oh you say uh what's special

4518
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
special oh you say uh what's special
 

4519
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,630
special oh you say uh what's special
about this configuration that we

4520
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:34,640
about this configuration that we
 

4521
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,229
about this configuration that we
wouldn't normally have

4522
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
wouldn't normally have
 

4523
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,790
wouldn't normally have
anything before the non-special node

4524
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:38,800
anything before the non-special node
 

4525
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,790
anything before the non-special node
should have the same

4526
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
should have the same
 

4527
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,350
should have the same
or not sorry anything not quite

4528
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
or not sorry anything not quite
 

4529
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,430
or not sorry anything not quite
everything after the non-special node

4530
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
everything after the non-special node
 

4531
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,630
everything after the non-special node
causes only one damage yeah so so let's

4532
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:48,640
causes only one damage yeah so so let's
 

4533
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,350
causes only one damage yeah so so let's
think about this

4534
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:49,360
think about this
 

4535
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,110
think about this
carefully i think that's right but i i'm

4536
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
carefully i think that's right but i i'm
 

4537
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,550
carefully i think that's right but i i'm
bad at parsing sentences

4538
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:52,560
bad at parsing sentences
 

4539
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,630
bad at parsing sentences
um remember that i always blow to the

4540
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:54,640
um remember that i always blow to the
 

4541
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,390
um remember that i always blow to the
right and i only blow short stuff

4542
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,400
right and i only blow short stuff
 

4543
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,830
right and i only blow short stuff
so if i blow on uh

4544
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:01,840
so if i blow on uh
 

4545
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,350
so if i blow on uh
like this two here will anything before

4546
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:05,360
like this two here will anything before
 

4547
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,830
like this two here will anything before
that vertical line ever get blown over

4548
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:07,840
that vertical line ever get blown over
 

4549
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,229
that vertical line ever get blown over
no because by property of being special

4550
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
no because by property of being special
 

4551
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,590
no because by property of being special
we know that the list is increasing but

4552
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:11,600
we know that the list is increasing but
 

4553
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,110
we know that the list is increasing but
it has to decrease to blow something

4554
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:13,120
it has to decrease to blow something
 

4555
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:13,990
it has to decrease to blow something
over

4556
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:14,000
over
 

4557
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,110
over
that make sense so for each one of these

4558
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,120
that make sense so for each one of these
 

4559
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,350
that make sense so for each one of these
guys the only stuff you can blow is in

4560
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,360
guys the only stuff you can blow is in
 

4561
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,629
guys the only stuff you can blow is in
the second array does that make sense so

4562
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:22,639
the second array does that make sense so
 

4563
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,149
the second array does that make sense so
we made an observation notice that it is

4564
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:24,159
we made an observation notice that it is
 

4565
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,669
we made an observation notice that it is
special to the structure that we gave to

4566
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
special to the structure that we gave to
 

4567
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:26,629
special to the structure that we gave to
our problem

4568
01:20:26,629 --> 01:20:26,639
our problem
 

4569
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,750
our problem
yeah and moreover so

4570
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:29,760
yeah and moreover so
 

4571
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,030
yeah and moreover so
in both parts of this problem we're

4572
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
in both parts of this problem we're
 

4573
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,310
in both parts of this problem we're
going to kind of look at two parts of an

4574
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:32,320
going to kind of look at two parts of an
 

4575
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,910
going to kind of look at two parts of an
array and then merge them together in a

4576
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:33,920
array and then merge them together in a
 

4577
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,709
array and then merge them together in a
smart way

4578
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:34,719
smart way
 

4579
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,510
smart way
let's look on the right hand side does

4580
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:37,520
let's look on the right hand side does
 

4581
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,189
let's look on the right hand side does
any of these things like if i blow on

4582
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:39,199
any of these things like if i blow on
 

4583
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,550
any of these things like if i blow on
any of these houses what's the damage

4584
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
any of these houses what's the damage
 

4585
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,310
any of these houses what's the damage
that i do

4586
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:42,320
that i do
 

4587
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,550
that i do
what you see that because this is an

4588
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:44,560
what you see that because this is an
 

4589
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,149
what you see that because this is an
increasing list i only blow to the right

4590
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:46,159
increasing list i only blow to the right
 

4591
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:47,830
increasing list i only blow to the right
and it has to get shorter

4592
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:47,840
and it has to get shorter
 

4593
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,310
and it has to get shorter
yeah so for what partial credit on my

4594
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
yeah so for what partial credit on my
 

4595
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,510
yeah so for what partial credit on my
homework problem probably very little

4596
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:51,520
homework problem probably very little
 

4597
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,629
homework problem probably very little
partial credit

4598
01:20:52,629 --> 01:20:52,639
partial credit
 

4599
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,229
partial credit
but you know spiritually it's half of

4600
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,239
but you know spiritually it's half of
 

4601
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,310
but you know spiritually it's half of
your credit um

4602
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:56,320
your credit um
 

4603
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,750
your credit um
we know the second half of my array is

4604
01:20:59,750 --> 01:20:59,760
we know the second half of my array is
 

4605
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,350
we know the second half of my array is
just a bunch of ones

4606
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:01,360
just a bunch of ones
 

4607
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,189
just a bunch of ones
incidentally one detail which i bet

4608
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:03,199
incidentally one detail which i bet
 

4609
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,189
incidentally one detail which i bet
would get a minus one on your homework

4610
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:05,199
would get a minus one on your homework
 

4611
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:07,030
would get a minus one on your homework
we didn't tell you that all we told you

4612
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,040
we didn't tell you that all we told you
 

4613
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,550
we didn't tell you that all we told you
is that there existed one house that

4614
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:08,560
is that there existed one house that
 

4615
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,830
is that there existed one house that
wasn't special but we didn't tell you

4616
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:09,840
wasn't special but we didn't tell you
 

4617
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,030
wasn't special but we didn't tell you
which one

4618
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
which one
 

4619
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,790
which one
but notice that i can find it in order

4620
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:12,800
but notice that i can find it in order
 

4621
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,310
but notice that i can find it in order
end time right i can just walk along my

4622
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:14,320
end time right i can just walk along my
 

4623
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,510
end time right i can just walk along my
array and find the first place where it

4624
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:15,520
array and find the first place where it
 

4625
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,470
array and find the first place where it
decreases

4626
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:16,480
decreases
 

4627
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,629
decreases
and that's the special house yeah so i

4628
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:18,639
and that's the special house yeah so i
 

4629
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:19,750
and that's the special house yeah so i
can kind of assume that i know where

4630
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:19,760
can kind of assume that i know where
 

4631
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,870
can kind of assume that i know where
this line is that's that's

4632
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
this line is that's that's
 

4633
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,550
this line is that's that's
that's kosher so then the only question

4634
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:24,560
that's kosher so then the only question
 

4635
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,149
that's kosher so then the only question
is

4636
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
is
 

4637
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,270
is
how do i fill in my array here

4638
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:29,280
how do i fill in my array here
 

4639
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,189
how do i fill in my array here
right like how do i count and so so

4640
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
right like how do i count and so so
 

4641
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,390
right like how do i count and so so
let's think about this mathematically

4642
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
let's think about this mathematically
 

4643
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:32,950
let's think about this mathematically
because how

4644
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:32,960
because how
 

4645
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,550
because how
like porks and blowing and stuff is kind

4646
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:34,560
like porks and blowing and stuff is kind
 

4647
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,229
like porks and blowing and stuff is kind
of confusing so let's think about it in

4648
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
of confusing so let's think about it in
 

4649
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,350
of confusing so let's think about it in
terms of this array

4650
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:37,360
terms of this array
 

4651
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,110
terms of this array
essentially what am i trying to do so

4652
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:39,120
essentially what am i trying to do so
 

4653
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,790
essentially what am i trying to do so
for this two

4654
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:40,800
for this two
 

4655
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,229
for this two
i'm trying to look in the second half of

4656
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,239
i'm trying to look in the second half of
 

4657
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,390
i'm trying to look in the second half of
my array and find all the numbers here

4658
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:44,400
my array and find all the numbers here
 

4659
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,629
my array and find all the numbers here
that are less than 2.

4660
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:46,639
that are less than 2.
 

4661
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,310
that are less than 2.
right that's essentially what this

4662
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:48,320
right that's essentially what this
 

4663
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,870
right that's essentially what this
problem is asking you to do you see that

4664
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:50,880
problem is asking you to do you see that
 

4665
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,990
problem is asking you to do you see that
okay i'm going to make one so

4666
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
okay i'm going to make one so
 

4667
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,510
okay i'm going to make one so
here's a simple kind of n squared

4668
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
here's a simple kind of n squared
 

4669
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,750
here's a simple kind of n squared
algorithm right which is i could iterate

4670
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:57,760
algorithm right which is i could iterate
 

4671
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,950
algorithm right which is i could iterate
over every

4672
01:21:58,950 --> 01:21:58,960
over every
 

4673
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,430
over every
item here and just loop over here and

4674
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:01,440
item here and just loop over here and
 

4675
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,629
item here and just loop over here and
count the number of things that are less

4676
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
count the number of things that are less
 

4677
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,070
count the number of things that are less
than that

4678
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:04,080
than that
 

4679
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,510
than that
right that's a double for loop each of

4680
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
right that's a double for loop each of
 

4681
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,110
right that's a double for loop each of
which could be up to n so that's n

4682
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:07,120
which could be up to n so that's n
 

4683
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,070
which could be up to n so that's n
squared

4684
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
squared
 

4685
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,110
squared
those against the rules can't do it so

4686
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:11,120
those against the rules can't do it so
 

4687
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,189
those against the rules can't do it so
we need one more additional observation

4688
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:13,199
we need one more additional observation
 

4689
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,390
we need one more additional observation
okay let's think about this for a second

4690
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,400
okay let's think about this for a second
 

4691
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,350
okay let's think about this for a second
let's say i'm the wolf the pork blowing

4692
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,360
let's say i'm the wolf the pork blowing
 

4693
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,390
let's say i'm the wolf the pork blowing
wolf and i walk

4694
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:20,400
wolf and i walk
 

4695
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,790
wolf and i walk
from one house to the next and i keep

4696
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,800
from one house to the next and i keep
 

4697
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,189
from one house to the next and i keep
track of what houses get blown over here

4698
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:27,199

 

4699
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,870

now what happens as i walk from one

4700
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
now what happens as i walk from one
 

4701
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,629
now what happens as i walk from one
house to the left on the uh

4702
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:30,639
house to the left on the uh
 

4703
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,149
house to the left on the uh
to one house to the next on the

4704
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
to one house to the next on the
 

4705
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,750
to one house to the next on the
left-hand side

4706
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:33,760
left-hand side
 

4707
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,110
left-hand side
they're only getting taller right that's

4708
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:35,120
they're only getting taller right that's
 

4709
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,990
they're only getting taller right that's
what it means to be special

4710
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:38,000
what it means to be special
 

4711
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,270
what it means to be special
so the houses that get blown over here

4712
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,280
so the houses that get blown over here
 

4713
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,350
so the houses that get blown over here
the set of those only grows larger does

4714
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:43,360
the set of those only grows larger does
 

4715
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,709
the set of those only grows larger does
that make sense

4716
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
that make sense
 

4717
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,390
that make sense
right because as these guys get taller

4718
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,400
right because as these guys get taller
 

4719
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,830
right because as these guys get taller
more stuff falls over on the right hand

4720
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:47,840
more stuff falls over on the right hand
 

4721
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,310
more stuff falls over on the right hand
side

4722
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:48,320
side
 

4723
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,830
side
it's like a total goofball talking about

4724
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:49,840
it's like a total goofball talking about
 

4725
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,669
it's like a total goofball talking about
this problem

4726
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
this problem
 

4727
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,750
this problem
moreover these guys are in sorted order

4728
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:55,760
moreover these guys are in sorted order
 

4729
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,750
moreover these guys are in sorted order
yeah so

4730
01:22:59,750 --> 01:22:59,760

 

4731
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,430

what's going to end up happening is that

4732
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:01,440
what's going to end up happening is that
 

4733
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,189
what's going to end up happening is that
always there's just some interval of

4734
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
always there's just some interval of
 

4735
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:04,070
always there's just some interval of
houses

4736
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:04,080
houses
 

4737
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,430
houses
that gets knocked over so for example

4738
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:05,440
that gets knocked over so for example
 

4739
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,669
that gets knocked over so for example
the four goes over the two and the three

4740
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:07,679
the four goes over the two and the three
 

4741
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,830
the four goes over the two and the three
i guess notice that that always starts

4742
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:09,840
i guess notice that that always starts
 

4743
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,870
i guess notice that that always starts
on the left-hand side

4744
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:10,880
on the left-hand side
 

4745
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,709
on the left-hand side
and that's because these guys are sorted

4746
01:23:12,709 --> 01:23:12,719
and that's because these guys are sorted
 

4747
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:14,390
and that's because these guys are sorted
right the three just blows over the two

4748
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
right the three just blows over the two
 

4749
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,990
right the three just blows over the two
which is kind of a subset of the four

4750
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:16,000
which is kind of a subset of the four
 

4751
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,350
which is kind of a subset of the four
this isn't a great example because those

4752
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,360
this isn't a great example because those
 

4753
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,189
this isn't a great example because those
first two guys don't blow over anything

4754
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
first two guys don't blow over anything
 

4755
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,390
first two guys don't blow over anything
that makes sense any ideas how could i

4756
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:22,400
that makes sense any ideas how could i
 

4757
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,070
that makes sense any ideas how could i
use that observation to make an order

4758
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,080
use that observation to make an order
 

4759
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,709
use that observation to make an order

01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:42,480
yes binary search
 

4771
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,790
yes binary search
tell me more what would i search for so

4772
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:44,800
tell me more what would i search for so
 

4773
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,990
tell me more what would i search for so
let's say you have four

4774
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
let's say you have four
 

4775
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,830
let's say you have four
and you will buy your shirt for the ride

4776
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:51,840

 

4777
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,350

it's an interesting intuition and it's

4778
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:53,360
it's an interesting intuition and it's
 

4779
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,870
it's an interesting intuition and it's
like 82 right

4780
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:54,880
like 82 right
 

4781
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,110
like 82 right
so uh the the to repeat our colleague

4782
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,120
so uh the the to repeat our colleague
 

4783
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,390
so uh the the to repeat our colleague
suggestion which is a good one and we'll

4784
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:58,400
suggestion which is a good one and we'll
 

4785
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,750
suggestion which is a good one and we'll
make your code a lot faster

4786
01:23:59,750 --> 01:23:59,760
make your code a lot faster

you're in the right church wrong pew

4824
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:29,280
you're in the right church wrong pew
 

4825
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,149
you're in the right church wrong pew
here

4826
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:32,159

 

4827
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:33,350

but there's an observation we haven't

4828
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:33,360
but there's an observation we haven't
 

4829
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,590
but there's an observation we haven't
used yet which is as i move to the right

4830
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:35,600
used yet which is as i move to the right
 

4831
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,709
used yet which is as i move to the right
these numbers increase yeah

4832
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
these numbers increase yeah
 

4833
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,350
these numbers increase yeah
so what's going to happen to the index

4834
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
so what's going to happen to the index
 

4835
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,070
so what's going to happen to the index
of the stuff that gets blown over

4836
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:44,080
of the stuff that gets blown over
 

4837
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,910
of the stuff that gets blown over
it's always going to move this way is it

4838
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:45,920
it's always going to move this way is it
 

4839
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,470
it's always going to move this way is it
ever going to move to the left

4840
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
ever going to move to the left
 

4841
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,629
ever going to move to the left
no so there's a term that we used in the

4842
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:50,639
no so there's a term that we used in the
 

4843
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,229
no so there's a term that we used in the
two lectures ago

4844
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:52,239
two lectures ago
 

4845
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,590
two lectures ago
which is a term i never heard before but

4846
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:53,600
which is a term i never heard before but
 

4847
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,870
which is a term i never heard before but
i kind of like it it's called a

4848
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:54,880
i kind of like it it's called a
 

4849
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,510
i kind of like it it's called a
two-finger algorithm

4850
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:57,520
two-finger algorithm
 

4851
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,830
two-finger algorithm
yeah what does a two-finger algorithm do

4852
01:24:59,830 --> 01:24:59,840
yeah what does a two-finger algorithm do
 

4853
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,629
yeah what does a two-finger algorithm do
looks like this

4854
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
looks like this
 

4855
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,669
looks like this
two fingers yeah so

4856
01:25:03,669 --> 01:25:03,679
two fingers yeah so
 

4857
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,430
two fingers yeah so
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna keep my

4858
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:05,440
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna keep my
 

4859
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,189
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna keep my
finger on the right

4860
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:07,199
finger on the right
 

4861
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,870
finger on the right
pointing at the very first thing that

4862
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:08,880
pointing at the very first thing that
 

4863
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,030
pointing at the very first thing that
doesn't get blown over

4864
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:11,040
doesn't get blown over
 

4865
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,590
doesn't get blown over
okay so here right the one doesn't blow

4866
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:13,600
okay so here right the one doesn't blow
 

4867
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,189
okay so here right the one doesn't blow
over anything so it stays here

4868
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:15,199
over anything so it stays here
 

4869
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,709
over anything so it stays here
i'm going to iterate to the next guy

4870
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
i'm going to iterate to the next guy
 

4871
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,950
i'm going to iterate to the next guy
does the 2 blow over anything

4872
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:18,960
does the 2 blow over anything
 

4873
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,510
does the 2 blow over anything
no by the way the problem is written now

4874
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:21,520
no by the way the problem is written now
 

4875
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,350
no by the way the problem is written now
i'm going to move this guy here

4876
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:23,360
i'm going to move this guy here
 

4877
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,189
i'm going to move this guy here
well now the 3 blows over the the two

4878
01:25:25,189 --> 01:25:25,199
well now the 3 blows over the the two
 

4879
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,470
well now the 3 blows over the the two
here so i'm going to move

4880
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:26,480
here so i'm going to move
 

4881
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,270
here so i'm going to move
my right finger one thing to the right

4882
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,280
my right finger one thing to the right
 

4883
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,270
my right finger one thing to the right
and move the guy to the four

4884
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,280
and move the guy to the four
 

4885
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,189
and move the guy to the four
the four also the lower or anything and

4886
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:33,199
the four also the lower or anything and
 

4887
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,470
the four also the lower or anything and
then i guess i'm done

4888
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
then i guess i'm done
 

4889
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,310
then i guess i'm done
but the basic point here is that i'm

4890
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:36,320
but the basic point here is that i'm
 

4891
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,750
but the basic point here is that i'm
always going to be incrementing two

4892
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
always going to be incrementing two
 

4893
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,110
always going to be incrementing two
different pointers

4894
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:39,120
different pointers
 

4895
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,189
different pointers
and moving to the right and so what am i

4896
01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:41,199
and moving to the right and so what am i
 

4897
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:44,629
and moving to the right and so what am i
going to do i'm going to if i call this

4898
01:25:44,629 --> 01:25:44,639
going to do i'm going to if i call this
 

4899
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,990
going to do i'm going to if i call this
finger i

4900
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:48,000
finger i
 

4901
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,430
finger i
and this uh finger

4902
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:51,440
and this uh finger
 

4903
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,750
and this uh finger
j will i or j ever decrease

4904
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,760
j will i or j ever decrease
 

4905
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,149
j will i or j ever decrease
no so if my algorithm is looping over

4906
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
no so if my algorithm is looping over
 

4907
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,510
no so if my algorithm is looping over
all of these guys and they only ever

4908
01:25:59,510 --> 01:25:59,520
all of these guys and they only ever
 

4909
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,270
all of these guys and they only ever
touch each of these indices once i'm

4910
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:01,280
touch each of these indices once i'm
 

4911
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,629
touch each of these indices once i'm
going to get an order n

4912
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:02,639
going to get an order n
 

4913
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,430
going to get an order n
technique yeah and that's going to be

4914
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:05,440
technique yeah and that's going to be
 

4915
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,189
technique yeah and that's going to be
the basic trick to solving this problem

4916
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
the basic trick to solving this problem
 

4917
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:08,229
the basic trick to solving this problem
now i've managed to

4918
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:08,239
now i've managed to
 

4919
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:11,430
now i've managed to
talk myself out of time but basically

4920
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:11,440
talk myself out of time but basically
 

4921
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,950
talk myself out of time but basically
that's it so what i'm going to do

4922
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:12,960
that's it so what i'm going to do
 

4923
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,830
that's it so what i'm going to do
if we have 10 extra seconds is i'm going

4924
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
if we have 10 extra seconds is i'm going
 

4925
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,990
if we have 10 extra seconds is i'm going
to initialize

4926
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:22,000
to initialize
 

4927
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,550
to initialize
essentially for each eye

4928
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:28,560

 

4929
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,910

i'm going to increment

4930
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:33,920

 

4931
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:38,149

j until

4932
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:38,159

 

4933
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:41,669

the number of bricks at j

4934
01:26:41,669 --> 01:26:41,679
the number of bricks at j
 

4935
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,910
the number of bricks at j
is uh greater than the number of bricks

4936
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:43,920
is uh greater than the number of bricks
 

4937
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,030
is uh greater than the number of bricks
at i

4938
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:45,040
at i
 

4939
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,149
at i
because that should be greater than or

4940
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:46,159
because that should be greater than or
 

4941
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,790
because that should be greater than or
equal to right

4942
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:48,800
equal to right
 

4943
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,790
equal to right
and the reason to do that is that now

4944
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:50,800
and the reason to do that is that now
 

4945
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,070
and the reason to do that is that now
the number of houses that get blown over

4946
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,080
the number of houses that get blown over
 

4947
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,270
the number of houses that get blown over
is just this index j

4948
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:53,280
is just this index j
 

4949
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,229
is just this index j
minus the index of the first guy right

4950
01:26:56,229 --> 01:26:56,239
minus the index of the first guy right
 

4951
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:57,430
minus the index of the first guy right
and then i'll increment i

4952
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:57,440
and then i'll increment i
 

4953
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,110
and then i'll increment i
and and continue that make any sense

4954
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:01,120
and and continue that make any sense
 

4955
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,070
and and continue that make any sense
fabulous so i managed by some miracle to

4956
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:04,080
fabulous so i managed by some miracle to
 

4957
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:04,709
fabulous so i managed by some miracle to
make it to

4958
01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:04,719
make it to
 

4959
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,390
make it to
almost the end of this problem set minus

4960
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:06,400
almost the end of this problem set minus
 

4961
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,149
almost the end of this problem set minus
one part of one problem of course that's

4962
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159
one part of one problem of course that's
 

4963
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,270
one part of one problem of course that's
the hardest part of the whole problem

4964
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,280
the hardest part of the whole problem
 

4965
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:09,990
the hardest part of the whole problem
set

4966
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,000
set
 

4967
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,070
set
uh but there's an answer written out

4968
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,080
uh but there's an answer written out
 

4969
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,110
uh but there's an answer written out
where essentially now

4970
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:13,120
where essentially now
 

4971
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,110
where essentially now
the question is can you do exactly the

4972
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:15,120
the question is can you do exactly the
 

4973
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,870
the question is can you do exactly the
same algorithm but i don't give you this

4974
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:16,880
same algorithm but i don't give you this
 

4975
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,470
same algorithm but i don't give you this
special

4976
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:18,480
special
 

4977
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,310
special
assumption right that it increases and

4978
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:20,320
assumption right that it increases and
 

4979
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,070
assumption right that it increases and
then decreases

4980
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,080
then decreases
 

4981
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,030
then decreases
and it's going to be basically an

4982
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:23,040
and it's going to be basically an
 

4983
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,110
and it's going to be basically an
extension of this idea as we're going to

4984
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,120
extension of this idea as we're going to
 

4985
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,590
extension of this idea as we're going to
use this plus a little bit of merge sort

4986
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:27,600
use this plus a little bit of merge sort
 

4987
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,870
use this plus a little bit of merge sort
okay so with that we'll see you guys

4988
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:28,880
okay so with that we'll see you guys
 

4989
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,669
okay so with that we'll see you guys
next week

4990
01:27:29,669 --> 01:27:29,679
next week
 

4991
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:31,910
next week
it's always a pleasure and yeah have a

4992
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:31,920
it's always a pleasure and yeah have a
 

4993
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:41,440
it's always a pleasure and yeah have a
lovely weekend
