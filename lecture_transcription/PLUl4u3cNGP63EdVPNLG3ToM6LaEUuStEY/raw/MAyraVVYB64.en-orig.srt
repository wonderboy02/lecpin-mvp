uh binary trees specifically
 

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,630
uh binary trees specifically
being applied to set data structures and

32
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
being applied to set data structures and
 

33
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,229

sequence data structures
 

35
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,709
sequence data structures
as uh professor domain talked to you

36
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
as uh professor domain talked to you
 

37
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,310
as uh professor domain talked to you
earlier this week um but

38
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
earlier this week um but
 

39
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,990
earlier this week um but
for now uh actually as of yesterday

for now uh actually as of yesterday
 

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,910
for now uh actually as of yesterday
you've seen all of the data structures

42
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
you've seen all of the data structures
 

43
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,270
you've seen all of the data structures
that we're going to cover

44
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
that we're going to cover
 

45
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,910
that we're going to cover
to imp that that will implement the set

46
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:11,920
to imp that that will implement the set
 

47
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,070
to imp that that will implement the set
interface and the sequence interface

48
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
interface and the sequence interface
 

49
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,270
interface and the sequence interface
right those uh those nice tables that

50
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
right those uh those nice tables that
 

51
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,510
right those uh those nice tables that
uh professor domain has been showing you

52
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
uh professor domain has been showing you
 

53
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,310
uh professor domain has been showing you
right

54
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
right
 

55
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,749
right
uh those are now complete right we have

56
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
uh those are now complete right we have
 

57
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,910
uh those are now complete right we have
uh some data structures that are really

58
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
uh some data structures that are really
 

59
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,190
uh some data structures that are really
good constant time

60
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
good constant time
 

61
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,109
good constant time
operations for some operations so we

62
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
operations for some operations so we
 

63
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,030
operations for some operations so we
might choose them for some

64
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
might choose them for some
 

65
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,190
might choose them for some
uh applications and this week

66
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
uh applications and this week
 

67
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,310
uh applications and this week
we've been describing to you trees which

68
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
we've been describing to you trees which
 

69
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,870
we've been describing to you trees which
achieve like really pretty good for any

70
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
achieve like really pretty good for any
 

71
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,190

logarithmic time not quite constant

76
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
logarithmic time not quite constant
 

77
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,830
logarithmic time not quite constant
but for our purposes log n is

78
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
but for our purposes log n is
 

79
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,149
but for our purposes log n is

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,389
i mean on your computer practically
right not asymptotically but practically

82
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
right not asymptotically but practically

87
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,950

something like 64 right

88
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
something like 64 right
 

89
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,990
something like 64 right
any input that you're operating on with

90
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
any input that you're operating on with
 

91
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,589
any input that you're operating on with
uh and machine words as your input right

92
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
uh and machine words as your input right
 

93
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,270
uh and machine words as your input right
uh you need to be able to address all

94
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
uh you need to be able to address all
 

95
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,869
uh you need to be able to address all
those machine words right

96
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
those machine words right
 

97
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,229
those machine words right
in in your input and on your computer

98
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
in in your input and on your computer
 

99
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,710
in in your input and on your computer
the size of your machine word addresses

100
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
the size of your machine word addresses
 

101
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,229
the size of your machine word addresses
is 64 bits

102
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
is 64 bits
 

103
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,110
is 64 bits
right and we assume that the word size

104
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
right and we assume that the word size
 

105
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,630
right and we assume that the word size
is at least log

106
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
is at least log
 

107
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,790
is at least log
in the num the size of your input so

108
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
in the num the size of your input so
 

109
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,390
in the num the size of your input so
that you can address the input

110
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
that you can address the input
 

111
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,670
that you can address the input
right right so for your purposes on your

112
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
right right so for your purposes on your
 

113
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,869
right right so for your purposes on your
computer

114
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879

log n is going to be no more than 64

116
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
log n is going to be no more than 64
 

117
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,830
log n is going to be no more than 64
which means you get a maybe a 50 times

118
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
which means you get a maybe a 50 times
 

119
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,430
which means you get a maybe a 50 times
overhead or you know for smaller

120
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
overhead or you know for smaller
 

121
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,509
overhead or you know for smaller
instances it could be more like 10 right

122
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
instances it could be more like 10 right
 

123
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,550
instances it could be more like 10 right
if you've got like

124
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
if you've got like
 

125
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,710
if you've got like
a thousand things that you're working on

126
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
a thousand things that you're working on
 

127
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,229
a thousand things that you're working on
right it's not that bad

128
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
right it's not that bad
 

129
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,910
right it's not that bad
right it's a constant it's not a

130
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
right it's a constant it's not a
 

131
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,710
right it's a constant it's not a
constant factor for theory purposes

132
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
constant factor for theory purposes
 

133
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,949
constant factor for theory purposes
but for your purposes log n is much

134
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
but for your purposes log n is much
 

135
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,030
but for your purposes log n is much
better than a than a polynomial factor

136
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
better than a than a polynomial factor
 

137
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,070
better than a than a polynomial factor
right another factor of n okay so

138
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
right another factor of n okay so
 

139
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,670
right another factor of n okay so
uh you've seen all the code

140
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
uh you've seen all the code
 

141
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,350
uh you've seen all the code
you've seen implementations of all of

142
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
you've seen implementations of all of
 

143
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,229
you've seen implementations of all of
these set and sequence interfaces right

144
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
these set and sequence interfaces right
 

145
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,630
these set and sequence interfaces right
so i went ahead and wrote a little i

146
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
so i went ahead and wrote a little i
 

147
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,390
so i went ahead and wrote a little i
compiled all of that code from your

148
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400

recitation notes of all of the different
 

151
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,430
recitation notes of all of the different
interface implementations and what i did

152
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
interface implementations and what i did
 

153
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,630
interface implementations and what i did
was i

154
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
was i

they ran

158
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
they ran
 

159
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,229
they ran
on a real machine right so i have a

160
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
on a real machine right so i have a
 

161
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,270

175
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,509
implementing
all these kinds of things right then set

00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
all these kinds of things right then set
 

177
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,910
all these kinds of things right then set
things a sorted array being a set

and a binary tree and a hash table right
 

181
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,149
and a binary tree and a hash table right
these are our implementations i'm not

182
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
these are our implementations i'm not
 

183
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,710
these are our implementations i'm not
using

184
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
using
 

185
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,789
using
python dictionaries for hash tables i'm

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,110
python dictionaries for hash tables i'm
using the implementations that are in

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
using the implementations that are in
 

189
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,149
using the implementations that are in
your

190
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
your
 

191
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,229
your
restation and i'm going to run this

192
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
restation and i'm going to run this
 

193
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,670
restation and i'm going to run this
little test efficiency

194
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
little test efficiency
 

195
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,750
little test efficiency
python code that basically is just gonna

196
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
python code that basically is just gonna
 

197
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,830
python code that basically is just gonna
for each one it's gonna do a bunch of

198
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
for each one it's gonna do a bunch of
 

199
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,270
for each one it's gonna do a bunch of
these different operations

200
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
these different operations
 

201
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,270
these different operations
and measure to see how much time it took

202
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
and measure to see how much time it took
 

203
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,270
and measure to see how much time it took
right i'm just logging how much time it

204
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
right i'm just logging how much time it
 

205
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,910
right i'm just logging how much time it
took it's not an asymptotic analysis but

206
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
took it's not an asymptotic analysis but
 

207
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,589
took it's not an asymptotic analysis but
you know hopefully we see some

208
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
you know hopefully we see some
 

209
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,110
you know hopefully we see some
separation yeah

210
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
separation yeah
 

211
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,190
separation yeah
so i'm going to press that it runs a

212
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
so i'm going to press that it runs a
 

213
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,789
so i'm going to press that it runs a
bunch of tests so let's take a look

214
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
bunch of tests so let's take a look
 

215
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,990
bunch of tests so let's take a look
uh okay so i got a bunch of sequence

216
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
uh okay so i got a bunch of sequence
 

217
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,030
uh okay so i got a bunch of sequence
operations right we got build set at get

218
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
operations right we got build set at get
 

219
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,070
operations right we got build set at get
at insert delete

220
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
at insert delete
 

221
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,510
at insert delete
at the various places right and i'm

222
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
at the various places right and i'm
 

223
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,909
at the various places right and i'm
giving these are the actual timings to

224
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
giving these are the actual timings to
 

225
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,430
giving these are the actual timings to
some scale

226
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
some scale
 

227
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,830
some scale
right to some resolution that i had for

228
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
right to some resolution that i had for
 

229
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,510
right to some resolution that i had for
these data structures

230
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
these data structures
 

231
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,030
these data structures
and you can see build actually build

232
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
and you can see build actually build
 

233
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,270
and you can see build actually build
on this machine just allocating some

234
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
on this machine just allocating some
 

235
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,629
on this machine just allocating some
array and clearing it is a really

236
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
array and clearing it is a really
 

237
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,629
array and clearing it is a really
efficient thing that's python's going to

238
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
efficient thing that's python's going to
 

239
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,590
efficient thing that's python's going to
do for me

240
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
do for me
 

241
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,270
do for me
and so that's actually it's miss

242
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
and so that's actually it's miss
 

243
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,749
and so that's actually it's miss
labeling that as log n right

244
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
labeling that as log n right
 

245
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,310
labeling that as log n right
uh but uh you know these other things

246
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
uh but uh you know these other things
 

247
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,909
uh but uh you know these other things
get out and set act

248
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
get out and set act
 

249
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,150
get out and set act
really really fast right that's constant

250
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
really really fast right that's constant
 

251
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,990
really really fast right that's constant
time and then these other things i

252
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
time and then these other things i
 

253
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,710
time and then these other things i
essentially have

254
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
essentially have
 

255
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,310
essentially have
can't do better than loop through the

256
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
can't do better than loop through the
 

257
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,710
can't do better than loop through the
thing and so it takes linear time

258
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
thing and so it takes linear time
 

259
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,070
thing and so it takes linear time
and again sequence uh stuff

260
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
and again sequence uh stuff
 

261
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,029
and again sequence uh stuff
setting at and getting at is slow but

262
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
setting at and getting at is slow but
 

263
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:13,749
setting at and getting at is slow but
deleting

264
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
deleting
 

265
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,189
deleting
and removing from the first thing i'm

266
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
and removing from the first thing i'm
 

267
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,670
and removing from the first thing i'm
just re-linking the pointer right

268
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
just re-linking the pointer right
 

269
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,029
just re-linking the pointer right
dynamic arrays again set at get ad is

270
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
dynamic arrays again set at get ad is
 

271
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,310
dynamic arrays again set at get ad is
fast because it's just

272
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
fast because it's just
 

273
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,710
fast because it's just
dynamic it's just regular arrays and

274
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
dynamic it's just regular arrays and
 

275
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,590
dynamic it's just regular arrays and
then

276
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
then
 

277
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,430
then
inserting and deleting last that's

278
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
inserting and deleting last that's
 

279
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,909
inserting and deleting last that's
getting the essentially constant time

280
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
getting the essentially constant time
 

281
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,670
getting the essentially constant time
now i'm actually when i'm running these

282
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
now i'm actually when i'm running these
 

283
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,270
now i'm actually when i'm running these
tests to deal with averages

284
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
tests to deal with averages
 

285
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,790
tests to deal with averages
i'm actually running these things a lot

286
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
i'm actually running these things a lot
 

287
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,790
i'm actually running these things a lot
of times and testing their performance

288
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
of times and testing their performance
 

289
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,150
of times and testing their performance
and so i'm not seeing the worst case

290
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
and so i'm not seeing the worst case
 

291
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,110
and so i'm not seeing the worst case
happen here

292
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
happen here
 

293
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,790
happen here
right i'm averaging over all of the

294
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
right i'm averaging over all of the
 

295
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,909
right i'm averaging over all of the
things which is exactly what

296
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
things which is exactly what
 

297
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,749
things which is exactly what
amortization

298
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
amortization
 

299
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,270
amortization
means and so that's why i'm getting good

300
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
means and so that's why i'm getting good
 

301
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,830
means and so that's why i'm getting good
performance here

302
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
performance here
 

303
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,110
performance here
uh a hash table again

304
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
uh a hash table again
 

305
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,950
uh a hash table again
really uh oh so this is what we talked

306
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
really uh oh so this is what we talked
 

307
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,350
really uh oh so this is what we talked
about

308
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
about
 

309
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,629
about
in problem session last week right

310
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
in problem session last week right
 

311
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,749
in problem session last week right
implementing a uh kind of a double-ended

312
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
implementing a uh kind of a double-ended
 

313
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,510
implementing a uh kind of a double-ended
queue with a hash table

314
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
queue with a hash table
 

315
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,510
queue with a hash table
uh this is that implementation i just

316
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
uh this is that implementation i just
 

317
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,590
uh this is that implementation i just
want to show it to you but it's actually

318
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
want to show it to you but it's actually
 

319
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,670
want to show it to you but it's actually
pretty good this is what javascript uses

320
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
pretty good this is what javascript uses
 

321
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,909
pretty good this is what javascript uses
for arrays

322
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
for arrays
 

323
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,590
for arrays
and then a binary sequence represents a

324
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
and then a binary sequence represents a
 

325
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,550
and then a binary sequence represents a
binary tree

326
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
binary tree
 

327
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,710
binary tree
right a balanced binary tree this is our

328
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
right a balanced binary tree this is our
 

329
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,390
right a balanced binary tree this is our
avl code that i had

330
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
avl code that i had
 

331
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,469
avl code that i had
and you know all the other things have

332
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
and you know all the other things have
 

333
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,629
and you know all the other things have
been really pretty bad at insert at and

334
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
been really pretty bad at insert at and
 

335
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,670
been really pretty bad at insert at and
delete at

336
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
delete at
 

337
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,590
delete at
but this one does comparable to all the

338
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
but this one does comparable to all the
 

339
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
but this one does comparable to all the
other things now you see these are a

340
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
other things now you see these are a
 

341
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,230
other things now you see these are a
little bit more

342
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
little bit more
 

343
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,029
little bit more
you know machine cycles than the other

344
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
you know machine cycles than the other
 

345
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:35,830
you know machine cycles than the other
things but

346
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
things but
 

347
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,350
things but
you know not so bad actually uh and then

348
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
you know not so bad actually uh and then
 

349
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,590
you know not so bad actually uh and then
on the set side of things

350
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
on the set side of things
 

351
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,550
on the set side of things
again we had a sorted array uh sorry

352
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
again we had a sorted array uh sorry
 

353
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,150
again we had a sorted array uh sorry
this is a set from

354
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
this is a set from
 

355
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,469
this is a set from
an array basically it's an unsorted

356
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
an array basically it's an unsorted
 

357
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,749
an array basically it's an unsorted
array i'm just looking for all the

358
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
array i'm just looking for all the
 

359
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,390
array i'm just looking for all the
things that's very bad times

360
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
things that's very bad times
 

361
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,469
things that's very bad times
sorted array does these fine operations

362
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
sorted array does these fine operations
 

363
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,390
sorted array does these fine operations
great but inserting deleting is

364
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
great but inserting deleting is
 

365
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,749
great but inserting deleting is
poor right that's why we need binary

366
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
poor right that's why we need binary
 

367
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,710
poor right that's why we need binary
trees

368
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
trees
 

369
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,270
trees
hash tables you know get good kind of

370
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
hash tables you know get good kind of
 

371
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,270
hash tables you know get good kind of
dictionary operations but really bad

372
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
dictionary operations but really bad
 

373
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,309
dictionary operations but really bad
order operations right

374
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
order operations right
 

375
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,189
order operations right
and then the binary search tree right a

376
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
and then the binary search tree right a
 

377
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,950
and then the binary search tree right a
set binary tree

378
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
set binary tree
 

379
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,350
set binary tree
uh again does quite good on all of these

380
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
uh again does quite good on all of these
 

381
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,309
uh again does quite good on all of these
things

382
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
things
 

383
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,230
things
in fact it's getting really quite good

384
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
in fact it's getting really quite good
 

385
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,469
in fact it's getting really quite good
it's getting better for some reason than

386
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
it's getting better for some reason than
 

387
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,629
it's getting better for some reason than
these the sorted array even did

388
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
these the sorted array even did
 

389
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,670
these the sorted array even did
so uh i don't know why

390
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
so uh i don't know why
 

391
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,830
so uh i don't know why
our implementations are not optimized at

our implementations are not optimized at
 

393
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,110
our implementations are not optimized at
all but it does pretty well

394
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
all but it does pretty well
 

395
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,029
all but it does pretty well
asymptotically yep um could you explain

396
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
asymptotically yep um could you explain
 

397
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,830
asymptotically yep um could you explain
again why the

398
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
again why the
 

399
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,390
again why the

this is just labeled based off the

402
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
this is just labeled based off the
 

403
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,670
this is just labeled based off the
timings right

404
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
timings right
 

405
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,830
timings right
it happens to be that probably there's a

406
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
it happens to be that probably there's a
 

407
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,830
it happens to be that probably there's a
c intrinsic underneath python

408
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
c intrinsic underneath python
 

409
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,589
c intrinsic underneath python
that allocates this thing and so it does

410
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
that allocates this thing and so it does
 

411
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,589
that allocates this thing and so it does
it really fast and so my

412
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
it really fast and so my
 

413
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,270
it really fast and so my

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
program that's looking at these numbers
 

415

program that's looking at these numbers
and trying to guess what the asymptotic

416
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
and trying to guess what the asymptotic
 

417
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,150
and trying to guess what the asymptotic
running time is

418
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
running time is

i just it's it's mis characterizing

424
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
i just it's it's mis characterizing
 

425

i just it's it's mis characterizing
actually building it at any time

426
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
actually building it at any time
 

427
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,710
actually building it at any time
yeah well i mean in in actuality if it

428
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
yeah well i mean in in actuality if it
 

429
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,350
yeah well i mean in in actuality if it
was

430
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
was
 

431
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,309
was
c code right if all of this stuff was in

432
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
c code right if all of this stuff was in
 

433
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,110
c code right if all of this stuff was in
c

434
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
c
 

435
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,589
c
probably we'd see that that bar be

436
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
probably we'd see that that bar be
 

437
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,029
probably we'd see that that bar be
longer because it's actually having to

438
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
longer because it's actually having to
 

439
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,270
longer because it's actually having to
go through and touch all that memory

440
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
go through and touch all that memory
 

441
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,270
go through and touch all that memory
it's still doing that here but all the

442
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
it's still doing that here but all the
 

443
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,830
it's still doing that here but all the
python stuff is super crafty right it's

444
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
python stuff is super crafty right it's
 

445
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,230
python stuff is super crafty right it's
like

446
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
like
 

447
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,390
like
100 times slower than anything that c

448
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
100 times slower than anything that c
 

449
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,749
100 times slower than anything that c
does and so

450
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
does and so
 

451
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,550
does and so
you're seeing that that disparity here

452
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
you're seeing that that disparity here
 

453
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,830
you're seeing that that disparity here
does that make sense

454
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
does that make sense
 

455
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,749
does that make sense
okay so i just wanted to show you that

456
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
okay so i just wanted to show you that
 

457
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,149
okay so i just wanted to show you that
uh we might release this

458
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
uh we might release this
 

459
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,389
uh we might release this
for you to play around with but i just

460
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
for you to play around with but i just
 

461
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,190
for you to play around with but i just
wanted to

462
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
wanted to
 

463
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,670
wanted to
give you a taste of that okay any

464
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
give you a taste of that okay any
 

465
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,829
give you a taste of that okay any
questions

466
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
questions
 

467
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,110
questions
you move on how do i turn this off

468
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
you move on how do i turn this off
 

469
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,949
you move on how do i turn this off
up and off

470
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
up and off
 

471
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,770

475
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,550

yes okay so what

476
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560

 

477
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,590

all right so moving on to problems

478
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
all right so moving on to problems
 

479
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,030
all right so moving on to problems
working some problems uh so you have

480
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
working some problems uh so you have
 

481
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,790
working some problems uh so you have
your set of problems here uh the first

482
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
your set of problems here uh the first
 

483
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,750
your set of problems here uh the first
one is we're going to look at a sequence

484
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
one is we're going to look at a sequence
 

485
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,310
one is we're going to look at a sequence
avl tree right this is a sequence abl

486
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
avl tree right this is a sequence abl
 

487
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,030
avl tree right this is a sequence abl
tree how do i know that

488
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040

 

489
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,310

you don't necessarily but these things

490
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
you don't necessarily but these things
 

491
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,430
you don't necessarily but these things
are certainly not

492
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
are certainly not
 

493
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,590
are certainly not
in sorted order of the things i'm

494
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
in sorted order of the things i'm
 

495
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,550
in sorted order of the things i'm
storied in them

496
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
storied in them
 

497
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,750
storied in them
right so it better not be a set avl tree

498
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
right so it better not be a set avl tree
 

499
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,150
right so it better not be a set avl tree
right is it an avl tree is it balanced

500
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
right is it an avl tree is it balanced
 

501
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,470
right is it an avl tree is it balanced
height balanced

502
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
height balanced
 

503
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,350
height balanced
yeah yeah basically actually if you take

504
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
yeah yeah basically actually if you take
 

505
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,590
yeah yeah basically actually if you take
compute the size of each subtree

506
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
compute the size of each subtree
 

507
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,550
compute the size of each subtree

all these you can confirm for yourself

510
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
all these you can confirm for yourself
 

511
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,670
all these you can confirm for yourself
are balanced right there they're

512
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
are balanced right there they're
 

513
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,910
are balanced right there they're
within plus or minus one of each other

515
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,910
within plus or minus one of each other
actually this is about as far away from

516
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
actually this is about as far away from
 

517
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,590
actually this is about as far away from
balance as you could get

518
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
balance as you could get
 

519
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,110

what is the sequence avl tree store that

542
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
what is the sequence avl tree store that
 

543
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,030
what is the sequence avl tree store that
i'm not showing in this picture

544
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
i'm not showing in this picture
 

545
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,310
i'm not showing in this picture
what counts and

546
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320

 

547
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,910

it's a sequence avl tree heights

548
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
it's a sequence avl tree heights
 

549
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,150
it's a sequence avl tree heights
right so it's a sequence avl trees

550
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
right so it's a sequence avl trees
 

551
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,430
right so it's a sequence avl trees
different than set available trees are

552
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
different than set available trees are
 

553
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,590
different than set available trees are
augmented by two things right because

554
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
augmented by two things right because
 

555
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,550
augmented by two things right because
i need to be maintaining balance during

556
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
i need to be maintaining balance during
 

557
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,790
i need to be maintaining balance during
rotations and so i need to store heights

558
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
rotations and so i need to store heights
 

559
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,230
rotations and so i need to store heights
i need to be able to tell what the

560
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
i need to be able to tell what the
 

561
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,590
i need to be able to tell what the
heights of these sub trees are in

562
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
heights of these sub trees are in
 

563
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,790
heights of these sub trees are in
constant time when i'm

564
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
constant time when i'm
 

565
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,190
constant time when i'm
walking up the tree fixing things and

566
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
walking up the tree fixing things and
 

567
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,990
walking up the tree fixing things and
the sequence

568
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
the sequence
 

569
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,790
the sequence
requires me to store their subtree the

570
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
requires me to store their subtree the
 

571
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,910
requires me to store their subtree the
numbers there

572
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
numbers there
 

573
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,350
numbers there
right so i don't know i'm not going to

574
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
right so i don't know i'm not going to
 

575
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,430
right so i don't know i'm not going to
draw it for all of these things but how

576
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
draw it for all of these things but how
 

577
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,110
draw it for all of these things but how
about for number 4

578
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
about for number 4
 

579
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,590
about for number 4
what's its height

580
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600

 

581
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,030

one two three that's the longest path

582
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
one two three that's the longest path
 

583
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,190
one two three that's the longest path
from the sub the root subtree of that so

584
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
from the sub the root subtree of that so
 

585
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,550
from the sub the root subtree of that so
this is you know

586
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
this is you know
 

587
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,150
this is you know
height equals uh three that came from

588
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
height equals uh three that came from
 

589
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,990
height equals uh three that came from
height equals two and height is one let

590
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
height equals two and height is one let
 

591
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,870
height equals two and height is one let
everyone see that

592
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
everyone see that
 

593
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,990
everyone see that
yeah and then the size here how big is

594
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
yeah and then the size here how big is
 

595
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,110
yeah and then the size here how big is
that that's

596
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
that that's
 

597
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,150
that that's
one two three four five six seven right

598
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
one two three four five six seven right
 

599
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,870
one two three four five six seven right
so this is

600
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
so this is
 

601
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,069
so this is
i'm gonna put size equals seven

602
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
i'm gonna put size equals seven
 

603
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,069
i'm gonna put size equals seven
here right and that's coming from this

604
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
here right and that's coming from this
 

605
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,269
here right and that's coming from this
guy one two three

606
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
guy one two three
 

607
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,389
guy one two three
four and this guy

608
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
four and this guy
 

609
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,590
four and this guy
is two

610
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600

 

611
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,630

right so how do i compute the subtree

612
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
right so how do i compute the subtree
 

613
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,590
right so how do i compute the subtree
size

614
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
size
 

615
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,670
size
it's my left subtree size plus my right

616
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
it's my left subtree size plus my right
 

617
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,269
it's my left subtree size plus my right
subtree size plus 1

618
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
subtree size plus 1
 

619
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,430
subtree size plus 1
right and my height is taking the max of

620
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
right and my height is taking the max of
 

621
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,110
right and my height is taking the max of
the 2 plus 1 right

622
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
the 2 plus 1 right
 

623
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,910
the 2 plus 1 right
all right so we did all that yesterday

624
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
all right so we did all that yesterday
 

625
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,790
all right so we did all that yesterday
so i'm

626
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
so i'm
 

627
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,509
so i'm
just labeling these things and what i'm

628
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
just labeling these things and what i'm
 

629
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,150
just labeling these things and what i'm
asking of you

630
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
asking of you
 

631
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,590
asking of you
is to perform a delete operation

632
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
is to perform a delete operation
 

633
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,949
is to perform a delete operation
is a sequence uh tree so i'm

634
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
is a sequence uh tree so i'm
 

635
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,190
is a sequence uh tree so i'm
i'm finding things by their index in the

636
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
i'm finding things by their index in the
 

637
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,030
i'm finding things by their index in the
tree right so i'm going to ask you to

638
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
tree right so i'm going to ask you to
 

639
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,710
tree right so i'm going to ask you to
delete the eighth thing

640
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
delete the eighth thing
 

641
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,110
delete the eighth thing
in my sequence okay so what is the

642
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
in my sequence okay so what is the
 

643
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,629
in my sequence okay so what is the
eighth thing in my sequence

644
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639

 

645
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,350

yeah all right just to clarify is not

646
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
yeah all right just to clarify is not
 

647
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,829
yeah all right just to clarify is not
delete

648
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
delete
 

649
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,030
delete
a number correct well delete at

650
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
a number correct well delete at
 

651
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,870
a number correct well delete at
eight do you see that it's a sequence

652
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
eight do you see that it's a sequence
 

653
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,230
eight do you see that it's a sequence
operation

654
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
operation
 

655
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,030
operation
yeah so this is very important that you

656
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
yeah so this is very important that you
 

657
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,069
yeah so this is very important that you
differentiate between

658
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
differentiate between
 

659
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,389
differentiate between
sequence and set semantics right if i'm

660
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
sequence and set semantics right if i'm
 

661
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,990
sequence and set semantics right if i'm
dealing with the sequence

662
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
dealing with the sequence
 

663
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,790
dealing with the sequence
i better not be looking up intrinsic

664
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
i better not be looking up intrinsic
 

665
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,949
i better not be looking up intrinsic
things on this data structure right

666
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
things on this data structure right
 

667
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,389
things on this data structure right
because it's not an intrinsic data

668
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
because it's not an intrinsic data
 

669
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,910
because it's not an intrinsic data
structure it doesn't support that so if

670
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
structure it doesn't support that so if
 

671
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,389
structure it doesn't support that so if
i

672
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
i
 

673
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,430
i
wanted to support find

674
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
wanted to support find
 

675
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,710
wanted to support find
the say the index of key 8

676
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
the say the index of key 8
 

677
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,910
the say the index of key 8
or something like that right then all i

678
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
or something like that right then all i
 

679
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,509
or something like that right then all i
could do is it's similar to like an

680
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
could do is it's similar to like an
 

681
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,190
could do is it's similar to like an
array i would just have to loop through

682
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
array i would just have to loop through
 

683
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,790
array i would just have to loop through
the whole sequence and tell me if the

684
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
the whole sequence and tell me if the
 

685
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,509
the whole sequence and tell me if the
thing's in there

686
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
thing's in there
 

687
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,430
thing's in there
right can't really do better than linear

688
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
right can't really do better than linear
 

689
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,509
right can't really do better than linear
time this data structure is not designed

690
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
time this data structure is not designed
 

691
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,870
time this data structure is not designed
for that what is it designed for it's

692
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
for that what is it designed for it's
 

693
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,190
for that what is it designed for it's
designed to find things by their index

694
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
designed to find things by their index
 

695
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,710
designed to find things by their index
in the sequence right so uh

696
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
in the sequence right so uh
 

697
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,910
in the sequence right so uh
how do i find the eighth index

698
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
how do i find the eighth index
 

699
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,069
how do i find the eighth index
well i mean i'm looking at the tree and

700
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
well i mean i'm looking at the tree and
 

701
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,949
well i mean i'm looking at the tree and
i can just

702
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
i can just
 

703
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,470
i can just
you know count along the in order

704
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
you know count along the in order
 

705
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,829
you know count along the in order
traversal what's the inorder traversal

706
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
traversal what's the inorder traversal
 

707
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,750
traversal what's the inorder traversal
right zero one two

708
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
right zero one two
 

709
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,190
right zero one two
three four five six seven eight okay

710
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
three four five six seven eight okay
 

711
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,710
three four five six seven eight okay
found eight but what does a sequence avl

712
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
found eight but what does a sequence avl
 

713
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,150
found eight but what does a sequence avl
tree do

714
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
tree do
 

715
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,990
tree do
right it i'm storing subtree sizes

716
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
right it i'm storing subtree sizes
 

717
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,590
right it i'm storing subtree sizes
and when i'm here i don't know what

718
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
and when i'm here i don't know what
 

719
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,910
and when i'm here i don't know what
index i'm at right

720
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
index i'm at right
 

721
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,670
index i'm at right
how can i find out what index i'm at

722
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
how can i find out what index i'm at
 

723
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,150
how can i find out what index i'm at
from the root i look at my left sub tree

724
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
from the root i look at my left sub tree
 

725
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,150
from the root i look at my left sub tree
see how many it is

726
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
see how many it is
 

727
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,350
see how many it is
right there are seven things here

728
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
right there are seven things here
 

729
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,350
right there are seven things here
uh one two three four five seven

730
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
uh one two three four five seven
 

731
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,990
uh one two three four five seven
eight right yeah because i'm looking for

732
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
eight right yeah because i'm looking for
 

733
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,269
eight right yeah because i'm looking for
the ninth item

734
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
the ninth item
 

735
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,829
the ninth item
by index eight right so this is saying

736
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
by index eight right so this is saying
 

737
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,350
by index eight right so this is saying
that i'm the eighth item

738
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
that i'm the eighth item
 

739
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,430
that i'm the eighth item
right and the guy at index seven

740
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
right and the guy at index seven
 

741
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,870
right and the guy at index seven
does that make sense because i'm looking

742
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
does that make sense because i'm looking
 

743
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,110
does that make sense because i'm looking
at the subtree size here

744
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
at the subtree size here
 

745
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,829
at the subtree size here
so what do i know i know that the index

746
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
so what do i know i know that the index
 

747
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,150
so what do i know i know that the index
that i'm looking for is to my right

748
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
that i'm looking for is to my right
 

749
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,430
that i'm looking for is to my right
right so i go down over here

750
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
right so i go down over here
 

751
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,389
right so i go down over here
and i happen to know what am i what

752
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
and i happen to know what am i what
 

753
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,350
and i happen to know what am i what
index of

754
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
index of
 

755
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,430
index of
of am i looking for in this subtree

756
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
of am i looking for in this subtree
 

757
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,910
of am i looking for in this subtree
zero right i want the first thing in

758
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
zero right i want the first thing in
 

759
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,350
zero right i want the first thing in
this sub tree

760
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
this sub tree
 

761
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,310
this sub tree
my search index has changed now right

762
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
my search index has changed now right
 

763
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,949
my search index has changed now right
because i

764
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
because i
 

765
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,350
because i
essentially dealt with all of those

766
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
essentially dealt with all of those
 

767
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,710
essentially dealt with all of those
eight items

768
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
eight items
 

769
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,430
eight items
right so here i'm looking for the zero

770
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
right so here i'm looking for the zero
 

771
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,790
right so here i'm looking for the zero
thing in my index

772
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
thing in my index
 

773
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,949
thing in my index
i look to my left if i didn't have a

774
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
i look to my left if i didn't have a
 

775
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,269
i look to my left if i didn't have a
left sub tree i would be the zero thing

776
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
left sub tree i would be the zero thing
 

777
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,350
left sub tree i would be the zero thing
right and i would return me but there is

778
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
right and i would return me but there is
 

779
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,350
right and i would return me but there is
stuff in here so i'm looking for the

780
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
stuff in here so i'm looking for the
 

781
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,629
stuff in here so i'm looking for the
zero thing in here right

782
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
zero thing in here right
 

783
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,430
zero thing in here right
which is just him and i return it okay

784
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
which is just him and i return it okay
 

785
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,550
which is just him and i return it okay
and actually what i'm doing is i'm

786
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
and actually what i'm doing is i'm
 

787
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,350
and actually what i'm doing is i'm
deleting it

788
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
deleting it
 

789
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,150
deleting it
right so i delete it

790
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
right so i delete it
 

791
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,470
right so i delete it
yuck what's the problem here

792
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480

 

793
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,310

i'm not high balance weird what's not

794
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
i'm not high balance weird what's not
 

795
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,150
i'm not high balance weird what's not
height balanced here

796
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
height balanced here
 

797
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,430
height balanced here
um the lug subtree is earth

798
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
um the lug subtree is earth
 

799
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,990
um the lug subtree is earth
so this guy's not height balance right

800
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
so this guy's not height balance right
 

801
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,949
so this guy's not height balance right
right

802
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
right
 

803
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,949
right
this guy's subtree is not height balance

804
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
this guy's subtree is not height balance
 

805
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,430
this guy's subtree is not height balance
right this guy's two this guy's one

806
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
right this guy's two this guy's one
 

807
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,590
right this guy's two this guy's one
okay so how do we fix it

808
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600

 

809
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,990

we do some rotations right this is

810
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
we do some rotations right this is
 

811
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,870
we do some rotations right this is
actually the

812
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
actually the
 

813
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,350
actually the
bad case that with the third bad case

814
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
bad case that with the third bad case
 

815
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,790
bad case that with the third bad case
that we talked about yesterday

816
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
that we talked about yesterday
 

817
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,670
that we talked about yesterday
right if i tried to just left rotate

818
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
right if i tried to just left rotate
 

819
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,230
right if i tried to just left rotate
this

820
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
this
 

821
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,430
this
guy what would it look like it would put

822
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
guy what would it look like it would put
 

823
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,710
guy what would it look like it would put
12 here it would put 10 here and 8 would

824
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
12 here it would put 10 here and 8 would
 

825
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,269
12 here it would put 10 here and 8 would
be attached to that

826
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
be attached to that
 

827
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,949
be attached to that
now it's height balance wrong in the

828
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
now it's height balance wrong in the
 

829
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,590
now it's height balance wrong in the
other direction right that's no good

830
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
other direction right that's no good
 

831
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,150
other direction right that's no good
right so the way to handle this case

832
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
right so the way to handle this case
 

833
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,430
right so the way to handle this case
where

834
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
where
 

835
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,550
where
i'm badly skewed to the right

836
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
i'm badly skewed to the right
 

837
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,269
i'm badly skewed to the right
but my right subtree is badly skew is

838
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
but my right subtree is badly skew is
 

839
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,030
but my right subtree is badly skew is
skewed to the left

840
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
skewed to the left
 

841
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,990
skewed to the left
i have to do a rotation here right

842
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
i have to do a rotation here right
 

843
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,629
i have to do a rotation here right
rotation

844
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
rotation
 

845
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,870
rotation
and then do a rotation so that's that's

846
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
and then do a rotation so that's that's
 

847
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,470
and then do a rotation so that's that's
the formula okay

848
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
the formula okay
 

849
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,949
the formula okay
so here we first do a right rotation at

850
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
so here we first do a right rotation at
 

851
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,990
so here we first do a right rotation at
10

852
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
10
 

853
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,030
10
okay which gives me something that looks

854
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
okay which gives me something that looks
 

855
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,230
okay which gives me something that looks
like

856
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240

 

857
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,269

8 10 okay

858
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
8 10 okay
 

859
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,150
8 10 okay
well obviously this is uh not better

860
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
well obviously this is uh not better
 

861
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,430
well obviously this is uh not better
than what was before but it's an

862
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
than what was before but it's an
 

863
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,110
than what was before but it's an
intermediate step so that we can fix it

864
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
intermediate step so that we can fix it
 

865
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,629
intermediate step so that we can fix it
right

866
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
right
 

867
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,310
right
we right rotate here and then we left

868
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
we right rotate here and then we left
 

869
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,829
we right rotate here and then we left
rotate here right

870
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
rotate here right
 

871
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,829
rotate here right
the default is that we would left rotate

872
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
the default is that we would left rotate
 

873
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,069
the default is that we would left rotate
here but because this had

874
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
here but because this had
 

875
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,629
here but because this had
the skew in the wrong direction i need

876
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
the skew in the wrong direction i need
 

877
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,110
the skew in the wrong direction i need
to

878
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
to
 

879
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,790
to
right rotate this one first and then we

880
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
right rotate this one first and then we
 

881
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,230
right rotate this one first and then we
can do it so now i

882
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
can do it so now i
 

883
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,990
can do it so now i
rotate all of these guys over right

884
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
rotate all of these guys over right
 

885
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,269
rotate all of these guys over right
and put 12 down here 8 here

886
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
and put 12 down here 8 here
 

887
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,870
and put 12 down here 8 here
10 here done

888
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
10 here done
 

889
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,550
10 here done
everyone see that that's what a rotation

890
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
everyone see that that's what a rotation
 

891
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,550
everyone see that that's what a rotation
looks like

892
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
looks like
 

893
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,710
looks like
okay it takes a little while to get your

894
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
okay it takes a little while to get your
 

895
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,829
okay it takes a little while to get your
mind wrapped around

896
00:16:59,829 --> 00:16:59,839
mind wrapped around
 

897
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,150
mind wrapped around
what the transformation is but hopefully

898
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
what the transformation is but hopefully
 

899
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,670
what the transformation is but hopefully
you guys all followed

900
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
you guys all followed
 

901
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,029
you guys all followed
that transformation there was a little

902
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
that transformation there was a little
 

903
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,870
that transformation there was a little
magic while i was trying to draw yeah

904
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
magic while i was trying to draw yeah
 

905
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,470
magic while i was trying to draw yeah
i still don't feel like this tree is

906
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
i still don't feel like this tree is
 

907
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,870
i still don't feel like this tree is
high balance it's not

908
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
high balance it's not
 

909
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,309
high balance it's not
good observation why is that this thing

910
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
good observation why is that this thing
 

911
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,590
good observation why is that this thing
still has height three

912
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
still has height three
 

913
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,150
still has height three
what is the height of this thing one

914
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
what is the height of this thing one
 

915
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,789
what is the height of this thing one
right

916
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
right
 

917
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,350
right
this is height one and actually when i

918
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360
this is height one and actually when i
 

919
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,270
this is height one and actually when i
was doing that rotation

920
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
was doing that rotation
 

921
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,549
was doing that rotation
i needed to update all these

922
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
i needed to update all these
 

923
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,870
i needed to update all these
augmentations right

924
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
augmentations right
 

925
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,549
augmentations right
how which augmentations did i really

926
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
how which augmentations did i really
 

927
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,549
how which augmentations did i really
need to which subtrees have changed

928
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
need to which subtrees have changed
 

929
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,230
need to which subtrees have changed
during those things

930
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240

 

931
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,990

i don't remember what the thing looked

932
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
i don't remember what the thing looked
 

933
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,070
i don't remember what the thing looked
like what did the thing look like

934
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
like what did the thing look like
 

935
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,230
like what did the thing look like
10 10 had eight in its subtree

936
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
10 10 had eight in its subtree
 

937
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,789
10 10 had eight in its subtree
so its subtree definitely changed right

938
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
so its subtree definitely changed right
 

939
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,110
so its subtree definitely changed right
eight sub tree changed

940
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
eight sub tree changed
 

941
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,630
eight sub tree changed
twelve didn't change eventually

942
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640

 

943
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,029

okay so there's the case analysis that's

944
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
okay so there's the case analysis that's
 

945
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,310
okay so there's the case analysis that's
in your lecture notes and was done in

946
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
in your lecture notes and was done in
 

947
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,510
in your lecture notes and was done in
recitation

948
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
recitation
 

949
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,710
recitation
right it tells you that these a b

950
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
right it tells you that these a b
 

951
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,070
right it tells you that these a b
c d kind of sub trees right

952
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
c d kind of sub trees right
 

953
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,350
c d kind of sub trees right
the ones that could change in these

954
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
the ones that could change in these
 

955
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,430
the ones that could change in these
things those sub trees don't change

956
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
things those sub trees don't change
 

957
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,909
things those sub trees don't change
the only sub trees that change during

958
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
the only sub trees that change during
 

959
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,669
the only sub trees that change during
one of these fixed operations when you

960
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
one of these fixed operations when you
 

961
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,590
one of these fixed operations when you
do one or two rotations

962
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
do one or two rotations
 

963
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,710
do one or two rotations
is either two nodes or three nodes that

964
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720
is either two nodes or three nodes that
 

965
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,590
is either two nodes or three nodes that
whose subtree has changed here uh it

966
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
whose subtree has changed here uh it
 

967
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,029
whose subtree has changed here uh it
could have been the case that three

968
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
could have been the case that three
 

969
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,630
could have been the case that three
sub trees have changed right but in the

970
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
sub trees have changed right but in the
 

971
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,590
sub trees have changed right but in the
easy case

972
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
easy case
 

973
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,310
easy case
only two nodes x and y i think in the

974
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
only two nodes x and y i think in the
 

975
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,950
only two nodes x and y i think in the
notes

976
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
notes
 

977
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,110
notes
could have changed and so when i do that

978
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
could have changed and so when i do that
 

979
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,270
could have changed and so when i do that
i have to recompute

980
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
i have to recompute
 

981
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,270
i have to recompute
their augmentations from their

982
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
their augmentations from their
 

983
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,110
their augmentations from their
augmentations of their children

984
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
augmentations of their children
 

985
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,669
augmentations of their children
but uh it's only a constant number of

986
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
but uh it's only a constant number of
 

987
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,870
but uh it's only a constant number of
those so i just

988
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
those so i just
 

989
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,270
those so i just
recompute them because i the sub trees

990
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
recompute them because i the sub trees
 

991
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,470
recompute them because i the sub trees
below me haven't changed

992
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
below me haven't changed
 

993
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,350
below me haven't changed
right okay so we have a height mismatch

994
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360
right okay so we have a height mismatch
 

995
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,510
right okay so we have a height mismatch
here

996
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:50,520
here
 

997
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,830
here
yeah should be where

998
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
yeah should be where
 

999
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,870
yeah should be where
eight is

1000
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880

 

1001
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,870

right so uh originally in the picture

1002
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
right so uh originally in the picture
 

1003
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,190
right so uh originally in the picture
12 has a bunch of things in its subtree

1004
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
12 has a bunch of things in its subtree
 

1005
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,990
12 has a bunch of things in its subtree
right

1006
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
right
 

1007
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,230
right
10 and 8 and we just deleted seven right

1008
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
10 and 8 and we just deleted seven right
 

1009
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,830
10 and 8 and we just deleted seven right
so its subtree definitely changed there

1010
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
so its subtree definitely changed there
 

1011
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,909
so its subtree definitely changed there
used to be three

1012
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
used to be three
 

1013
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,350
used to be three
oh no sorry it did right yeah so here

1014
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
oh no sorry it did right yeah so here
 

1015
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,789
oh no sorry it did right yeah so here
three node sub trees have changed but

1016
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
three node sub trees have changed but
 

1017
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,029
three node sub trees have changed but
uh that's the actually the most i'm

1018
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
uh that's the actually the most i'm
 

1019
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,990
uh that's the actually the most i'm
showing you the worst

1020
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
showing you the worst
 

1021
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,510
showing you the worst
case right only three nodes possible in

1022
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
case right only three nodes possible in
 

1023
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,470
case right only three nodes possible in
doing one of these

1024
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
doing one of these
 

1025
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,390
doing one of these
double rotation things could have

1026
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
double rotation things could have
 

1027
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,909
double rotation things could have
changed their sub trees and so we just

1028
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
changed their sub trees and so we just
 

1029
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,870
changed their sub trees and so we just
have to

1030
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
have to
 

1031
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,630
have to
fix the augmentation of those three

1032
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
fix the augmentation of those three
 

1033
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,870
fix the augmentation of those three
things in the easy case it's just two

1034
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
things in the easy case it's just two
 

1035
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,750
things in the easy case it's just two
things

1036
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
things
 

1037
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,350
things
okay all right we have a uh on balance

1038
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
okay all right we have a uh on balance
 

1039
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,430
okay all right we have a uh on balance
how can we fix this

1040
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440

 

1041
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,630

i could have been mean right i wanna be

1042
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640
i could have been mean right i wanna be
 

1043
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,350
i could have been mean right i wanna be
able to

1044
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
able to
 

1045
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,390
able to
right rotate here right to rebalance i

1046
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
right rotate here right to rebalance i
 

1047
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,909
right rotate here right to rebalance i
could have been mean and switch these

1048
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:51,919
could have been mean and switch these
 

1049
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,190
could have been mean and switch these
two

1050
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
two
 

1051
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,990
two
right if i switch those two then i'd

1052
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000
right if i switch those two then i'd
 

1053
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,750
right if i switch those two then i'd
have to do two rotations to fix this

1054
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
have to do two rotations to fix this
 

1055
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,590
have to do two rotations to fix this
thing because the middle one is heavier

1056
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
thing because the middle one is heavier
 

1057
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,150
thing because the middle one is heavier
than the

1058
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
than the
 

1059
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,149
than the
left one against what i'm doing right

1060
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
left one against what i'm doing right
 

1061
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,149
left one against what i'm doing right
but i'm not that mean so i'm going to

1062
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
but i'm not that mean so i'm going to
 

1063
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,549
but i'm not that mean so i'm going to
right rotate how do i do that well right

1064
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
right rotate how do i do that well right
 

1065
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,350
right rotate how do i do that well right
rotate

1066
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
rotate
 

1067
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,630
rotate
at 6 is going to bring all of this

1068
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
at 6 is going to bring all of this
 

1069
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,590
at 6 is going to bring all of this
down below 4 right and stick this

1070
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
down below 4 right and stick this
 

1071
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,310
down below 4 right and stick this
subtree

1072
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
subtree
 

1073
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,630
subtree
as the left child of 6. does that make

1074
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
as the left child of 6. does that make
 

1075
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,750
as the left child of 6. does that make
sense

1076
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
sense
 

1077
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,990
sense
yuck that's going to be fun to draw

1078
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000

 

1079
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,870

i'm just going to redraw it that makes

1080
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
i'm just going to redraw it that makes
 

1081
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,750
i'm just going to redraw it that makes
more sense right

1082
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760

 

1083
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,909

uh eleven three two

1084
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
uh eleven three two
 

1085
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,350
uh eleven three two
one and then six

1086
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360

 

1087
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,190

five nine

1088
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
five nine
 

1089
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,990
five nine
eight twelve

1090
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000

 

1091
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,350

ten that's the right rotation

1092
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
ten that's the right rotation
 

1093
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,230
ten that's the right rotation
at six is everyone cool with this

1094
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
at six is everyone cool with this
 

1095
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,630
at six is everyone cool with this
the rotation my x is 6 my y is 4

1096
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
the rotation my x is 6 my y is 4
 

1097
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,310
the rotation my x is 6 my y is 4
right i have a b c sub trees

1098
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
right i have a b c sub trees
 

1099
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,390
right i have a b c sub trees
right what i'm doing is kind of

1100
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
right what i'm doing is kind of
 

1101
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,350
right what i'm doing is kind of
switching

1102
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360
switching
 

1103
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,510
switching
which of x and y is the root here right

1104
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
which of x and y is the root here right
 

1105
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,350
which of x and y is the root here right
so now y is the root

1106
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
so now y is the root
 

1107
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,870
so now y is the root
and b and c sub trees here now become

1108
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
and b and c sub trees here now become
 

1109
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,470
and b and c sub trees here now become
the children of x

1110
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
the children of x
 

1111
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,270
the children of x
underneath y and notice that hopefully

1112
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,280
underneath y and notice that hopefully
 

1113
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,870
underneath y and notice that hopefully
through all that process

1114
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880
through all that process
 

1115
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,950
through all that process
my inorder traversal has not changed

1116
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
my inorder traversal has not changed
 

1117
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,110
my inorder traversal has not changed
we had to update our augmentations along

1118
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
we had to update our augmentations along
 

1119
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
we had to update our augmentations along
the way but you know it's a constant

1120
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
the way but you know it's a constant
 

1121
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,549
the way but you know it's a constant
every time we walk up the tree

1122
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
every time we walk up the tree
 

1123
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,070
every time we walk up the tree
and we walk up the tree only a

1124
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
and we walk up the tree only a
 

1125
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,549
and we walk up the tree only a
logarithmic number of times yeah

1126
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
logarithmic number of times yeah
 

1127
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,830
logarithmic number of times yeah
yes so every time we do a rotation we

1128
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
yes so every time we do a rotation we
 

1129
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,870
yes so every time we do a rotation we
just like

1130
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
just like
 

1131
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,149
just like
update the augmentation immediately

1132
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
update the augmentation immediately
 

1133
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,350
update the augmentation immediately
afterwards before we do any other

1134
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
afterwards before we do any other
 

1135
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,390
afterwards before we do any other
routine exactly

1136
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
routine exactly
 

1137
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,789
routine exactly
second part updating documentation just

1138
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799
second part updating documentation just
 

1139
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,830
second part updating documentation just
means like

1140
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
means like
 

1141
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,950
means like
updating like the count and the height

1142
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
updating like the count and the height
 

1143
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,630
updating like the count and the height
just the properties and stuff yeah

1144
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
just the properties and stuff yeah
 

1145
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,990
just the properties and stuff yeah
basically what we did we

1146
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,000
basically what we did we
 

1147
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,630
basically what we did we
define when we augmented uh professor

1148
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
define when we augmented uh professor
 

1149
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,669
define when we augmented uh professor
domain yesterday

1150
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
domain yesterday
 

1151
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,830
domain yesterday
defined for you what a subtree property

1152
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
defined for you what a subtree property
 

1153
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,029
defined for you what a subtree property
is right

1154
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
is right
 

1155
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,990
is right
it meant a property that i can compute

1156
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
it meant a property that i can compute
 

1157
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,390
it meant a property that i can compute
only by looking at my children

1158
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
only by looking at my children
 

1159
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,390
only by looking at my children
the augmentations of my children

1160
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
the augmentations of my children
 

1161
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,149
the augmentations of my children
recursively right

1162
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
recursively right
 

1163
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,510
recursively right
so here uh instead of trying to

1164
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
so here uh instead of trying to
 

1165
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,830
so here uh instead of trying to
increment or try to think about locally

1166
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:21,840
increment or try to think about locally
 

1167
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,310
increment or try to think about locally
what this augmentation should be

1168
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
what this augmentation should be
 

1169
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,510
what this augmentation should be
i'm going to throw away my old

1170
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
i'm going to throw away my old
 

1171
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,909
i'm going to throw away my old
augmentation and just recompute it from

1172
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
augmentation and just recompute it from
 

1173
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,190
augmentation and just recompute it from
my children because

1174
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
my children because
 

1175
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,830
my children because
those recursively better be correct does

1176
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
those recursively better be correct does
 

1177
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,710
those recursively better be correct does
that make sense

1178
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
that make sense
 

1179
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,110
that make sense
yeah so just looking at how the rotation

1180
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
yeah so just looking at how the rotation
 

1181
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,390
yeah so just looking at how the rotation
works

1182
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400

 

1183
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,270

so basically you're swapping four and

1184
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
so basically you're swapping four and
 

1185
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,270
so basically you're swapping four and
six so that way four becomes the parent

1186
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
six so that way four becomes the parent
 

1187
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,909
six so that way four becomes the parent
node

1188
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
node
 

1189
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,270
node
and six becomes the right note

1190
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
and six becomes the right note
 

1191
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,390
and six becomes the right note
i'm gonna draw this picture just

i'm gonna draw this picture just
it's just something you gotta memorize

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
it's just something you gotta memorize

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,750
it's just something you gotta memorize
it's

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
it's

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,560
it's
this is x b

can you see that picture okay

1204
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520

 

1205
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,510

yeah it's in your notes it's not a big

1206
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
yeah it's in your notes it's not a big
 

1207
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,549
yeah it's in your notes it's not a big

1208
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
deal right
 

1209
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,830
deal right
but if you've got this structure where

but if you've got this structure where
 

1211
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,870
but if you've got this structure where
x has a left child right

1223
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,230

right but it's got a different shape and

1224
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
right but it's got a different shape and
 

1225
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,510
right but it's got a different shape and
in particular subtree

1226
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
in particular subtree
 

1227
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,149
in particular subtree
heights have changed which means it can

1228
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
heights have changed which means it can
 

1229
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,590
heights have changed which means it can
help us rebalance the tree

1230
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
help us rebalance the tree
 

1231
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,750
help us rebalance the tree
and that's that's the whole point of avl

1232
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
and that's that's the whole point of avl
 

1233
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,029
and that's that's the whole point of avl
does that make sense

1234
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
does that make sense
 

1235
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,070
does that make sense
and that's the right rotation this one

1236
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
and that's the right rotation this one
 

1237
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,950
and that's the right rotation this one
is this is a right rotation this is a

1238
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
is this is a right rotation this is a
 

1239
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,870
is this is a right rotation this is a
left rotation

1240
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
left rotation
 

1241
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:58,070
left rotation
any other questions

1242
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080

 

1243
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,110

so as i'm walking up the tree every node

1244
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
so as i'm walking up the tree every node
 

1245
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,510
so as i'm walking up the tree every node
i might have to fix with the rebalance

1246
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
i might have to fix with the rebalance
 

1247
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,430
i might have to fix with the rebalance
but that rebalance does at most two

1248
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
but that rebalance does at most two
 

1249
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,269
but that rebalance does at most two
rotations

1250
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
rotations
 

1251
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,470
rotations
and there's at most log n ancestors that

1252
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
and there's at most log n ancestors that
 

1253
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,950
and there's at most log n ancestors that
i have

1254
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960
i have
 

1255
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,350
i have
because my tree is height balance right

1256
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
because my tree is height balance right
 

1257
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,430
because my tree is height balance right
at 2 2 log n or something like that

1258
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
at 2 2 log n or something like that
 

1259
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,950
at 2 2 log n or something like that
right

1260
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
right
 

1261
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,909
right
which means that at max i might have to

1262
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
which means that at max i might have to
 

1263
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,390
which means that at max i might have to
do

1264
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
do
 

1265
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,029
do
four log n rotations right because each

1266
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
four log n rotations right because each
 

1267
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,149
four log n rotations right because each
one could

1268
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
one could
 

1269
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,310
one could
do two rotations so that makes sense now

1270
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
do two rotations so that makes sense now
 

1271
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,230
do two rotations so that makes sense now
in actuality you can prove that in a

1272
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
in actuality you can prove that in a
 

1273
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,590
in actuality you can prove that in a
delete operation

1274
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
delete operation
 

1275
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,110
delete operation
it's possible that you have to do a

1276
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
it's possible that you have to do a
 

1277
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,789
it's possible that you have to do a
logarithmic number of these rotations up

1278
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
logarithmic number of these rotations up
 

1279
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,269
logarithmic number of these rotations up
the tree

1280
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
the tree
 

1281
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,070
the tree
this was a that bad case this is called

1282
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
this was a that bad case this is called
 

1283
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,830
this was a that bad case this is called
the original tree i gave you is called a

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
the original tree i gave you is called a
 

1285
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,870
the original tree i gave you is called a

fibonacci tree
 

1287
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,909
fibonacci tree
it's the fewest it's the highest uh

1288
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
it's the fewest it's the highest uh
 

1289
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,990
it's the fewest it's the highest uh
height balanced tree you can have on a

1290
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
height balanced tree you can have on a
 

1291
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,470
height balanced tree you can have on a
on a given number of nodes

1292
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
on a given number of nodes
 

1293
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,549
on a given number of nodes
um uh that's it's

1294
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
um uh that's it's
 

1295
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,390
um uh that's it's
yeah the fewest nodes for a certain

1296
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
yeah the fewest nodes for a certain
 

1297
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,230
yeah the fewest nodes for a certain
height i i you can think of it either

1298
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
height i i you can think of it either
 

1299
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,710
height i i you can think of it either
way

1300
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
way
 

1301
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,310
way
and if you generalize that to a large

1302
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
and if you generalize that to a large
 

1303
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,390
and if you generalize that to a large
enough thing then that thing will take a

1304
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
enough thing then that thing will take a
 

1305
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,630
enough thing then that thing will take a
logarithmic number of rotations going up

1306
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
logarithmic number of rotations going up
 

1307
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,269
logarithmic number of rotations going up
now actually with an insertion you can

1308
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
now actually with an insertion you can
 

1309
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,710
now actually with an insertion you can
actually prove you can go through the

1310
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
actually prove you can go through the
 

1311
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,870
actually prove you can go through the
case analysis

1312
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
case analysis
 

1313
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,110
case analysis
uh an insertion operation will always

1314
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
uh an insertion operation will always
 

1315
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,590
uh an insertion operation will always
rebalance the tree after one

1316
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
rebalance the tree after one
 

1317
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,669
rebalance the tree after one
after one rebalance operation which

1318
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
after one rebalance operation which
 

1319
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,190
after one rebalance operation which
could include two rotations does that

1320
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
could include two rotations does that
 

1321
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:27,190
could include two rotations does that
make sense

1322
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200

 

1323
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,430

yeah so in right rotation this guy

1324
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
yeah so in right rotation this guy
 

1325
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,710
yeah so in right rotation this guy
becomes a right child

1326
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
becomes a right child
 

1327
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,149
becomes a right child
yes

1328
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159

 

1329
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,630

depending on whether you have a child

1330
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640
depending on whether you have a child
 

1331
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,269
depending on whether you have a child
yeah so

1332
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
yeah so
 

1333
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,630
yeah so
if i didn't have a left subtree

1334
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
if i didn't have a left subtree
 

1335
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,950
if i didn't have a left subtree
can't perform rotation a right rotation

1336
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
can't perform rotation a right rotation
 

1337
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,669
can't perform rotation a right rotation
there

1338
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
there
 

1339
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,070
there
yeah so a right rotation necessitates

1340
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
yeah so a right rotation necessitates
 

1341
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,590
yeah so a right rotation necessitates
that i have a left child so if you're

1342
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
that i have a left child so if you're
 

1343
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,390
that i have a left child so if you're
doing it

1344
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
doing it
 

1345
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,710
doing it
and you'll see our code actually checks

1346
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
and you'll see our code actually checks
 

1347
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,710
and you'll see our code actually checks
to make sure you have a left child

1348
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
to make sure you have a left child
 

1349
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,510
to make sure you have a left child
right uh

1350
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
right uh
 

1351
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,510
right uh
that's that's a an assertion that you

1352
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
that's that's a an assertion that you
 

1353
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,950
that's that's a an assertion that you
might want to fire before you ever do

1354
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
might want to fire before you ever do
 

1355
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,870
might want to fire before you ever do
one of these rotations

1356
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:02,880
one of these rotations
 

1357
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,230
one of these rotations
anything else yeah so an insertion may

1358
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
anything else yeah so an insertion may
 

1359
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,870
anything else yeah so an insertion may
take

1360
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880
take
 

1361
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,070
take
two rotations at most to fix a constant

1362
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
two rotations at most to fix a constant
 

1363
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,430
two rotations at most to fix a constant
number of rotations and the deletion

1364
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,440
number of rotations and the deletion
 

1365
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,710
number of rotations and the deletion
could take a logarithmic number of

1366
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
could take a logarithmic number of
 

1367
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,390
could take a logarithmic number of
partitions

1368
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
partitions
 

1369
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,070
partitions
now that's not something you need to

1370
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,080
now that's not something you need to
 

1371
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,669
now that's not something you need to
know it's not something i'm proving here

1372
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
know it's not something i'm proving here
 

1373
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,630
know it's not something i'm proving here
to you

1374
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
to you
 

1375
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,950
to you
uh just just something that's

1376
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960
uh just just something that's
 

1377
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,549
uh just just something that's
interesting there are rebalancing

1378
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
interesting there are rebalancing
 

1379
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,750
interesting there are rebalancing
schemes like

1380
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
schemes like
 

1381
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,029
schemes like
in in clrs right they they introduce

1382
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
in in clrs right they they introduce
 

1383
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,149
in in clrs right they they introduce
a a red black tree to to introduce

1384
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
a a red black tree to to introduce
 

1385
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,190
a a red black tree to to introduce
balance

1386
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
balance
 

1387
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,870
balance
and that those trees actually have a

1388
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
and that those trees actually have a
 

1389
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,710
and that those trees actually have a
weaker bound on

1390
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
weaker bound on
 

1391
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,590
weaker bound on
it's not as is tightly height balanced

1392
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
it's not as is tightly height balanced
 

1393
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,390
it's not as is tightly height balanced
as as an

1394
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
as as an
 

1395
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,669
as as an
avl tree is it allows higher than skew

1396
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
avl tree is it allows higher than skew
 

1397
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,950
avl tree is it allows higher than skew
to right uh and because it's

1398
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:44,960
to right uh and because it's
 

1399
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,470
to right uh and because it's
kind of a weaker restriction they get

1400
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
kind of a weaker restriction they get
 

1401
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,549
kind of a weaker restriction they get
away with only doing a constant number

1402
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
away with only doing a constant number
 

1403
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,710
away with only doing a constant number
of rotations that

1404
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
of rotations that
 

1405
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,510
of rotations that
they can afford that before they fix the

1406
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
they can afford that before they fix the
 

1407
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,230
they can afford that before they fix the
tree

1408
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,240
tree
 

1409
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,669
tree
uh but you know a little more

1410
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
uh but you know a little more
 

1411
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,549
uh but you know a little more
complicated

1412
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559

 

1413
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,909

very nice okay any questions on this

1414
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:05,919
very nice okay any questions on this
 

1415
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,710
very nice okay any questions on this
okay

1416
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
okay
 

1417
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,950
okay
so uh now so this is more of a

1418
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
so uh now so this is more of a
 

1419
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,230
so uh now so this is more of a
mechanical question

1420
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
mechanical question
 

1421
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,909
mechanical question
you'll get on your problem sets and now

1422
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
you'll get on your problem sets and now
 

1423
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,669
you'll get on your problem sets and now
we get more onto the uh

1424
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
we get more onto the uh
 

1425
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,149
we get more onto the uh
the theory type questions these are

1426
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
the theory type questions these are
 

1427
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,789
the theory type questions these are
going to be reduction type questions

1428
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
going to be reduction type questions
 

1429
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,149
going to be reduction type questions
uh okay so this first problem uh

1430
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:22,159
uh okay so this first problem uh
 

1431
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,750
uh okay so this first problem uh
thick nuri uh this is

1432
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
thick nuri uh this is
 

1433
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,669
thick nuri uh this is
anyone nick fury right so it's a

1434
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
anyone nick fury right so it's a
 

1435
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,230
anyone nick fury right so it's a
an avengers reference uh so basically

1436
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
an avengers reference uh so basically
 

1437
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,990
an avengers reference uh so basically
what happens in this thing he's got a

1438
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
what happens in this thing he's got a
 

1439
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,870
what happens in this thing he's got a
list of

1440
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
list of
 

1441
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,430
list of
superheroes uh that each have an opinion

1442
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,440
superheroes uh that each have an opinion
 

1443
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,389
superheroes uh that each have an opinion
on whether they should go fight santa's

1444
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:42,399
on whether they should go fight santa's
 

1445
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,830
on whether they should go fight santa's
okay

1446
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
okay
 

1447
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,350
okay
and uh their opinion

1448
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
and uh their opinion
 

1449
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,510
and uh their opinion
can be strongly positive or strongly

1450
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,520
can be strongly positive or strongly
 

1451
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,549
can be strongly positive or strongly
negative

1452
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:50,559
negative
 

1453
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,230
negative
and so what uh fick is trying to do is

1454
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
and so what uh fick is trying to do is
 

1455
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,830
and so what uh fick is trying to do is
find from among his

1456
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:55,840
find from among his
 

1457
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,590
find from among his
revengers uh what their

1458
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
revengers uh what their
 

1459
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,950
revengers uh what their
what the log n most extreme

1460
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
what the log n most extreme
 

1461
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,950
what the log n most extreme
opinion revengers are so that you can

1462
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:04,960
opinion revengers are so that you can
 

1463
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,549
opinion revengers are so that you can
talk to them right he doesn't want to

1464
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
talk to them right he doesn't want to
 

1465
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,470
talk to them right he doesn't want to
talk to everybody he wants to talk to a

1466
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:08,480
talk to everybody he wants to talk to a
 

1467
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,789
talk to everybody he wants to talk to a
you know logarithmic number of them okay

1468
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
you know logarithmic number of them okay
 

1469
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,230
you know logarithmic number of them okay
it's kind of

1470
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
it's kind of
 

1471
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,430
it's kind of
whatever all right so uh basically

1472
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
whatever all right so uh basically
 

1473
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,710
whatever all right so uh basically
we have a uh a classified situation

1474
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
we have a uh a classified situation
 

1475
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,510
we have a uh a classified situation
where you're given as a read-only input

1476
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,520
where you're given as a read-only input
 

1477
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,630
where you're given as a read-only input
data store

1478
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
data store
 

1479
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,789
data store
of these things in an array okay

1480
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
of these things in an array okay
 

1481
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,149
of these things in an array okay
and i want to find the log n

1482
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:30,159
and i want to find the log n
 

1483
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,710
and i want to find the log n
ones with the strongest opinions does

1484
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:32,720
ones with the strongest opinions does
 

1485
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,990
ones with the strongest opinions does
that make sense

1486
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
that make sense
 

1487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,350
that make sense
and i want to do it and the first

1488
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,360
and i want to do it and the first
 

1489
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,470
and i want to do it and the first
problem is in linear time

1490
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
problem is in linear time
 

1491
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,070
problem is in linear time
okay so you actually don't know how to

1492
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
okay so you actually don't know how to
 

1493
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,630
okay so you actually don't know how to
do this yet

1494
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640

 

1495
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,870

you'll know how to do it with material

1496
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:44,880
you'll know how to do it with material
 

1497
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,750
you'll know how to do it with material
that you cover

1498
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
that you cover
 

1499
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,110
that you cover
in uh well they teach you one way to do

1500
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
in uh well they teach you one way to do
 

1501
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,430
in uh well they teach you one way to do
it in o46 but we're not going to get you

1502
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
it in o46 but we're not going to get you
 

1503
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,389
it in o46 but we're not going to get you
there right now uh we'll teach you

1504
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:54,399
there right now uh we'll teach you
 

1505
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,909
there right now uh we'll teach you
another way to do it

1506
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
another way to do it
 

1507
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,950
another way to do it
uh in uh on tuesday

1508
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
uh in uh on tuesday
 

1509
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,269
uh in uh on tuesday
right which is via binary heaps okay

1510
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
right which is via binary heaps okay
 

1511
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,830
right which is via binary heaps okay
binary heaps are an interesting thing

1512
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
binary heaps are an interesting thing
 

1513
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,149
binary heaps are an interesting thing
that implements a subset

1514
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:10,159

 

1515
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,230

of the set interface okay

1516
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,240
of the set interface okay
 

1517
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,389
of the set interface okay
really it just you can build

1518
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399

 

1519
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,669

on some iterable x okay i

1520
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
on some iterable x okay i
 

1521
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,510
on some iterable x okay i
collect a bunch of things these items

1522
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
collect a bunch of things these items
 

1523
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,110
collect a bunch of things these items
have keys right it's a key

1524
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
have keys right it's a key
 

1525
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,190
have keys right it's a key
data structure in the same way it's

1526
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
data structure in the same way it's
 

1527
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,190
data structure in the same way it's
implementing what we call a priority

1528
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
implementing what we call a priority
 

1529
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,750
implementing what we call a priority
queue interface i can build these things

1530
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
queue interface i can build these things
 

1531
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,430
queue interface i can build these things
i can insert things

1532
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
i can insert things
 

1533
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,590
i can insert things
but i'm not going to do that here all i

1534
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
but i'm not going to do that here all i
 

1535
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,549
but i'm not going to do that here all i
really need here for this

1536
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559
really need here for this
 

1537
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,389
really need here for this
situation is a delete superlative kind

1538
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,399
situation is a delete superlative kind
 

1539
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,990
situation is a delete superlative kind
of operation in this case

1540
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
of operation in this case
 

1541
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,269
of operation in this case
probably max delete

1542
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
probably max delete
 

1543
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,870
probably max delete
max

1544
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:56,880

 

1545
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,190

okay so this is like a i got a data

1546
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
okay so this is like a i got a data
 

1547
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,470
okay so this is like a i got a data
structure

1548
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
structure
 

1549
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,990
structure
right i'm calling these things does that

1550
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
right i'm calling these things does that
 

1551
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,070
right i'm calling these things does that
make sense yeah that's a priority

1552
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
make sense yeah that's a priority
 

1553
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,830
make sense yeah that's a priority
yes a priority queue is essentially

1554
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
yes a priority queue is essentially
 

1555
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,350
yes a priority queue is essentially
something that implements these two

1556
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
something that implements these two
 

1557
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,389
something that implements these two
things

1558
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
things
 

1559
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,750
things
actually there's a third one where i can

1560
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:09,760
actually there's a third one where i can
 

1561
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,750
actually there's a third one where i can
insert a new thing right but i'm not

1562
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
insert a new thing right but i'm not
 

1563
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,029
insert a new thing right but i'm not
going to need that right now

1564
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:13,039
going to need that right now
 

1565
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,630
going to need that right now
so that's what a priority queue is and

1566
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
so that's what a priority queue is and
 

1567
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,950
so that's what a priority queue is and
actually a set this is a subset of the

1568
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:16,960
actually a set this is a subset of the
 

1569
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,430
actually a set this is a subset of the
set

1570
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440
set
 

1571
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,789
set
interface right right the nice thing

1572
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
interface right right the nice thing
 

1573
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,269
interface right right the nice thing
about

1574
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:21,279
about
 

1575
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,510
about
a heap which i won't show you how it's

1576
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:23,520
a heap which i won't show you how it's
 

1577
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,310
a heap which i won't show you how it's
done

1578
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
done
 

1579
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,590
done
right but what a heap can do so

1580
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
right but what a heap can do so
 

1581
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,190
right but what a heap can do so
if i had both of these operations

1582
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
if i had both of these operations
 

1583
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,789
if i had both of these operations
implemented using a

1584
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
implemented using a
 

1585
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,070
implemented using a
set avl tree how long would these things

1586
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
set avl tree how long would these things
 

1587
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,269
set avl tree how long would these things
take me

1588
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279

 

1589
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,110

how long does it take to build a set avl

1590
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
how long does it take to build a set avl
 

1591
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,870
how long does it take to build a set avl
tree

1592
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:46,880

 

1593
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,669

and log in right because essentially i'm

1594
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:49,679
and log in right because essentially i'm
 

1595
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,669
and log in right because essentially i'm
getting a sorted order out of this thing

1596
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:51,679
getting a sorted order out of this thing
 

1597
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,350
getting a sorted order out of this thing
right if i'm inserting these things one

1598
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,360
right if i'm inserting these things one
 

1599
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,110
right if i'm inserting these things one
at a time right

1600
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,120
at a time right
 

1601
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,190
at a time right
or i could sort them and then put them

1602
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
or i could sort them and then put them
 

1603
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,750
or i could sort them and then put them
in a tree in linear time like you saw

1604
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
in a tree in linear time like you saw
 

1605
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,509
in a tree in linear time like you saw
a couple days ago right in recitation

1606
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
a couple days ago right in recitation
 

1607
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,350
a couple days ago right in recitation
but i have to sort them at some point

1608
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,360
but i have to sort them at some point
 

1609
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,190
but i have to sort them at some point
right i'm kind of

1610
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,200
right i'm kind of
 

1611
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,909
right i'm kind of
i need to take at least n log n time

1612
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
i need to take at least n log n time
 

1613
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:10,710
i need to take at least n log n time
because

1614
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
because
 

1615
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,630
because
if i'm going to be able to return their

1616
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,640
if i'm going to be able to return their
 

1617
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,470
if i'm going to be able to return their
order their traversal order in linear

1618
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,480
order their traversal order in linear
 

1619
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,149
order their traversal order in linear
time

1620
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
time
 

1621
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,149
time
and i have this lower bound of m log n

1622
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
and i have this lower bound of m log n
 

1623
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,630
and i have this lower bound of m log n
on sorting i kind of needed to spend and

1624
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
on sorting i kind of needed to spend and
 

1625
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,110
on sorting i kind of needed to spend and
log in

1626
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
log in
 

1627
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,590
log in
time here right and how long would this

1628
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
time here right and how long would this
 

1629
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,789
time here right and how long would this
delete max take

1630
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:26,799

 

1631
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,750

i started so long log in right so it's a

1632
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
i started so long log in right so it's a
 

1633
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,950
i started so long log in right so it's a
set avl tree

1634
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:30,960
set avl tree
 

1635
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,029
set avl tree
where is my max it's the rightmost thing

1636
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
where is my max it's the rightmost thing
 

1637
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,710
where is my max it's the rightmost thing
i can just walk down the thing

1638
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
i can just walk down the thing
 

1639
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,950
i can just walk down the thing
take it off maybe i have to rebalance

1640
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
take it off maybe i have to rebalance
 

1641
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,310
take it off maybe i have to rebalance
but you know that's a login

1642
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,320
but you know that's a login
 

1643
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,389
but you know that's a login
operation right it's the same as like

1644
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:40,399
operation right it's the same as like
 

1645
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,149
operation right it's the same as like
insert last in my substrate

1646
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
insert last in my substrate
 

1647
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,750
insert last in my substrate
right so for a set avl tree

1648
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:45,760
right so for a set avl tree
 

1649
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,870
right so for a set avl tree
this is n log n this is uh log n

1650
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:48,880
this is n log n this is uh log n
 

1651
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,070
this is n log n this is uh log n
right now

1652
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,080
right now
 

1653
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,509
right now
there's another data structure that does

1654
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:53,519
there's another data structure that does
 

1655
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,590
there's another data structure that does
better for one of these operations and

1656
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:55,600
better for one of these operations and
 

1657
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,029
better for one of these operations and
the same for the other one

1658
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
the same for the other one
 

1659
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,789
the same for the other one
that we've learned earlier

1660
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
that we've learned earlier
 

1661
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,630
that we've learned earlier
anyone remember said avl tree didn't

1662
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:04,640
anyone remember said avl tree didn't
 

1663
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,789
anyone remember said avl tree didn't
actually give us anything over

1664
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
actually give us anything over
 

1665
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,830
actually give us anything over
a sorted array in a dynamic

1666
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
a sorted array in a dynamic
 

1667
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,190
a sorted array in a dynamic
array okay so what that did right

1668
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
array okay so what that did right
 

1669
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,070
array okay so what that did right
was we have a we could sort it in n log

1670
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
was we have a we could sort it in n log
 

1671
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,590
was we have a we could sort it in n log
n time using merge sort or something

1672
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:17,600
n time using merge sort or something
 

1673
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,549
n time using merge sort or something
like that

1674
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
like that
 

1675
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,149
like that
and then we could just pop off the last

1676
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:20,159
and then we could just pop off the last
 

1677
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,310
and then we could just pop off the last
one end times right

1678
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
one end times right
 

1679
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,549
one end times right
that would be an amortize i mean if i

1680
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
that would be an amortize i mean if i
 

1681
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,470
that would be an amortize i mean if i
didn't care about

1682
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
didn't care about
 

1683
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,909
didn't care about
taking up that size i could do it in

1684
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:27,919
taking up that size i could do it in
 

1685
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,830
taking up that size i could do it in
worse case constant time i just read off

1686
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:29,840
worse case constant time i just read off
 

1687
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,389
worse case constant time i just read off
the first

1688
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:30,399
the first
 

1689
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,310
the first
the last one i don't need to resize the

1690
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,320
the last one i don't need to resize the
 

1691
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,230
the last one i don't need to resize the
array ever right i can just

1692
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,240
array ever right i can just
 

1693
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,509
array ever right i can just
ignore that does that make sense okay

1694
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
ignore that does that make sense okay
 

1695
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,830
ignore that does that make sense okay
but that's okay if i had a data

1696
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,840
but that's okay if i had a data
 

1697
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,990
but that's okay if i had a data
structure

1698
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,000
structure
 

1699
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,830
structure
that implemented these two operations

1700
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:43,840
that implemented these two operations
 

1701
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,190
that implemented these two operations
can someone tell me a

1702
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,200

 

1703
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,389

uh an algorithm to generate

1704
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399
uh an algorithm to generate
 

1705
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,190
uh an algorithm to generate
fixed list don't worry about running

1706
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
fixed list don't worry about running
 

1707
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,789
fixed list don't worry about running
time right now but that just uses these

1708
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
time right now but that just uses these
 

1709
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,190
time right now but that just uses these
two operations

1710
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200

 

1711
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,430

yeah um so we built the data structure

1712
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
yeah um so we built the data structure
 

1713
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,509
yeah um so we built the data structure
it's ordered from least to greatest for

1714
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
it's ordered from least to greatest for
 

1715
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,630
it's ordered from least to greatest for
absolute value

1716
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:06,640
absolute value
 

1717
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,190
absolute value
so don't don't don't worry about uh

1718
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
so don't don't don't worry about uh
 

1719
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,630
so don't don't don't worry about uh
where things are ordered or anything

1720
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
where things are ordered or anything
 

1721
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,070
where things are ordered or anything
like that i don't tell you how these

1722
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,080
like that i don't tell you how these
 

1723
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,549
like that i don't tell you how these
things

1724
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
things
 

1725
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,950
things
are implemented right all i'm saying is

1726
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:16,960
are implemented right all i'm saying is
 

1727
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,909
are implemented right all i'm saying is
i can

1728
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
i can
 

1729
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,389
i can
i can accept a bunch of these things and

1730
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
i can accept a bunch of these things and
 

1731
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,190
i can accept a bunch of these things and
i can

1732
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
i can
 

1733
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,310
i can
remove the maximum and return it

1734
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
remove the maximum and return it
 

1735
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,470
remove the maximum and return it
okay yeah anyways just build it but make

1736
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:26,480
okay yeah anyways just build it but make
 

1737
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,710
okay yeah anyways just build it but make
sure that you build it such that the

1738
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
sure that you build it such that the
 

1739
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,470
sure that you build it such that the
opinion levels are the absolute value of

1740
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
opinion levels are the absolute value of
 

1741
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,389
opinion levels are the absolute value of
the opinion levels sure okay

1742
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
the opinion levels sure okay
 

1743
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,830
the opinion levels sure okay
so that's that's a nice thing what i'm

1744
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:33,840
so that's that's a nice thing what i'm
 

1745
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,230
so that's that's a nice thing what i'm
going to do as your colleague is saying

1746
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
going to do as your colleague is saying
 

1747
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,710
going to do as your colleague is saying
is i'm going to look through all of the

1748
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:38,720
is i'm going to look through all of the
 

1749
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,149
is i'm going to look through all of the
things in my input i'm going to

1750
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:40,159
things in my input i'm going to
 

1751
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,630
things in my input i'm going to
copy it over to some writable memory

1752
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
copy it over to some writable memory
 

1753
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,190
copy it over to some writable memory
store

1754
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
store
 

1755
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,830
store
okay right that read-only thing is not

1756
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
okay right that read-only thing is not
 

1757
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,909
okay right that read-only thing is not
relevant to this part of the problem

1758
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:47,919
relevant to this part of the problem
 

1759
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:56,870
relevant to this part of the problem
right what i'm going to do is uh

1760
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:56,880

 

1761
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,430

right sorry i'm thinking about your

1762
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
right sorry i'm thinking about your
 

1763
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,710
right sorry i'm thinking about your
problem set that we're writing

1764
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:00,720
problem set that we're writing
 

1765
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,990
problem set that we're writing
and mixing it up okay so uh we copy it

1766
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
and mixing it up okay so uh we copy it
 

1767
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,310
and mixing it up okay so uh we copy it
over

1768
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,320
over
 

1769
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,830
over
to uh our new uh like linear size

1770
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
to uh our new uh like linear size
 

1771
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,629
to uh our new uh like linear size
array right and but instead of putting

1772
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
array right and but instead of putting
 

1773
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,069
array right and but instead of putting
their values there i'm going to put the

1774
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:12,079
their values there i'm going to put the
 

1775
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,589
their values there i'm going to put the
absolute values of their values that

1776
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599
absolute values of their values that
 

1777
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,190
absolute values of their values that
make sense i just check if it's negative

1778
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,200
make sense i just check if it's negative
 

1779
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,710
make sense i just check if it's negative
it is i put the positive thing there

1780
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
it is i put the positive thing there
 

1781
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,190
it is i put the positive thing there
right okay and then and then i

1782
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
right okay and then and then i
 

1783
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,430
right okay and then and then i
stick that array in this build right i

1784
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
stick that array in this build right i
 

1785
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,230
stick that array in this build right i
put that

1786
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,240
put that
 

1787
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,430
put that
there right so that'll take some

1788
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
there right so that'll take some
 

1789
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,829
there right so that'll take some
whatever this build time is and then i

1790
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839
whatever this build time is and then i
 

1791
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,270
whatever this build time is and then i
can

1792
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
can
 

1793
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,349
can
delete max k times or i can delete max

1794
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
delete max k times or i can delete max
 

1795
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,990
delete max k times or i can delete max
some number of times however many things

1796
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,000
some number of times however many things
 

1797
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,629
some number of times however many things
that i need

1798
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
that i need
 

1799
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,190
that i need
right that the if i if i want log n

1800
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
right that the if i if i want log n
 

1801
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,790
right that the if i if i want log n
highest things i can just

1802
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
highest things i can just
 

1803
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,069
highest things i can just
do that log n times right so for this

1804
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
do that log n times right so for this
 

1805
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,470
do that log n times right so for this
if i had such a data structure i could

1806
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
if i had such a data structure i could
 

1807
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,510
if i had such a data structure i could
do this in one run of this operation

1808
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:51,520
do this in one run of this operation
 

1809
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,430
do this in one run of this operation
and log in runs of this operation does

1810
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
and log in runs of this operation does
 

1811
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,030
and log in runs of this operation does
that make sense i can solve this problem

1812
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
that make sense i can solve this problem
 

1813
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,190
that make sense i can solve this problem
reducing to this data structure right

1814
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,200
reducing to this data structure right
 

1815
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,069
reducing to this data structure right
now for a sorted array or a

1816
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
now for a sorted array or a

takes m log in time right the nice thing

1822
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
takes m log in time right the nice thing
 

1823
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,270
takes m log in time right the nice thing
about a binary heap

1824
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,280
about a binary heap
 

1825
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,829
about a binary heap
is it does this operation in linear time

1826
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:19,839

 

1827
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,470

you will see that on tuesday and it does

1828
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,480
you will see that on tuesday and it does
 

1829
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,510
you will see that on tuesday and it does
this operation

1830
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
this operation
 

1831
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,310
this operation
in login time

1832
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,320

 

1833
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,589

okay so how what's the running time

1834
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
okay so how what's the running time
 

1835
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,230
okay so how what's the running time
if i use a heap to binary heap to

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,349
if i use a heap to binary heap to
implement this data structure

1838
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:37,359
implement this data structure
 

1839
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,790

times log n how big is log n squared

1842
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
times log n how big is log n squared
 

1843
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,710
times log n how big is log n squared
log squared n compared to n

1844
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
log squared n compared to n
 

1845
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,790
log squared n compared to n
is smaller right so if i add those two

1846
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,800
is smaller right so if i add those two
 

1847
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,230
is smaller right so if i add those two
running times together it's still linear

1848
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,240
running times together it's still linear
 

1849
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,510
running times together it's still linear
right

1850
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:53,520
right
 

1851
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,589
right
okay so that's how you solve the first

1852
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,599
okay so that's how you solve the first
 

1853
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,870
okay so that's how you solve the first
problem okay

1854
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:56,880
problem okay
 

1855
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,390
problem okay
i didn't have to tell you what a binary

1856
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,400
i didn't have to tell you what a binary
 

1857
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,030
i didn't have to tell you what a binary
heap was or how it did what it did all i

1858
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
heap was or how it did what it did all i
 

1859
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,550
heap was or how it did what it did all i
needed to tell you was that it did this

1860
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,560
needed to tell you was that it did this
 

1861
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,069
needed to tell you was that it did this
operation in linear time

1862
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:04,079
operation in linear time
 

1863
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,910
operation in linear time
and it did this operation login type

1864
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
and it did this operation login type
 

1865
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,190
and it did this operation login type
okay

1866
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200

 

1867
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,630

yeah all right the magic will be shown

1868
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,640
yeah all right the magic will be shown
 

1869
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,270
yeah all right the magic will be shown
to you on tuesday

1870
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
to you on tuesday
 

1871
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,109
to you on tuesday
part b says now suppose fixed computer

1872
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
part b says now suppose fixed computer
 

1873
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,750
part b says now suppose fixed computer
is only allowed to write to at most log

1874
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
is only allowed to write to at most log
 

1875
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,550
is only allowed to write to at most log
and space

1876
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
and space
 

1877
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,069
and space
well okay that's a problem here right

1878
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:24,079
well okay that's a problem here right
 

1879
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,990
well okay that's a problem here right
because we before we copied over

1880
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000
because we before we copied over
 

1881
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,870
because we before we copied over
the entire array filtered it out right

1882
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:32,880
the entire array filtered it out right
 

1883
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,310
the entire array filtered it out right
and then did some operations but we

1884
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:34,320
and then did some operations but we
 

1885
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,829
and then did some operations but we
couldn't even afford this if we couldn't

1886
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
couldn't even afford this if we couldn't
 

1887
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,030
couldn't even afford this if we couldn't
store the whole thing

1888
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,040
store the whole thing
 

1889
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,150
store the whole thing
externally in writable memory right

1890
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,160
externally in writable memory right
 

1891
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,390
externally in writable memory right
okay so we can't do that so in some

1892
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,400
okay so we can't do that so in some
 

1893
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,910
okay so we can't do that so in some
sense this is a more restrictive

1894
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
sense this is a more restrictive
 

1895
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,270
sense this is a more restrictive
environment

1896
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280
environment
 

1897
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,470
environment
right i can do less things

1898
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,480
right i can do less things
 

1899
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,349
right i can do less things
than i could it's a uh it's less

1900
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:51,359
than i could it's a uh it's less
 

1901
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,190
than i could it's a uh it's less
powerful than my previous situation

1902
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,200
powerful than my previous situation
 

1903
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,030
powerful than my previous situation
where i had as much space as i wanted to

1904
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
where i had as much space as i wanted to
 

1905
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,430
where i had as much space as i wanted to
use right

1906
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,440
use right
 

1907
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,870
use right
so it kind of makes sense that

1908
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:00,880
so it kind of makes sense that
 

1909
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,310
so it kind of makes sense that
i maybe couldn't get

1910
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
i maybe couldn't get
 

1911
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,829
i maybe couldn't get
the running time bad that bound that we

1912
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:05,839
the running time bad that bound that we
 

1913
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,349
the running time bad that bound that we
had before right

1914
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:07,359
had before right
 

1915
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,910
had before right
maybe i have to sacrifice something

1916
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:09,920
maybe i have to sacrifice something
 

1917
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,829
maybe i have to sacrifice something
because i'm in a more restrictive

1918
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:11,839
because i'm in a more restrictive
 

1919
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,109
because i'm in a more restrictive
computational setting right okay

1920
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
computational setting right okay
 

1921
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,790
computational setting right okay
now this is something you could solve

1922
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
now this is something you could solve
 

1923
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,310
now this is something you could solve
with binary heaps but you don't have to

1924
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:20,320
with binary heaps but you don't have to
 

1925
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,750
with binary heaps but you don't have to
you could solve it

1926
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:21,760
you could solve it
 

1927
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,750
you could solve it
with uh scent adl trees

1928
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760

 

1929
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,510

as anyone have an idea of how you could

1930
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
as anyone have an idea of how you could
 

1931
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,630
as anyone have an idea of how you could
solve this using a set avl tree

1932
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:32,640
solve this using a set avl tree
 

1933
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,829
solve this using a set avl tree
i'm limited by my number of mice my

1934
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
i'm limited by my number of mice my
 

1935
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,069
i'm limited by my number of mice my
my space is at most log n

1936
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079

 

1937
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,589

yeah all right so how much space does

1938
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599
yeah all right so how much space does
 

1939
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,430
yeah all right so how much space does
this indial tree take

1940
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,440
this indial tree take
 

1941
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,069
this indial tree take
right space right there's constant

1942
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
right space right there's constant
 

1943
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,589
right space right there's constant
number of pointers for each one of these

1944
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599
number of pointers for each one of these
 

1945
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,630
number of pointers for each one of these
nodes

1946
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:48,640
nodes
 

1947
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,670
nodes
right and i'm storing in nodes and space

1948
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
right and i'm storing in nodes and space
 

1949
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,990
right and i'm storing in nodes and space
right basically every data structure

1950
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,000
right basically every data structure
 

1951
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,589
right basically every data structure
we've shown you

1952
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:55,599
we've shown you
 

1953
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,790
we've shown you
takes space the order of the things that

1954
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
takes space the order of the things that
 

1955
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,670
takes space the order of the things that
we're storing

1956
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
we're storing
 

1957
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,230
we're storing
right it's not using additional space it

1958
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
right it's not using additional space it
 

1959
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,109
right it's not using additional space it
might take

1960
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
might take
 

1961
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,670
might take
more time to do certain things but the

1962
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:05,680
more time to do certain things but the
 

1963
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,630
more time to do certain things but the
space is

1964
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,640
space is
 

1965
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,589
space is
you know takes the number of items we're

1966
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:09,599
you know takes the number of items we're
 

1967
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,230
you know takes the number of items we're
storing plus

1968
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,240
storing plus
 

1969
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,670
storing plus
maybe a constant factor right

1970
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:13,680

 

1971
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,950

right so i'm going to draw my input here

1972
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
right so i'm going to draw my input here
 

1973
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,910
right so i'm going to draw my input here
which i can only read i can't write

1974
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:19,920
which i can only read i can't write
 

1975
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,310
which i can only read i can't write
do i give it i'm just going to call it a

1976
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,320
do i give it i'm just going to call it a
 

1977
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,069
do i give it i'm just going to call it a
okay so this is my list

1978
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:26,079

 

1979
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,109

of all the revenger opinions okay i can

1980
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:29,119
of all the revenger opinions okay i can
 

1981
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,510
of all the revenger opinions okay i can
only read it

1982
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,520
only read it
 

1983
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,190
only read it
but my computer can only write to this

1984
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,200
but my computer can only write to this
 

1985
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:42,550
but my computer can only write to this
logarithmic amount of space

1986
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,560

 

1987
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,790

what can i put in that space

1988
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800

 

1989
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,710

well i can i can certainly put log n

1990
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
well i can i can certainly put log n
 

1991
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,190
well i can i can certainly put log n
things in there okay

1992
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
things in there okay
 

1993
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,430
things in there okay
so if i'm given that restriction i

1994
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
so if i'm given that restriction i
 

1995
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,870
so if i'm given that restriction i
probably want to build a data structure

1996
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:56,880
probably want to build a data structure
 

1997
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,750
probably want to build a data structure
of that size

1998
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
of that size
 

1999
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,910
of that size
right you know containing that number of

2000
00:38:59,910 --> 00:38:59,920
right you know containing that number of
 

2001
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,790
right you know containing that number of
things that make sense

2002
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:02,800
things that make sense
 

2003
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,430
things that make sense
because what else are you gonna do right

2004
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,440

 

2005
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,550

okay so i i gave you an idea maybe we

2006
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
okay so i i gave you an idea maybe we
 

2007
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,069
okay so i i gave you an idea maybe we
could use a set avl here

2008
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:12,079
could use a set avl here
 

2009
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,270
could use a set avl here
right i see a logarithm in my answer

2010
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,280
right i see a logarithm in my answer
 

2011
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,150
right i see a logarithm in my answer
right it's very possible that we might

2012
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
right it's very possible that we might
 

2013
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,950
right it's very possible that we might
have

2014
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960
have
 

2015
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,790
have
you know sorted arrays right or set avl

2016
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800
you know sorted arrays right or set avl
 

2017
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,589
you know sorted arrays right or set avl
things those

2018
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
things those
 

2019
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,510
things those
those things give me a log somewhere in

2020
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
those things give me a log somewhere in
 

2021
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,349
those things give me a log somewhere in
my running times right

2022
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
my running times right
 

2023
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,950
my running times right
so kind of makes sense that i might have

2024
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
so kind of makes sense that i might have
 

2025
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,510
so kind of makes sense that i might have
maybe a set avl tree here why why why

2026
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:33,520
maybe a set avl tree here why why why
 

2027
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,750
maybe a set avl tree here why why why
would a set avl tree be helpful for me

2028
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:37,760

 

2029
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,829

yeah because it started and you know you

2030
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:39,839
yeah because it started and you know you
 

2031
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,190
yeah because it started and you know you
have the direct russell order you can

2032
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
have the direct russell order you can
 

2033
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,109
have the direct russell order you can
calculate the traversal order

2034
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:43,119
calculate the traversal order
 

2035
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,390
calculate the traversal order
and insert like anxiety sure i can do

2036
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,400
and insert like anxiety sure i can do
 

2037
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,550
and insert like anxiety sure i can do
all those things but in particular

2038
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
all those things but in particular
 

2039
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,910
all those things but in particular
it's going to help me be able to find

2040
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
it's going to help me be able to find
 

2041
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,670
it's going to help me be able to find
a large one quickly right if i if i

2042
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:55,680
a large one quickly right if i if i
 

2043
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,430
a large one quickly right if i if i
kind of uh have a set of things it's

2044
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
kind of uh have a set of things it's
 

2045
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,910
kind of uh have a set of things it's
going to be

2046
00:39:59,910 --> 00:39:59,920
going to be
 

2047
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,589
going to be
and i and i'm maintaining this data

2048
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:01,599
and i and i'm maintaining this data
 

2049
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,589
and i and i'm maintaining this data
structure by adding things incrementally

2050
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:03,599

2051
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,550

2052
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560
to it
 

2053
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,589
to it
right i can find out what the biggest

2054
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:07,599
right i can find out what the biggest
 

2055
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,550
right i can find out what the biggest
one is

2056
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:08,560
one is
 

2057
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,790
one is
or the smallest one pretty fast right

2058
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:10,800
or the smallest one pretty fast right
 

2059
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,150
or the smallest one pretty fast right
and log in time

2060
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,160
and log in time
 

2061
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,670
and log in time
right so if i have log n things in a

2062
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:15,680
right so if i have log n things in a
 

2063
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,150
right so if i have log n things in a
in a tree here right what's the height

2064
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,160
in a tree here right what's the height
 

2065
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,550
in a tree here right what's the height
of that thing

2066
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,560
of that thing
 

2067
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,430
of that thing
log log n that looks familiar so what

2068
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,440
log log n that looks familiar so what
 

2069
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,550

they're useful because they're balanced
 

2115
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,150
they're useful because they're balanced
so we're going to usually just assume

00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,160
so we're going to usually just assume
 

2117
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,710
so we're going to usually just assume

even have keys how could i
 

2139
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,589
even have keys how could i
store set semantics there right so but

2140
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
store set semantics there right so but
 

2141
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,270
store set semantics there right so but
that's the distinction that we mean when

2142
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
that's the distinction that we mean when
 

2143
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,470
that's the distinction that we mean when
we say

2144
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
we say
 

2145
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,150
we say
uh binary search tree versus

2146
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,160
uh binary search tree versus
 

2147
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,430
uh binary search tree versus
really a set avl tree versus yeah so if

2148
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
really a set avl tree versus yeah so if
 

2149
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,030
really a set avl tree versus yeah so if
we're going to make an avl tree out of

2150
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,040
we're going to make an avl tree out of
 

2151
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,550
we're going to make an avl tree out of
this would that mean that like

2152
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:58,560
this would that mean that like
 

2153
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,710
this would that mean that like
we when we make a node we tell it like

2154
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:00,720
we when we make a node we tell it like
 

2155
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,750
we when we make a node we tell it like
we are keying on the absolute value

2156
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
we are keying on the absolute value
 

2157
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,870
we are keying on the absolute value
okay so when you're uh

2158
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:06,880
okay so when you're uh
 

2159
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,910
okay so when you're uh
making a set to avl tree you got to tell

2160
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:09,920
making a set to avl tree you got to tell
 

2161
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,630
making a set to avl tree you got to tell
us what

2162
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,640
us what
 

2163
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,150
us what
if you're storing objects you got to

2164
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,160
if you're storing objects you got to
 

2165
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,510
if you're storing objects you got to
tell me what their key is right if

2166
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
tell me what their key is right if
 

2167
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,030
tell me what their key is right if
you're just storing some numbers

2168
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
you're just storing some numbers
 

2169
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,309
you're just storing some numbers
like what i'm doing here right now this

2170
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
like what i'm doing here right now this
 

2171
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,150
like what i'm doing here right now this
isn't a set avl tree right but if i'm

2172
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
isn't a set avl tree right but if i'm
 

2173
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,270
isn't a set avl tree right but if i'm
just storing numbers

2174
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
just storing numbers
 

2175
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,630
just storing numbers
i have to tell you the items that i'm

2176
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:22,640
i have to tell you the items that i'm
 

2177
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,309
i have to tell you the items that i'm
storing are the keys

2178
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:24,319
storing are the keys
 

2179
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,870
storing are the keys
okay and then everything follows right

2180
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:26,880
okay and then everything follows right
 

2181
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,150
okay and then everything follows right
but if you've got an object that you're

2182
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
but if you've got an object that you're
 

2183
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,190
but if you've got an object that you're
trying to sort like

2184
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
trying to sort like
 

2185
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,030
trying to sort like
the students in this room you got a lot

2186
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
the students in this room you got a lot
 

2187
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,230
the students in this room you got a lot
of properties

2188
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240
of properties
 

2189
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,430
of properties
right i want to all the uh

2190
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,440
right i want to all the uh
 

2191

00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
the people with phone number right
 

2193
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,910
the people with phone number right
maybe i want to key you on phone number

2194
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
maybe i want to key you on phone number
 

2195
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,630
maybe i want to key you on phone number
for some reason that's going to help me

2196
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:42,640
for some reason that's going to help me
 

2197

for some reason that's going to help me
find out where you live i don't know

2198
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,640
find out where you live i don't know
 

2199
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,309
find out where you live i don't know
this is getting i don't want to go there

2200
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
this is getting i don't want to go there
 

2201
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:46,870
this is getting i don't want to go there
okay

2202
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
okay
 

2203
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,829
okay
so but if i if i give you a set to avl

2204
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:49,839
so but if i if i give you a set to avl
 

2205
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:50,550
so but if i if i give you a set to avl
tree

2206
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
tree
 

2207
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,910
tree
i got to tell you what it's keyed on if

2208
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:51,920
i got to tell you what it's keyed on if
 

2209
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,309
i got to tell you what it's keyed on if
i give you a sequence avl tree

2210
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
i give you a sequence avl tree
 

2211
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,589
i give you a sequence avl tree
right it's obvious what my traversal

2212
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
right it's obvious what my traversal
 

2213
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,870
right it's obvious what my traversal
order is going to be because i'm giving

2214
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
order is going to be because i'm giving
 

2215
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,910
order is going to be because i'm giving
you a sequence

2216
00:42:59,910 --> 00:42:59,920
you a sequence
 

2217
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,470
you a sequence
right that's what the input gate was

2218
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
right that's what the input gate was
 

2219
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,510
right that's what the input gate was
right

2220
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:03,520
right
 

2221
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,750
right
does that make sense all right so i've

2222
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
does that make sense all right so i've
 

2223
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,870
does that make sense all right so i've
got this

2224
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
got this
 

2225
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,069
got this
set avl tree of size log n

2226
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
set avl tree of size log n
 

2227
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,670
set avl tree of size log n
what should it be keyed by

2228
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:13,680
what should it be keyed by
 

2229
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,829
what should it be keyed by
absolute value of their preference right

2230
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
absolute value of their preference right
 

2231
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,349
absolute value of their preference right
or of their

2232
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359
or of their
 

2233
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,870
or of their
opinion i don't remember what this is

2234
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:18,880
opinion i don't remember what this is
 

2235
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,630
opinion i don't remember what this is
called so

2236
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,640
called so
 

2237
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:28,150
called so
but i what log n things do i put in here

2238
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,160

 

2239
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,270

i don't know i i don't know anything

2240
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
i don't know i i don't know anything
 

2241
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,069
i don't know i i don't know anything
about these things

2242
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:32,079
about these things
 

2243
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,109
about these things
what makes one better than another right

2244
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:35,119
what makes one better than another right
 

2245
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,910
what makes one better than another right
let's just put the first log in things

2246
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:37,920
let's just put the first log in things
 

2247
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,589
let's just put the first log in things
that make sense

2248
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:39,599
that make sense
 

2249
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,270
that make sense
all right what could that

2250
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,280

 

2251
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,270

tell me now i've put this thing in it

2252
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,280
tell me now i've put this thing in it
 

2253
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,589
tell me now i've put this thing in it
how long did that take

2254
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599

 

2255
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,990

log n times log log n

2256
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:54,000
log n times log log n
 

2257
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,950
log n times log log n
time right but that's much less than our

2258
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:56,960
time right but that's much less than our
 

2259
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,390
time right but that's much less than our
running time right so

2260
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:58,400
running time right so
 

2261
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,230
running time right so
that we're looking for so i don't really

2262
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,240
that we're looking for so i don't really
 

2263
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,510
that we're looking for so i don't really
care right

2264
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
care right
 

2265
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,910
care right
i mean i want you to say how long it

2266
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
i mean i want you to say how long it
 

2267
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,630
i mean i want you to say how long it
took

2268
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:04,640
took
 

2269
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,390
took
but for my purposes i know that it's

2270
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:06,400
but for my purposes i know that it's
 

2271
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,750
but for my purposes i know that it's
lower than the running time i'm looking

2272
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:07,760
lower than the running time i'm looking
 

2273
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:07,990
lower than the running time i'm looking
for

2274
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
for
 

2275
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,309
for
so and i did that operation once i don't

2276
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
so and i did that operation once i don't
 

2277
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,750
so and i did that operation once i don't
really care about it anymore

2278
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
really care about it anymore
 

2279
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,109
really care about it anymore
okay yep how did you get log n because

2280
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:15,119
okay yep how did you get log n because
 

2281
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,870
okay yep how did you get log n because
the number of things i'm storing in this

2282
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
the number of things i'm storing in this
 

2283
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,870
the number of things i'm storing in this
thing is log n

2284
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:18,880
thing is log n
 

2285
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,990
thing is log n
and so if i pattern match

2286
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,000
and so if i pattern match
 

2287
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,230
and so if i pattern match
the build time of an avl tree and i

2288
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,240
the build time of an avl tree and i
 

2289
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,150
the build time of an avl tree and i
stick log n in there

2290
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,160
stick log n in there
 

2291
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,270
stick log n in there
right then it's log n times log log n

2292
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,280
right then it's log n times log log n
 

2293
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,349
right then it's log n times log log n
gotcha okay so is that for one iteration

2294
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
gotcha okay so is that for one iteration
 

2295
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,790
gotcha okay so is that for one iteration
well right now i've just built this

2296
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:34,800
well right now i've just built this
 

2297
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,710
well right now i've just built this
thing right

2298
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
thing right
 

2299
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,829
thing right
maybe i uh well i just built it once

2300
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
maybe i uh well i just built it once
 

2301
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,829
maybe i uh well i just built it once
uh i'm asserting too that maybe i don't

2302
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:41,839
uh i'm asserting too that maybe i don't
 

2303
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,430
uh i'm asserting too that maybe i don't
need to build it again

2304
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:43,440
need to build it again
 

2305
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,309
need to build it again
right what could i do instead so right

2306
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:46,319
right what could i do instead so right
 

2307
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:46,950
right what could i do instead so right
now

2308
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:46,960
now
 

2309
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,790
now
i know i haven't filtered my data at all

2310
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:50,800
i know i haven't filtered my data at all
 

2311
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,870
i know i haven't filtered my data at all
right i'm just storing these things in

2312
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:52,880
right i'm just storing these things in
 

2313
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,150
right i'm just storing these things in
sorted order in some way

2314
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:54,160
sorted order in some way
 

2315
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,910
sorted order in some way
right what can i do

2316
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,920
right what can i do
 

2317
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,069
right what can i do
to maybe start processing the rest of

2318
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:00,079
to maybe start processing the rest of
 

2319
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,589
to maybe start processing the rest of

the data
 

2321
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,309
the data
yeah well i didn't like try to scroll

2322
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
yeah well i didn't like try to scroll
 

2323
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,510
yeah well i didn't like try to scroll
through

through
the list a and try to like remind

2326
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,160
the list a and try to like remind
 

2327
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,430

someone that's bigger than

2328
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:09,440
someone that's bigger than
 

2329
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,790
someone that's bigger than
like try to keep the maximum ah

2330
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:12,800
like try to keep the maximum ah
 

2331
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,190
like try to keep the maximum ah
kind of sweep this guy over inserting

2332
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,200
kind of sweep this guy over inserting
 

2333
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,069
kind of sweep this guy over inserting
things

2334
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,079
things
 

2335
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,510
things
and always maintaining you know if i do

2336
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,520
and always maintaining you know if i do
 

2337
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,349
and always maintaining you know if i do
that and i keep sticking things in

2338
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
that and i keep sticking things in
 

2339
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,270
that and i keep sticking things in
i'll have this sorted thing at the end

2340
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,280
i'll have this sorted thing at the end
 

2341
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,230
i'll have this sorted thing at the end
and now i can just read off the

2342
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
and now i can just read off the
 

2343
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,510
and now i can just read off the
biggest k things right however

2344
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
biggest k things right however
 

2345
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,270
biggest k things right however
as i'm inserting things across here

2346
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:33,280
as i'm inserting things across here
 

2347
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,670
as i'm inserting things across here
my thing's growing i'll just delete this

2348
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:35,680
my thing's growing i'll just delete this
 

2349
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,870
my thing's growing i'll just delete this
oh delete small is fun

2350
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
oh delete small is fun
 

2351
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,829
oh delete small is fun
i like that idea right basically yeah

2352
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:39,839
i like that idea right basically yeah
 

2353
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,510
i like that idea right basically yeah
basically replace it right so

2354
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:41,520
basically replace it right so
 

2355
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,630
basically replace it right so
what i'm going to do here's a proposal

2356
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
what i'm going to do here's a proposal
 

2357
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,430
what i'm going to do here's a proposal
we're going to take the next guy stick

2358
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
we're going to take the next guy stick
 

2359
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,950
we're going to take the next guy stick
it in

2360
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
it in
 

2361
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,829
it in
awesome which one don't i care about now

2362
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:53,839
awesome which one don't i care about now
 

2363
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,990
awesome which one don't i care about now
the smallest one there so kick the

2364
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,000
the smallest one there so kick the
 

2365
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,750
the smallest one there so kick the
smallest one out

2366
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
smallest one out
 

2367
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,230
smallest one out
now this one that i stuck in may be the

2368
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:00,240
now this one that i stuck in may be the
 

2369
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,950
now this one that i stuck in may be the
smallest

2370
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
smallest
 

2371
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,550
smallest
right so i just kind of passed it

2372
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:02,560
right so i just kind of passed it
 

2373
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,150
right so i just kind of passed it
through this thing but how long did that

2374
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,160
through this thing but how long did that
 

2375
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,910
through this thing but how long did that
take me

2376
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:09,920

 

2377
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,270

it took me the height of this tree

2378
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:11,280
it took me the height of this tree
 

2379
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,589
it took me the height of this tree
what's the height of the tree log log n

2380
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:13,599
what's the height of the tree log log n
 

2381
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,589
what's the height of the tree log log n
right so i put one in

2382
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:17,599
right so i put one in
 

2383
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,710
right so i put one in
i pop one out that's the smallest right

2384
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
i pop one out that's the smallest right
 

2385
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,150
i pop one out that's the smallest right
and i keep doing that all the way down

2386
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,160
and i keep doing that all the way down
 

2387
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,550
and i keep doing that all the way down
the thing how long did that take

2388
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:28,560
the thing how long did that take
 

2389
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,589
the thing how long did that take
yeah i'm processing n minus log n

2390
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:31,599
yeah i'm processing n minus log n
 

2391
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,790
yeah i'm processing n minus log n
things which is basically n right

2392
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:34,800
things which is basically n right
 

2393
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,870
things which is basically n right
and each one of those operations took me

2394
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:36,880
and each one of those operations took me
 

2395
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,790
and each one of those operations took me
height of the tree time

2396
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800
height of the tree time
 

2397
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,630
height of the tree time
so that gives me the running time that

2398
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:40,640
so that gives me the running time that
 

2399
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,470
so that gives me the running time that
we're looking for

2400
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:42,480
we're looking for
 

2401
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,829
we're looking for
and log log

2402
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
and log log
 

2403
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,589
and log log
yeah it's like recognition of like a

2404
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
yeah it's like recognition of like a
 

2405
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,829
yeah it's like recognition of like a
slide yeah it's a kind of a sliding

2406
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:49,839
slide yeah it's a kind of a sliding
 

2407
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,750
slide yeah it's a kind of a sliding
window technique you may have

2408
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:51,760
window technique you may have
 

2409
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,470
window technique you may have
been using one recently

2410
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
been using one recently
 

2411
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,109
been using one recently

in i'm
 

2465
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,109
in i'm
you know keeping track of which revenger

2466
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119
you know keeping track of which revenger
 

2467
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,950
you know keeping track of which revenger
it is and that i'm taking the absolute

2468
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
it is and that i'm taking the absolute
 

2469
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,230
it is and that i'm taking the absolute
value and all those

2470
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,240
value and all those
 

2471
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,470
value and all those
you know nitty-gritty kind of things but

2472
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
you know nitty-gritty kind of things but
 

2473
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,150
you know nitty-gritty kind of things but
that's the basic idea right

2474
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,160
that's the basic idea right
 

2475
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,230
that's the basic idea right
i'm just taking this i'm sliding the

of the ones that i've processed so far
 

2497
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,990
of the ones that i've processed so far
right that's obviously true at the

2498
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
right that's obviously true at the
 

2499
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,750
right that's obviously true at the
beginning when i build this thing

2500
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:27,760
beginning when i build this thing
 

2501
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,829
beginning when i build this thing
and when i get to the end i've processed

2502
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:29,839
and when i get to the end i've processed
 

2503
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:30,870
and when i get to the end i've processed
all the things

2504
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
all the things
 

2505
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,230
all the things
so and this has size log n and so

2506
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,240
so and this has size log n and so
 

2507
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,910
so and this has size log n and so
i have the log n largest

2508
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:37,920
i have the log n largest
 

2509
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,670
i have the log n largest
like highest extremist opinions

2510
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
like highest extremist opinions
 

2511
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,349
like highest extremist opinions
and then i can just do an inorder

2512
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
and then i can just do an inorder
 

2513
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,950
and then i can just do an inorder
traversal of this thing and read

2514
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:44,960
traversal of this thing and read
 

2515
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,430
traversal of this thing and read
and return does that make sense and i've

2516
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:47,440
and return does that make sense and i've
 

2517
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,790
and return does that make sense and i've
only used

2518
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:48,800
only used
 

2519
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,309
only used
logarithmic space

2520
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:52,319

 

2521
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,790

okay yeah so i don't get it are all the

2522
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
okay yeah so i don't get it are all the
 

2523
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,990
okay yeah so i don't get it are all the
opinions in that uh

2524
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000
opinions in that uh
 

2525
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,309
opinions in that uh
are all the opinions in that avl tree

2526
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:02,319
are all the opinions in that avl tree
 

2527
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,309
are all the opinions in that avl tree
all of these opinions are in the abl

2528
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
all of these opinions are in the abl
 

2529
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,430
all of these opinions are in the abl
tree

2530
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
tree
 

2531
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,470
tree
and at ever at some point

2532
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:08,480
and at ever at some point
 

2533
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,510
and at ever at some point
i will insert every

2534
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:11,520
i will insert every
 

2535
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,630
i will insert every
opinion into this abl tree but i'll

2536
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,640
opinion into this abl tree but i'll
 

2537
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,190
opinion into this abl tree but i'll
be removing the ones that i don't care

2538
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
be removing the ones that i don't care
 

2539
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,150
be removing the ones that i don't care
about as i go

2540
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:18,160
about as i go
 

2541
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,510
about as i go
does that make sense i'm always

2542
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
does that make sense i'm always
 

2543
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,750
does that make sense i'm always
maintaining the

2544
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:21,760
maintaining the
 

2545
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,630
maintaining the
the invariant that this thing before i

2546
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:24,640
the invariant that this thing before i
 

2547
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,910
the invariant that this thing before i
insert something

2548
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:25,920
insert something
 

2549
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,790
insert something
has exactly log n items in it and then

2550
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:28,800
has exactly log n items in it and then
 

2551
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,990
has exactly log n items in it and then
i'm maintaining that invariant

2552
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:30,000
i'm maintaining that invariant
 

2553
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,790
i'm maintaining that invariant
by sticking one in taking one out oh

2554
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:32,800
by sticking one in taking one out oh
 

2555
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,190
by sticking one in taking one out oh
okay so then which one are you

2556
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
okay so then which one are you
 

2557
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,950
okay so then which one are you
always the min right because i'm wanting

2558
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
always the min right because i'm wanting
 

2559
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,630
always the min right because i'm wanting
the the largest ones

2560
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
the the largest ones
 

2561
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,990
the the largest ones
and the mid by absolute value but yeah

2562
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:42,000
and the mid by absolute value but yeah
 

2563
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,990
and the mid by absolute value but yeah
so i'm keying by the absolute value of

2564
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
so i'm keying by the absolute value of
 

2565
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,390
so i'm keying by the absolute value of
these opinions

2566
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:48,400

 

2567
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,349

total run time here right it's

2568
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:51,359
total run time here right it's
 

2569
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,470
total run time here right it's
bookkeeping right

2570
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
bookkeeping right
 

2571
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,390
bookkeeping right
so it took me

2572
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,400

 

2573
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,069

a log n times log

2574
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:00,079
a log n times log
 

2575
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,470
a log n times log
log and time to build this data

2576
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:02,480
log and time to build this data
 

2577
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,069
log and time to build this data
structure at the beginning

2578
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:04,079
structure at the beginning
 

2579
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,670
structure at the beginning
right plus n times

2580
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
right plus n times
 

2581
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,870
right plus n times
log log n

2582
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:10,880
log log n
 

2583
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,829
log log n
i did you know basically n operation

2584
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
i did you know basically n operation
 

2585
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:14,870
i did you know basically n operation
asymptotically and

2586
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
asymptotically and
 

2587
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,390
asymptotically and
operations this way it's actually n

2588
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:16,400
operations this way it's actually n
 

2589
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,990
operations this way it's actually n
minus log n

2590
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:18,000
minus log n
 

2591
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,390
minus log n
operations right and each one of those

2592
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,400
operations right and each one of those
 

2593
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,630
operations right and each one of those
operations tree operations

2594
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
operations tree operations
 

2595
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,190
operations tree operations
you know doing one insert one delete

2596
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:25,200
you know doing one insert one delete
 

2597
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,069
you know doing one insert one delete
each one of those

2598
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
each one of those
 

2599
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,510
each one of those
took the height of the tree time and so

2600
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
took the height of the tree time and so
 

2601
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,710
took the height of the tree time and so
this is that good

2602
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:32,720
this is that good
 

2603
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,430
this is that good
yeah if instead of blind we just insert

2604
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:35,440
yeah if instead of blind we just insert
 

2605
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,549
yeah if instead of blind we just insert
and do we

2606
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
and do we
 

2607
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,430
and do we
do a comparison and then so the in

2608
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
do a comparison and then so the in
 

2609
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,309
do a comparison and then so the in
inserting and deleting

2610
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:42,319
inserting and deleting
 

2611
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,950
inserting and deleting
uh a set avl tree is actually doing

2612
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:44,960
uh a set avl tree is actually doing
 

2613
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,870
uh a set avl tree is actually doing
comparisons within its data structure

2614
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:46,880
comparisons within its data structure
 

2615
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,390
comparisons within its data structure
just compare with the name sure you

2616
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:48,400
just compare with the name sure you
 

2617
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,190
just compare with the name sure you
could do that

2618
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200
could do that
 

2619
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,430
could do that
right right so you could i could do it

2620
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:51,440
right right so you could i could do it
 

2621
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,309
right right so you could i could do it
the other way right

2622
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
the other way right
 

2623
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,630
the other way right
i could remove the smallest element here

2624
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:56,640
i could remove the smallest element here
 

2625
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,670
i could remove the smallest element here
to start with

2626
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:57,680
to start with
 

2627
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,150
to start with
right and then i compare it with this

2628
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,160
right and then i compare it with this
 

2629
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,790
right and then i compare it with this
guy

2630
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:00,800
guy
 

2631
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,390
guy
and then whichever is bigger i stick it

2632
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
and then whichever is bigger i stick it
 

2633
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,309
and then whichever is bigger i stick it
back in

2634
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:04,319
back in
 

2635
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,030
back in
same thing right it's just am i doing

2636
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
same thing right it's just am i doing
 

2637
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,309
same thing right it's just am i doing
the delete first and then

2638
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
the delete first and then
 

2639
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,670
the delete first and then
then the insertion or i'm doing the

2640
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
then the insertion or i'm doing the
 

2641
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,790
then the insertion or i'm doing the
insertion first and then the deletion

2642
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800
insertion first and then the deletion
 

2643
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,589
insertion first and then the deletion
any other questions lots of questions

2644
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
any other questions lots of questions
 

2645
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,790
any other questions lots of questions
all right well i'm probably gonna have

2646
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:16,800
all right well i'm probably gonna have
 

2647
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,470
all right well i'm probably gonna have
to skip the problem

2648
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:18,480
to skip the problem
 

2649
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,069
to skip the problem
uh we're gonna move on to uh c

2650
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
uh we're gonna move on to uh c
 

2651
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,270
uh we're gonna move on to uh c
s so now s c l r

2652
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
s so now s c l r
 

2653
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,069
s so now s c l r
all right what's the reference here

2654
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079

 

2655
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,710

yeah clrs right so these are four

2656
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:32,720
yeah clrs right so these are four
 

2657
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,470
yeah clrs right so these are four
academics who wrote a popular textbook

2658
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:34,480
academics who wrote a popular textbook
 

2659
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,390
academics who wrote a popular textbook
in computer science

2660
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:36,400
in computer science
 

2661
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,710
in computer science
uh okay this is the same kind of k kind

2662
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720

they can change it during the bidding
 

2681
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,910
they can change it during the bidding
period but

2682
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:57,920
period but
 

2683

i'll get by selling to the k highest

2692
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,520
i'll get by selling to the k highest
 

2693
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,349
i'll get by selling to the k highest
bidders does that make sense

2694
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:13,359

 

2695
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,549

yeah okay so
note that before i

2698
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,240
note that before i
 

2699
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,270
note that before i
build this data structure i know what k

2700
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
build this data structure i know what k
 

2701
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,950
build this data structure i know what k
is k is a fixed thing

2702
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:24,960
is k is a fixed thing
 

2703
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,470
is k is a fixed thing
right right because my my running time

2704
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:28,480
right right because my my running time
 

2705
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,670
right right because my my running time
of this get revenue

2706
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:29,680
of this get revenue
 

2707
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,230
of this get revenue
depends on this k it's not an input to

2708
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,240
depends on this k it's not an input to
 

2709
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,270
depends on this k it's not an input to
that operation

2710
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:33,280
that operation
 

2711
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,309
that operation
right so k is kind of i don't know what

2712
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:36,319
right so k is kind of i don't know what
 

2713
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:36,710
right so k is kind of i don't know what
it is

2714
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
it is
 

2715
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,750
it is
a priori it could be n over 2 it could

2716
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:39,760
a priori it could be n over 2 it could
 

2717
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,430
a priori it could be n over 2 it could
be log n

2718
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:41,440
be log n
 

2719
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,829
be log n
right it could be 1

2720
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:44,839
right it could be 1
 

2721
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,069
right it could be 1
right but the data structure i build

2722
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:48,079
right but the data structure i build
 

2723
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,910
right but the data structure i build
needs to satisfy these running time

2724
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
needs to satisfy these running time
 

2725
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,790
needs to satisfy these running time
properties no matter what choice okay

2726
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,800

and you know those updates can take
 

2741
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,670
and you know those updates can take
longer time

2742
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
longer time
 

2743
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,710

00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:47,839
things that i care about is changing all
 

2829
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:48,390
things that i care about is changing all
the time

2830
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:48,400
the time
 

2831
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,829
the time
so that's probably going to steer me

2832
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:49,839
so that's probably going to steer me
 

2833
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,750
so that's probably going to steer me
away from sorted arrays because

2834
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:51,760
away from sorted arrays because
 

2835
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,870
away from sorted arrays because
they're not good with dynamic operations

2836
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:54,880
they're not good with dynamic operations
 

2837
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,789
they're not good with dynamic operations
okay so i'm going to need some kind of

2838
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:56,799
okay so i'm going to need some kind of
 

2839
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,069
okay so i'm going to need some kind of
dictionary on

2840
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
dictionary on
 

2841
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,430
dictionary on
bitter ids but i'm also going to need to

2842
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:01,440
bitter ids but i'm also going to need to
 

2843
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,549
bitter ids but i'm also going to need to
maintain the the sum

2844
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:04,559
maintain the the sum
 

2845
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,109
maintain the the sum
right of the k highest bidders does that

2846
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:07,119
right of the k highest bidders does that
 

2847
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,230
right of the k highest bidders does that
make sense

2848
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
make sense
 

2849
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,309
make sense
right and so in some sense i need to

2850
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:10,319
right and so in some sense i need to
 

2851
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,349
right and so in some sense i need to
keep track of

2852
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:13,359
keep track of
 

2853
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,789
keep track of
an ordered notion of

2854
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:16,799
an ordered notion of
 

2855
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,030
an ordered notion of
the bidders right the bids that are in

2856
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
the bidders right the bids that are in
 

2857
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,589
the bidders right the bids that are in
my data structure does that make sense

2858
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:21,599
my data structure does that make sense
 

2859
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,349
my data structure does that make sense
right so order is going to be important

2860
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
right so order is going to be important
 

2861
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,430
right so order is going to be important
on the bids i'm going to need to look up

2862
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:25,440
on the bids i'm going to need to look up
 

2863
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,230
on the bids i'm going to need to look up
on bitter id

2864
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240

 

2865
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,349

and that's about it right

2866
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:31,359
and that's about it right
 

2867
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:38,470
and that's about it right
okay yeah just checking so something

2868
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480

 

2869
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,309

yes correct yeah so uh

2870
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:42,319
yes correct yeah so uh
 

2871
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,230
yes correct yeah so uh
that's a very good observation right if

2872
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
that's a very good observation right if
 

2873
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,430
that's a very good observation right if
it runs in worst case

2874
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:45,440
it runs in worst case
 

2875
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,670
it runs in worst case
time it also runs unexpected that time

2876
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:47,680
time it also runs unexpected that time
 

2877
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,270
time it also runs unexpected that time
right because there's essentially no

2878
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
right because there's essentially no
 

2879
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,870
right because there's essentially no
randomization that i'm talking about

2880
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
randomization that i'm talking about
 

2881
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,789
randomization that i'm talking about
here right

2882
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:54,799

 

2883
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,630

yeah it's so there's a stronger notion

2884
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
yeah it's so there's a stronger notion
 

2885
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,710
yeah it's so there's a stronger notion
which we want you to specify

2886
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:58,720
which we want you to specify
 

2887
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,789
which we want you to specify
which that actually there is no

2888
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
which that actually there is no
 

2889
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,230
which that actually there is no
randomization here we're not using a

2890
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,240
randomization here we're not using a
 

2891
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,589
randomization here we're not using a
hash table

2892
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:03,599
hash table
 

2893
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,349
hash table
right in this class that really that's

2894
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:05,359
right in this class that really that's
 

2895
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,510
right in this class that really that's
the only situation where

2896
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:07,520
the only situation where
 

2897
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,630
the only situation where
uh that's going to be an issue right uh

2898
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
uh that's going to be an issue right uh
 

2899
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,430
uh that's going to be an issue right uh
so

2900
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:11,440
so
 

2901
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,710
so
uh but if it is uh what this problem is

2902
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:14,720
uh but if it is uh what this problem is
 

2903
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,349
uh but if it is uh what this problem is
saying

2904
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
saying
 

2905
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,710
saying
uh for each other state whether your

2906
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
uh for each other state whether your
 

2907
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,470
uh for each other state whether your
running time is worst case expected

2908
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:18,480
running time is worst case expected
 

2909
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,789
running time is worst case expected
and or amortized what we're really

2910
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
and or amortized what we're really
 

2911
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,230
and or amortized what we're really
trying to get you to say is

2912
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
trying to get you to say is
 

2913
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,150
trying to get you to say is
what's the uh

2914
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
what's the uh
 

2915
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,510
what's the uh
evaluate the running time of your

2916
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,520
evaluate the running time of your
 

2917
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,670
evaluate the running time of your
algorithm with the proper qualifications

2918
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:29,680
algorithm with the proper qualifications
 

2919
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,789
algorithm with the proper qualifications
right

2920
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
right
 

2921
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,390
right
if it took worst case i want you to say

2922
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
if it took worst case i want you to say
 

2923
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,950
if it took worst case i want you to say
that it took worst case

2924
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,960
that it took worst case
 

2925
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,230
that it took worst case
if it took if you use the hash table i

2926
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:38,240
if it took if you use the hash table i
 

2927
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,510
if it took if you use the hash table i
want you to say expected

2928
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:39,520
want you to say expected
 

2929
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,309
want you to say expected
and if these operations i were sometimes

2930
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:42,319
and if these operations i were sometimes
 

2931
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,670
and if these operations i were sometimes
really bad

2932
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:43,680
really bad
 

2933
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,589
really bad
but on average they're really good if i

2934
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
but on average they're really good if i
 

2935
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,870
but on average they're really good if i
did a lot of them that's that's

2936
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
did a lot of them that's that's
 

2937
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,109
did a lot of them that's that's
amortized right

2938
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:49,119
amortized right
 

2939
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,589
amortized right
right or if i reduce to using a dynamic

2940
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
right or if i reduce to using a dynamic
 

2941
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,549
right or if i reduce to using a dynamic
array

2942
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:52,559
array
 

2943
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,309
array
right or if i reduce to using a hash

2944
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:54,319
right or if i reduce to using a hash
 

2945
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,470
right or if i reduce to using a hash
table those dynamic operations would

2946
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
table those dynamic operations would
 

2947
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,430
table those dynamic operations would
still be amortized right

2948
00:56:59,430 --> 00:56:59,440
still be amortized right
 

2949
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,549
still be amortized right
okay so the dynamic ones uh nice thing

2950
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:02,559
okay so the dynamic ones uh nice thing
 

2951
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,270
okay so the dynamic ones uh nice thing
about

2952
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,280
about
 

2953
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,349
about
linked data structures is that dynamic

2954
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
linked data structures is that dynamic
 

2955
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,190
linked data structures is that dynamic
operations aren't amortized right

2956
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
operations aren't amortized right
 

2957
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,870
operations aren't amortized right
so we're gonna get be able to get now

2958
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,880
so we're gonna get be able to get now
 

2959
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,630
so we're gonna get be able to get now
for this problem we can actually get

2960
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,640
for this problem we can actually get
 

2961
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,630
for this problem we can actually get
worst case bounds so we're going to try

2962
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
worst case bounds so we're going to try
 

2963
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,589
worst case bounds so we're going to try
for that

2964
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
for that
 

2965
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,750
for that
you can also do it in expected using

2966
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:15,760
you can also do it in expected using
 

2967
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,030
you can also do it in expected using
some hash tables for that

2968
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:17,040
some hash tables for that
 

2969
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,069
some hash tables for that
that dictionary right okay so

2970
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:20,079
that dictionary right okay so
 

2971
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,589
that dictionary right okay so
when you approach a data structures

2972
00:57:21,589 --> 00:57:21,599
when you approach a data structures
 

2973
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,549
when you approach a data structures
problem in this class

2974
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:24,559
problem in this class
 

2975
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,190
problem in this class
you want to tell me what it is you're

2976
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
you want to tell me what it is you're
 

2977
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,990
you want to tell me what it is you're
storing

2978
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,000
storing
 

2979
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,510
storing
first off right tell me

2980
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:31,520
first off right tell me
 

2981
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,910
first off right tell me
what's supposed to be in those things

2982
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:33,920
what's supposed to be in those things
 

2983
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,430
what's supposed to be in those things
right some invariants on this data

2984
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:35,440
right some invariants on this data
 

2985
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:35,910
right some invariants on this data
structure

2986
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:35,920

2987
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,630

to you know make sure that when i do

2988
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640
to you know make sure that when i do
 

2989
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,589
to you know make sure that when i do
queries later

2990
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:39,599
queries later
 

2991
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,589
queries later
right that these things are being

2992
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
right that these things are being
 

2993
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,349
right that these things are being

00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:46,480
uh you know if i have you know if i'm
 

2997
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,230
uh you know if i have you know if i'm
maintaining a sorted array

2998
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:48,240
maintaining a sorted array
 

2999
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,710
maintaining a sorted array
right and i'm supporting an operation to

3000
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:50,720
right and i'm supporting an operation to
 

3001
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,990
right and i'm supporting an operation to
find the maximum

3002
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:52,000
find the maximum
 

3003
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,910
find the maximum
i better anything i do to this data

3004
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:53,920
i better anything i do to this data
 

3005
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,910
i better anything i do to this data
structure better be maintaining the

3006
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:55,920
structure better be maintaining the
 

3007
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,190

00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:57,200
invariance that these things are in
 

3009
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,349
invariance that these things are in
sorted order and the last thing

3010
00:57:59,349 --> 00:57:59,359
sorted order and the last thing
 

3011
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,390
sorted order and the last thing
has the maximum item because my max

3012
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:02,400
has the maximum item because my max
 

3013
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,789

does that make sense so i want to tell

3018
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:07,839
does that make sense so i want to tell

does that make sense so i want to tell
you you want to tell me what is being

00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:10,480
stored
 

3023
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,470
stored
at you know a generic point in time

3024
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
at you know a generic point in time
 

3025
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,670
at you know a generic point in time
during your data structure

00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
during your data structure
 

3027
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,829

when i support a dynamic operation or a

3030
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,400
when i support a dynamic operation or a
 

3031
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,670
when i support a dynamic operation or a
query

3032
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:19,680
query
 

3033
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,470
query
right in a dynamic operation where i'm

3034
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:22,480
right in a dynamic operation where i'm
 

3035
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,069
right in a dynamic operation where i'm
inserting and deleting things from this

3036
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:24,079
inserting and deleting things from this
 

3037
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:24,870
inserting and deleting things from this
thing

3038
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:24,880
thing
 

3039
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,549
thing
i need to make sure that i'm maintaining

3040
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:26,559
i need to make sure that i'm maintaining
 

3041
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,390
i need to make sure that i'm maintaining
those invariants

3042
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
those invariants
 

3043
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,910
those invariants
and when i'm querying i can actually

3044
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:29,920
and when i'm querying i can actually
 

3045
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,230
and when i'm querying i can actually
rely on those invariants

3046
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:32,240
rely on those invariants
 

3047
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,470
rely on those invariants
to to answer my query does that make

3048
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,480
to to answer my query does that make
 

3049
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,670
to to answer my query does that make
sense

3050
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:35,680
sense
 

3051
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,870
sense
okay so for this problem this is

3052
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:40,880

 

3053
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,270

okay uh any ideas

3054
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:45,280
okay uh any ideas
 

3055
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,950
okay uh any ideas
i have two two kind of keys that i might

3056
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:48,960
i have two two kind of keys that i might
 

3057
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,870
i have two two kind of keys that i might
have to deal with one's a bid id and

3058
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
have to deal with one's a bid id and
 

3059
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,870
have to deal with one's a bid id and
one's a

3060
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
one's a
 

3061
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,549
one's a
a bid right so how could i

3062
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:56,559
a bid right so how could i
 

3063
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,510
a bid right so how could i
if i have two keys right that i might

3064
00:58:59,510 --> 00:58:59,520
if i have two keys right that i might
 

3065
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,230
if i have two keys right that i might
want to

3066
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:00,240
want to
 

3067
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,829
want to
maybe order on one and look up on

3068
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:01,839
maybe order on one and look up on
 

3069
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,430
maybe order on one and look up on
another

3070
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:03,440
another
 

3071
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,789
another
how many data structures do you think

3072
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:04,799
how many data structures do you think
 

3073
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,710
how many data structures do you think
i'm going to use

3074
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:06,720
i'm going to use
 

3075
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,990
i'm going to use
two that's a pretty good guess okay

3076
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:10,000
two that's a pretty good guess okay
 

3077
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,309
two that's a pretty good guess okay
so one of them let's just guess right

3078
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
so one of them let's just guess right
 

3079
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,230
so one of them let's just guess right
like i need to be able to look up on

3080
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:14,240
like i need to be able to look up on
 

3081
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,510
like i need to be able to look up on
bid right so let's

3082
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:17,520
bid right so let's
 

3083
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,270
bid right so let's
store these bitters

3084
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
store these bitters
 

3085
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,150
store these bitters
right in some kind of dictionary that's

3086
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:24,160
right in some kind of dictionary that's
 

3087
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,910
right in some kind of dictionary that's
going to be able to look up those things

3088
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
going to be able to look up those things
 

3089
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,109
going to be able to look up those things
fast right so

3090
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
fast right so
 

3091
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,109
fast right so
you know two data structures right one

3092
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:29,119
you know two data structures right one
 

3093
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,390
you know two data structures right one
is a

3094
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:30,400
is a
 

3095
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,589
is a
a dictionary on

3096
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
a dictionary on
 

3097
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,710
a dictionary on
a keyed

3098
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,720
a keyed
 

3099
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,870
a keyed
on bitter

3100
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:40,880
on bitter
 

3101
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,789
on bitter
id okay

3102
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:44,799

 

3103
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,829

what else am i going to want

3104
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:47,839
what else am i going to want
 

3105
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:52,150
what else am i going to want
what's up

3106
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160

 

3107
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,910

the other way around a dictionary stored

3108
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
the other way around a dictionary stored
 

3109
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,230
the other way around a dictionary stored
on the bids

3110
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,240
on the bids
 

3111
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,750
on the bids
is a dictionary what i want here

3112
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:01,760
is a dictionary what i want here
 

3113
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,349
is a dictionary what i want here
i want to maintain order somehow right

3114
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:03,359
i want to maintain order somehow right
 

3115
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,430
i want to maintain order somehow right
because i want to maintain the k

3116
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:05,440
because i want to maintain the k
 

3117
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,670
because i want to maintain the k
biggest things that i've seen so far

3118
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
biggest things that i've seen so far
 

3119
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,630
biggest things that i've seen so far
right now

3120
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:08,640
right now
 

3121
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,990
right now
if if i had at some point in time right

3122
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,000
if if i had at some point in time right
 

3123
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,190
if if i had at some point in time right
what's going to happen right if i'm

3124
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,200
what's going to happen right if i'm
 

3125
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,670
what's going to happen right if i'm
maintaining the k largest at any point

3126
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:15,680
maintaining the k largest at any point
 

3127
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,630
maintaining the k largest at any point
in time

3128
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
in time
 

3129
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,510
in time
it's possible that one of those bidders

3130
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:19,520
it's possible that one of those bidders
 

3131
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,950
it's possible that one of those bidders
maybe decreases his bid

3132
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:20,960
maybe decreases his bid
 

3133
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,309
maybe decreases his bid
right so it's no longer in the highest

3134
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:24,319
right so it's no longer in the highest
 

3135
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,470
right so it's no longer in the highest
i'm going to also need to keep track of

3136
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:26,480
i'm going to also need to keep track of
 

3137
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,549
i'm going to also need to keep track of
the other guys to see who i should add

3138
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:28,559
the other guys to see who i should add
 

3139
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,510
the other guys to see who i should add
back into that set

3140
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:29,520
back into that set
 

3141
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,750
back into that set
for example right so here's an idea

3142
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:33,760
for example right so here's an idea
 

3143
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,390
for example right so here's an idea
i'm going to keep not just one other

3144
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:36,400
i'm going to keep not just one other
 

3145
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,430
i'm going to keep not just one other
data structure but

3146
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:37,440
data structure but
 

3147
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,109
data structure but
two other data structures maybe this is

3148
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
two other data structures maybe this is
 

3149
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,630
two other data structures maybe this is
a leap

3150
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
a leap
 

3151
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,309
a leap
you don't have to do this there's a way

3152
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:42,319
you don't have to do this there's a way
 

3153
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,990
you don't have to do this there's a way
to do it with just one another

3154
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,000
to do it with just one another
 

3155
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,430
to do it with just one another
but i'm going to store two more one is a

3156
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
but i'm going to store two more one is a
 

3157
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,430
but i'm going to store two more one is a
kind of a data structure

3158
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,440
kind of a data structure
 

3159
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:58,630
kind of a data structure
to store

3160
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:58,640

 

3161
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:04,150

with uh store

3162
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,160

 

3163
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,829

the k highest

3164
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:08,839
the k highest
 

3165
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:12,230
the k highest
bidders

3166
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240

 

3167
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:18,150

and a data structure to store the

3168
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:18,160

 

3169
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,309

n minus k highest bidders

3170
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:22,319
n minus k highest bidders
 

3171
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,349
n minus k highest bidders
does that make sense

3172
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
does that make sense
 

3173
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,150
does that make sense
so this separates my problem quite

3174
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,160
so this separates my problem quite
 

3175
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,309
so this separates my problem quite
nicely right

3176
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
nicely right
 

3177
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,630
nicely right
if every time someone does an

3178
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
if every time someone does an
 

3179
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,829
if every time someone does an
interaction with this data structure

3180
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:36,839

 

3181
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:38,230

right

3182
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:38,240
right
 

3183
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,510
right
i can check to see whether it's bigger

3184
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
i can check to see whether it's bigger
 

3185
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,430
i can check to see whether it's bigger
than the smallest thing in here

3186
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:43,440
than the smallest thing in here
 

3187
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,150
than the smallest thing in here
right if it is i can do the same kind of

3188
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,160
right if it is i can do the same kind of
 

3189
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,230
right if it is i can do the same kind of
trick i did before right

3190
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
trick i did before right
 

3191
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,789
trick i did before right
i can remove it and stick my new one in

3192
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
i can remove it and stick my new one in
 

3193
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:51,349
i can remove it and stick my new one in
there

3194
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:51,359
there
 

3195
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,150
there
right and where do i but i removed it i

3196
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
right and where do i but i removed it i
 

3197
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,270
right and where do i but i removed it i
have to maintain this

3198
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:55,280
have to maintain this
 

3199
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,750
have to maintain this
property right so i stick it in here

3200
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760
property right so i stick it in here
 

3201
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,470
property right so i stick it in here
right

3202
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:58,480
right
 

3203
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,670
right
there's another case what's the other

3204
01:01:59,670 --> 01:01:59,680
there's another case what's the other
 

3205
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,950
there's another case what's the other
case

3206
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:02,960

 

3207
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,470

it's smaller right in which case

3208
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,480
it's smaller right in which case
 

3209
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,829
it's smaller right in which case
i don't do anything to this data

3210
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
i don't do anything to this data
 

3211
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,510
i don't do anything to this data
structure and i just stick it into here

3212
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:09,520
structure and i just stick it into here
 

3213
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,630
structure and i just stick it into here
that makes sense right so what are the

3214
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:12,640
that makes sense right so what are the
 

3215
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,789
that makes sense right so what are the
operations these data structures need to

3216
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:14,799
operations these data structures need to
 

3217
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,510
operations these data structures need to
maintain finding the minimum or the

3218
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:17,520
maintain finding the minimum or the
 

3219
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,230
maintain finding the minimum or the
maximum

3220
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
maximum
 

3221
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,470
maximum
of these two sets does that make sense

3222
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,480
of these two sets does that make sense
 

3223
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,510
of these two sets does that make sense
and actually not

3224
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520
and actually not
 

3225
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,190
and actually not
really the where are those operations i

3226
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:25,200
really the where are those operations i
 

3227
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,470
really the where are those operations i
don't have them anymore

3228
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:26,480
don't have them anymore
 

3229
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,910
don't have them anymore
but they were the priority queue

3230
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:27,920
but they were the priority queue
 

3231
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,910
but they were the priority queue
operations they had

3232
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920
operations they had
 

3233
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,589
operations they had
uh delete max right and also insert

3234
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:33,599
uh delete max right and also insert
 

3235
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,870
uh delete max right and also insert
where things that it did well on right

3236
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,880
where things that it did well on right
 

3237
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,750
where things that it did well on right
so any priority queue right anything

3238
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:39,760
so any priority queue right anything
 

3239
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,069
so any priority queue right anything
that

3240
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:40,079
that
 

3241
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,150
that
can deal with maxes and mins right

3242
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,160
can deal with maxes and mins right
 

3243
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,630
can deal with maxes and mins right
is good right and and what what's a data

3244
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:46,640
is good right and and what what's a data
 

3245
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,990
is good right and and what what's a data
structure you know that can deal with

3246
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,000
structure you know that can deal with
 

3247
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,710
structure you know that can deal with
maxes and mins pretty efficiently

3248
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:50,720
maxes and mins pretty efficiently
 

3249
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,910
maxes and mins pretty efficiently
the set avl right so

3250
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
the set avl right so
 

3251
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,750
the set avl right so
instead of data structure here i'm going

3252
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:55,760
instead of data structure here i'm going
 

3253
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,829
instead of data structure here i'm going
to say

3254
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:57,839
to say
 

3255
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:03,430
to say
set avm

3256
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:03,440
set avm
 

3257
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,109
set avm
and obviously it's going to

3258
01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:07,119
and obviously it's going to
 

3259
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,430
and obviously it's going to
be keyed by

3260
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:11,440

 

3261
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,510

bid right because that's the thing that

3262
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
bid right because that's the thing that
 

3263
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,109
bid right because that's the thing that
i'm going to want to find max's and mins

3264
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
i'm going to want to find max's and mins
 

3265
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,190
i'm going to want to find max's and mins
over

3266
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,200
over
 

3267
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,589
over
okay everyone following the logic here

3268
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:19,599
okay everyone following the logic here
 

3269
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:20,630
okay everyone following the logic here
of why i mean

3270
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640
of why i mean
 

3271
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,430
of why i mean
i'm maintaining these things so this is

3272
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:23,440
i'm maintaining these things so this is
 

3273
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,950
i'm maintaining these things so this is
this is the level of an invariance that

3274
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
this is the level of an invariance that
 

3275
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,190
this is the level of an invariance that
i want to maintain because

3276
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,200
i want to maintain because
 

3277
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,710
i want to maintain because
when i go to for example do this query

3278
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:30,720
when i go to for example do this query
 

3279
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,470
when i go to for example do this query
get revenue right i can just run through

3280
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:34,480
get revenue right i can just run through
 

3281
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,109
get revenue right i can just run through
and

3282
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
and
 

3283
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,390
and
sum all of these things oh wait how much

3284
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
sum all of these things oh wait how much
 

3285
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,549
sum all of these things oh wait how much
time do i have

3286
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
time do i have
 

3287
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,910
time do i have
do i have k time no i don't have k time

3288
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:43,920
do i have k time no i don't have k time
 

3289
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,549
do i have k time no i don't have k time
so i don't

3290
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:44,559
so i don't
 

3291
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,309
so i don't
i can't afford to sum up all of these

3292
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
i can't afford to sum up all of these
 

3293
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,430
i can't afford to sum up all of these
things at the end of my

3294
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:49,440
things at the end of my
 

3295
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,109
things at the end of my
right i have to i have to return it to

3296
01:03:51,109 --> 01:03:51,119
right i have to i have to return it to
 

3297
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,549
right i have to i have to return it to
you in constant time

3298
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:52,559
you in constant time
 

3299
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,230
you in constant time
any ideas yeah just

3300
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:56,240
any ideas yeah just
 

3301
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,190
any ideas yeah just
compute you know update a song right

3302
01:03:59,190 --> 01:03:59,200
compute you know update a song right
 

3303
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,390
compute you know update a song right
along with this

3304
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
along with this
 

3305
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,190
along with this
data structure i'm going to keep a

3306
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:03,200
data structure i'm going to keep a
 

3307
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,109
data structure i'm going to keep a
fourth thing

3308
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
fourth thing
 

3309
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,270
fourth thing
which is just total

3310
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:11,280

 

3311
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,750

of their bits right i'm going to call it

3312
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:13,760
of their bits right i'm going to call it
 

3313
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,870
of their bits right i'm going to call it
like a

3314
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:14,880
like a
 

3315
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,630
like a
t okay

3316
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:18,640
t okay
 

3317
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,230
t okay
and that's something i'm maintaining

3318
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:20,240
and that's something i'm maintaining
 

3319
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,750
and that's something i'm maintaining
it's part of my data structure

3320
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:21,760
it's part of my data structure
 

3321
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,589
it's part of my data structure
right it's you could think of it as i'm

3322
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:23,599
right it's you could think of it as i'm
 

3323
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,750
right it's you could think of it as i'm
augmenting this thing with a number

3324
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:25,760
augmenting this thing with a number
 

3325
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,549
augmenting this thing with a number
right and the point of augmenting this

3326
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
right and the point of augmenting this
 

3327
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:29,750
right and the point of augmenting this
thing with the number

3328
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
thing with the number
 

3329
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,390
thing with the number
right is that i can just if i need to

3330
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:32,400
right is that i can just if i need to
 

3331
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,069
right is that i can just if i need to
know what the total of this stuff is i

3332
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:34,079
know what the total of this stuff is i
 

3333
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,589
know what the total of this stuff is i
can just look at that number

3334
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:35,599
can just look at that number
 

3335
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,950
can just look at that number
does that make sense all right

3336
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
does that make sense all right
 

3337
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,510
does that make sense all right
so now i think you know we're almost

3338
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:41,520
so now i think you know we're almost
 

3339
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,789
so now i think you know we're almost
done we're basically done

3340
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:42,799
done we're basically done
 

3341
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,829
done we're basically done
right how do we do this uh

3342
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:45,839
right how do we do this uh
 

3343
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:50,230
right how do we do this uh
someone walk through to me how i would

3344
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:50,240
someone walk through to me how i would
 

3345
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,309
someone walk through to me how i would
get revenue with this data structure

3346
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:54,319
get revenue with this data structure
 

3347
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:56,950
get revenue with this data structure
i just i basically kind of told you look

3348
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:56,960
i just i basically kind of told you look
 

3349
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,670
i just i basically kind of told you look
at this number

3350
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:57,680
at this number
 

3351
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,670
at this number
return it right because that's the

3352
01:04:59,670 --> 01:04:59,680
return it right because that's the
 

3353
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,910
return it right because that's the
invariance that i've maintained

3354
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:01,920
invariance that i've maintained
 

3355
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,910
invariance that i've maintained
on my data structure i'm relying on this

3356
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:03,920
on my data structure i'm relying on this
 

3357
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,029
on my data structure i'm relying on this
invariant now

3358
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:05,039
invariant now
 

3359
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,950
invariant now
i better make sure this is good when i

3360
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:06,960
i better make sure this is good when i
 

3361
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,950
i better make sure this is good when i
do dynamic operations

3362
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:08,960
do dynamic operations
 

3363
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,670
do dynamic operations
right i make sure i maintain it but if i

3364
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:11,680
right i make sure i maintain it but if i
 

3365
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,109
right i make sure i maintain it but if i
by induction

3366
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:13,119
by induction
 

3367
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,109
by induction
are ensured that all of this stuff is

3368
01:05:15,109 --> 01:05:15,119
are ensured that all of this stuff is
 

3369
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,349
are ensured that all of this stuff is
good and when i do a dynamic operation

3370
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
good and when i do a dynamic operation
 

3371
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,670
good and when i do a dynamic operation
all that stuff is maintained

3372
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:19,680
all that stuff is maintained
 

3373
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,789
all that stuff is maintained
then i'm all good right so get revenue

3374
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
then i'm all good right so get revenue
 

3375
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,309
then i'm all good right so get revenue
after i kind of did all this extra work

3376
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:26,319
after i kind of did all this extra work
 

3377
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,470
after i kind of did all this extra work
right it's very easy i just look at this

3378
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:28,480
right it's very easy i just look at this
 

3379
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,150
right it's very easy i just look at this
number and return it

3380
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
number and return it
 

3381
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,789
number and return it
okay so when we're grading a data

3382
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:32,799
okay so when we're grading a data
 

3383
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,309
okay so when we're grading a data
structures problem usually we give you

3384
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319
structures problem usually we give you
 

3385
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,670
structures problem usually we give you
some points first for

3386
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:35,680
some points first for
 

3387
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,589
some points first for
setting up your data structure

3388
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:37,599
setting up your data structure
 

3389
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,190
setting up your data structure
separately from the operations and then

3390
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:39,200
separately from the operations and then
 

3391
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,470
separately from the operations and then
we give you

3392
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
we give you
 

3393
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,390
we give you
points per operation that you

3394
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:42,400
points per operation that you
 

3395
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,910
points per operation that you
successfully deal with

3396
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:43,920
successfully deal with
 

3397
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,750
successfully deal with
and then some points for correctness and

3398
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:45,760
and then some points for correctness and
 

3399
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,950
and then some points for correctness and
running time

3400
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:46,960
running time
 

3401
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,230
running time
yeah you have a question so

3402
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,240
yeah you have a question so
 

3403
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,829
yeah you have a question so
would total be like a thing that we

3404
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:51,839
would total be like a thing that we
 

3405
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,510
would total be like a thing that we
update whenever we

3406
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:53,520
update whenever we
 

3407
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,510
update whenever we
um like mess around with the highest

3408
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:55,520
um like mess around with the highest
 

3409
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,870
um like mess around with the highest
bitter tree and then

3410
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:56,880
bitter tree and then
 

3411
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,430
bitter tree and then
and minus k highest bigger tree sorry

3412
01:05:59,430 --> 01:05:59,440
and minus k highest bigger tree sorry
 

3413
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,230
and minus k highest bigger tree sorry
say that again

3414
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,240
say that again
 

3415
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,630
say that again
so like are we treating like the total

3416
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:02,640
so like are we treating like the total
 

3417
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,150
so like are we treating like the total
like of like an augmentation that we

3418
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:04,160
like of like an augmentation that we
 

3419
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,589
like of like an augmentation that we
update every time we do something yeah

3420
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:05,599
update every time we do something yeah
 

3421
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:06,069
update every time we do something yeah
yeah

3422
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:06,079
yeah
 

3423
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,230
yeah
so it's just a one number it's not

3424
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,240
so it's just a one number it's not
 

3425
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,670
so it's just a one number it's not
really a data structure it's just one

3426
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:09,680
really a data structure it's just one
 

3427
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,309
really a data structure it's just one
number

3428
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
number
 

3429
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,710
number
that i'm storing with my my database

3430
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
that i'm storing with my my database
 

3431
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,470
that i'm storing with my my database
right

3432
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:14,480
right
 

3433
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,390
right
okay all right so how do i implement

3434
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
okay all right so how do i implement
 

3435
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,029
okay all right so how do i implement
a uh new bid operation

3436
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:23,039

 

3437
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,990

yeah can we assume that the bids will

3438
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:26,000
yeah can we assume that the bids will
 

3439
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,190
yeah can we assume that the bids will
also be unique

3440
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,200
also be unique
 

3441
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,870
also be unique
can you assume that the bids may be

3442
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
can you assume that the bids may be
 

3443
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,950
can you assume that the bids may be
unique no

3444
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
unique no
 

3445
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,109
unique no
right so that's actually something that

3446
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
right so that's actually something that
 

3447
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,950
right so that's actually something that
is a really useful observation

3448
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:38,960
is a really useful observation
 

3449
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,870
is a really useful observation
we've been talking about set data

3450
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:40,880
we've been talking about set data
 

3451
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,230
we've been talking about set data
structures

3452
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,240
structures
 

3453
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,270
structures
as requiring unique keys right

3454
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:47,280
as requiring unique keys right
 

3455
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,870
as requiring unique keys right
how can i deal with non-unique keys it

3456
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:48,880
how can i deal with non-unique keys it
 

3457
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,710
how can i deal with non-unique keys it
actually turns out that you know hash

3458
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:50,720
actually turns out that you know hash
 

3459
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,309
actually turns out that you know hash
table it's really important that these

3460
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:52,319
table it's really important that these
 

3461
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:52,630
table it's really important that these
be

3462
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:52,640
be
 

3463
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,829
be
unique keys right because i i need to

3464
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:55,839
unique keys right because i i need to
 

3465
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,430
unique keys right because i i need to
check whether it's in there i'm looking

3466
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:57,440
check whether it's in there i'm looking
 

3467
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:57,990
check whether it's in there i'm looking
for that

3468
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
for that
 

3469
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,470
for that
single key and when i find it i have to

3470
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:00,480
single key and when i find it i have to
 

3471
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,150
single key and when i find it i have to
return right if i had multiple things

3472
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,160
return right if i had multiple things
 

3473
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,109
return right if i had multiple things
with that key

3474
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
with that key
 

3475
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,390
with that key
i might not return the one that i'm

3476
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,400
i might not return the one that i'm
 

3477
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,990
i might not return the one that i'm
looking for right it doesn't even make

3478
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,000
looking for right it doesn't even make
 

3479
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,549
looking for right it doesn't even make
sense

3480
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:06,559
sense
 

3481
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,789
sense
right but you can generalize the

3482
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
right but you can generalize the
 

3483
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,069
right but you can generalize the
set uh

3484
01:07:14,069 --> 01:07:14,079
set uh
 

3485
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,190
set uh
uh kind of infrastructure right

3486
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:17,200
uh kind of infrastructure right
 

3487
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,750
uh kind of infrastructure right
to deal with multi-sets how can i how

3488
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:19,760
to deal with multi-sets how can i how
 

3489
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,190
to deal with multi-sets how can i how
can i do that

3490
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:21,200
can i do that
 

3491
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,710
can i do that
well with each key right

3492
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:24,720
well with each key right
 

3493
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,029
well with each key right
again i'm storing unique keys with each

3494
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:27,039
again i'm storing unique keys with each
 

3495
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,190
again i'm storing unique keys with each
key i can link it to a sequence data

3496
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:29,200
key i can link it to a sequence data
 

3497
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:29,990
key i can link it to a sequence data
structure

3498
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000
structure
 

3499
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,710
structure
or any other data structure right and

3500
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:32,720
or any other data structure right and
 

3501
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,990
or any other data structure right and
what i'm do is i'm going to

3502
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
what i'm do is i'm going to
 

3503
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,990
what i'm do is i'm going to
anything that has that key i'm going to

3504
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,000
anything that has that key i'm going to
 

3505
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,990
anything that has that key i'm going to
stick it in that data structure

3506
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:38,000
stick it in that data structure
 

3507
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,589
stick it in that data structure
right so instead of storing one item

3508
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:39,599
right so instead of storing one item
 

3509
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,109
right so instead of storing one item
there i have the possibility of storing

3510
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:41,119
there i have the possibility of storing
 

3511
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:41,990
there i have the possibility of storing
many things there

3512
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,000
many things there
 

3513
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,069
many things there
now i have to change the semantics here

3514
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:44,079
now i have to change the semantics here
 

3515
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,109
now i have to change the semantics here
right if i'm saying find on this key

3516
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
right if i'm saying find on this key
 

3517
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,670
right if i'm saying find on this key
well now i could say i'm going to return

3518
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:49,680
well now i could say i'm going to return
 

3519
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,589
well now i could say i'm going to return
all of the things with that key

3520
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:51,599
all of the things with that key
 

3521
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,750
all of the things with that key
or i'm going to show our some thing with

3522
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:53,760
or i'm going to show our some thing with
 

3523
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,630
or i'm going to show our some thing with
that key

3524
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
that key
 

3525
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,390
that key
right but you get the idea all i have to

3526
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:56,400
right but you get the idea all i have to
 

3527
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,789
right but you get the idea all i have to
do is map it to

3528
01:07:58,789 --> 01:07:58,799
do is map it to
 

3529
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:00,549
do is map it to
some other data structure to maintain

3530
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
some other data structure to maintain
 

3531
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:01,990
some other data structure to maintain
those things like maybe

3532
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,000
those things like maybe
 

3533
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,230
those things like maybe
i want all the things with that key

3534
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:06,240

 

3535
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,750

i want to find the one with this other

3536
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:07,760
i want to find the one with this other
 

3537
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,270
i want to find the one with this other
key right

3538
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280
key right
 

3539
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,270
key right
so maybe i link to a set data structure

3540
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:11,280
so maybe i link to a set data structure
 

3541
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,870
so maybe i link to a set data structure
that can search on other things right

3542
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:12,880
that can search on other things right
 

3543
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,430
that can search on other things right
but the idea here is we maintain this

3544
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:15,440
but the idea here is we maintain this
 

3545
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,430
but the idea here is we maintain this
uniqueness key property

3546
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:17,440
uniqueness key property
 

3547
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,749
uniqueness key property
right i have to relax my semantics so

3548
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:19,759
right i have to relax my semantics so
 

3549
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,349
right i have to relax my semantics so
that i'm storing

3550
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
that i'm storing
 

3551
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,269
that i'm storing
multiple things at that key location

3552
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:23,279
multiple things at that key location
 

3553
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,630
multiple things at that key location
does that make sense

3554
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:24,640
does that make sense
 

3555
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,309
does that make sense
yeah why does it matter whether you've

3556
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:26,319
yeah why does it matter whether you've
 

3557
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,070
yeah why does it matter whether you've
said the entree

3558
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,080
said the entree
 

3559
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,110
said the entree
or not uh it does uh so

3560
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
or not uh it does uh so
 

3561
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,229
or not uh it does uh so
it's going to matter here right because

3562
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:34,239
it's going to matter here right because
 

3563
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:35,349
it's going to matter here right because
i have bids

3564
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:35,359
i have bids
 

3565
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,510
i have bids
right and the bids could be non-unique

3566
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:37,520
right and the bids could be non-unique
 

3567
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,789
right and the bids could be non-unique
right

3568
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:38,799
right
 

3569
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,910
right
two people could have the same you know

3570
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:41,920
two people could have the same you know
 

3571
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,590
two people could have the same you know
uh bid and by our definition of a set

3572
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:45,600
uh bid and by our definition of a set
 

3573
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,590
uh bid and by our definition of a set
data structure it had to have unique

3574
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:47,600
data structure it had to have unique
 

3575
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,590
data structure it had to have unique
keys so if i stuck in all these things

3576
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:49,600
keys so if i stuck in all these things
 

3577
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,349
keys so if i stuck in all these things
keyed by bidder you got a problem right

3578
01:08:53,349 --> 01:08:53,359
keyed by bidder you got a problem right
 

3579
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,950
keyed by bidder you got a problem right
now in actuality we can get away with

3580
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:54,960
now in actuality we can get away with
 

3581
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,030
now in actuality we can get away with
that by storing basically a

3582
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,040
that by storing basically a
 

3583
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,709
that by storing basically a
linked list of all the things with that

3584
01:08:58,709 --> 01:08:58,719
linked list of all the things with that
 

3585
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,349
linked list of all the things with that
key and we'd be fine

3586
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:01,359
key and we'd be fine
 

3587
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,789
key and we'd be fine
right and then whenever i want to

3588
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
right and then whenever i want to
 

3589
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,870
right and then whenever i want to
return one i could just do but actually

3590
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:06,880
return one i could just do but actually
 

3591
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,950
return one i could just do but actually
a binary tree

3592
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:08,960
a binary tree
 

3593
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,510
a binary tree
right actually is flexible enough that

3594
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
right actually is flexible enough that
 

3595
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,070
right actually is flexible enough that
in most implementations you can just

3596
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,080
in most implementations you can just
 

3597
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,070
in most implementations you can just
store a bunch of those things but

3598
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,080
store a bunch of those things but
 

3599
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,309
store a bunch of those things but
actually our run times

3600
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:18,319
actually our run times
 

3601
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,669
actually our run times
do worse then right what does it mean to

3602
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:21,679
do worse then right what does it mean to
 

3603
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,910
do worse then right what does it mean to
find next in my sequence

3604
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:23,920
find next in my sequence
 

3605
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,669
find next in my sequence
right what does it mean to find the

3606
01:09:27,669 --> 01:09:27,679
right what does it mean to find the
 

3607
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,709
right what does it mean to find the
to return the next larger thing above

3608
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
to return the next larger thing above
 

3609
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:31,910
to return the next larger thing above
this key

3610
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:31,920
this key
 

3611
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,669
this key
doesn't really make sense because there

3612
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:33,679
doesn't really make sense because there
 

3613
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,189
doesn't really make sense because there
could be multiple ones which one do i

3614
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:35,199
could be multiple ones which one do i
 

3615
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:36,070
could be multiple ones which one do i
return

3616
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:36,080
return
 

3617
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,390
return
and if i repeatedly do find next on this

3618
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,400
and if i repeatedly do find next on this
 

3619
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,990
and if i repeatedly do find next on this
data structure

3620
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:40,000
data structure
 

3621
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,189
data structure
right i might not loop through all the

3622
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:43,199
right i might not loop through all the
 

3623
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:43,910
right i might not loop through all the
things

3624
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:43,920
things
 

3625
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,189
things
right so some stuff breaks down

3626
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:47,199
right so some stuff breaks down
 

3627
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:50,229
right so some stuff breaks down
in our interface right so i would

3628
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:50,239
in our interface right so i would
 

3629
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:53,269
in our interface right so i would
prefer you use unique keys in this this

3630
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:53,279
prefer you use unique keys in this this
 

3631
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,870
prefer you use unique keys in this this
kind of situation

3632
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:54,880
kind of situation
 

3633
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,990
kind of situation
next tuesday i think with binary heaps

3634
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:58,000
next tuesday i think with binary heaps
 

3635
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,189
next tuesday i think with binary heaps
uh we'll deal with

3636
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
uh we'll deal with
 

3637
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:06,070
uh we'll deal with
non-unique keys that's fine but

3638
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:06,080
non-unique keys that's fine but
 

3639
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,790
non-unique keys that's fine but
if you're gonna use non-unique keys in

3640
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:08,800
if you're gonna use non-unique keys in
 

3641
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,270
if you're gonna use non-unique keys in
here

3642
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,280
here
 

3643
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,750
here
you just gotta be a little bit careful

3644
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:11,760
you just gotta be a little bit careful
 

3645
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,030
you just gotta be a little bit careful
about the semantics

3646
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040
about the semantics
 

3647
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:23,350
about the semantics
okay yep

3648
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:23,360

 

3649
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,189

uh so you get the same uh

3650
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:27,199
uh so you get the same uh
 

3651
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,110
uh so you get the same uh
running time you the you have to change

3652
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:29,120
running time you the you have to change
 

3653
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,790
running time you the you have to change
the semantics on what you mean by find

3654
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
the semantics on what you mean by find
 

3655
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,270
the semantics on what you mean by find
something

3656
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
something
 

3657
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,990
something
right i just want to return anything

3658
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,000
right i just want to return anything
 

3659
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,430
right i just want to return anything
with this key

3660
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:35,440
with this key
 

3661
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,110
with this key
right what if everything has the same

3662
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
right what if everything has the same
 

3663
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,750
right what if everything has the same
key then it takes constant time

3664
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:39,760
key then it takes constant time
 

3665
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,990
key then it takes constant time
i just returned the first thing

3666
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,000
i just returned the first thing
 

3667
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,110
i just returned the first thing
it's i mean these are special cases that

3668
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:47,120
it's i mean these are special cases that
 

3669
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,630
it's i mean these are special cases that
you know you have to think about right

3670
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:50,640
you know you have to think about right
 

3671
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,390
you know you have to think about right
uh i don't like thinking about them

3672
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
uh i don't like thinking about them
 

3673
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,830
uh i don't like thinking about them
right so i just like

3674
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:53,840
right so i just like
 

3675
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,470
right so i just like
having unique keys and if i want a

3676
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:56,480
having unique keys and if i want a
 

3677
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,430
having unique keys and if i want a
situation where i have non-unique keys

3678
01:10:59,430 --> 01:10:59,440
situation where i have non-unique keys
 

3679
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,750
situation where i have non-unique keys
i'm going to basically put collisions at

3680
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:01,760
i'm going to basically put collisions at
 

3681
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,790
i'm going to basically put collisions at
that key

3682
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:02,800
that key
 

3683
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,870
that key
into a new data structure right it's

3684
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:04,880
into a new data structure right it's
 

3685
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,630
into a new data structure right it's
just easier for me to separate out my

3686
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:06,640
just easier for me to separate out my
 

3687
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:06,950
just easier for me to separate out my
head

3688
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:06,960

you know when you're dealing with a

3698
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:15,600
you know when you're dealing with a
 

3699
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,510
you know when you're dealing with a
multi-set it's a little bit more

3700
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:17,520
multi-set it's a little bit more
 

3701
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,070
multi-set it's a little bit more
problematic

what am i going to need for my update
 

3717
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,030
what am i going to need for my update
i'm going to be able to

01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,040
i'm going to be able to
 

3719
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,390
i'm going to be able to
need to essentially find in each of

3720
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:42,400
need to essentially find in each of
 

3721
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,070
need to essentially find in each of
these data structures

3722
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,080
these data structures
 

3723
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,430
these data structures
where that bidder is right

3724
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
where that bidder is right
 

3725
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,830
where that bidder is right
and if i just have a thing keyed on

3726
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:49,840
and if i just have a thing keyed on
 

3727
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,110
and if i just have a thing keyed on
their bid

3728
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:51,120
their bid
 

3729
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,110
their bid
right the interface doesn't tell me what

3730
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,120
right the interface doesn't tell me what
 

3731
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,630
right the interface doesn't tell me what
their old bid was

3732
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
their old bid was
 

3733
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,390
their old bid was
it just tells me what their bidder id is

3734
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:56,400
it just tells me what their bidder id is
 

3735
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,510
it just tells me what their bidder id is
right so if i just had their bidder id

3736
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,520
right so if i just had their bidder id
 

3737
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,149
right so if i just had their bidder id
and their new bid how the heck am i

3738
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:02,159
and their new bid how the heck am i
 

3739
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:02,950
and their new bid how the heck am i
going to find out

3740
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:02,960
going to find out
 

3741
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,550
going to find out
which of these dash or where in these

3742
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:04,560
which of these dash or where in these
 

3743
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,229
which of these dash or where in these
data structures they are

3744
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
data structures they are
 

3745
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,669
data structures they are
right what i can do is i can store

3746
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:09,679
right what i can do is i can store
 

3747
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,790
right what i can do is i can store
in this dictionary which i can look up

3748
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:12,800
in this dictionary which i can look up
 

3749
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,149
in this dictionary which i can look up
in some amount of time right a pointer

3750
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:16,159
in some amount of time right a pointer
 

3751
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,149
in some amount of time right a pointer
to where it exists in these things

3752
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
to where it exists in these things
 

3753
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,030
to where it exists in these things
does that make sense this is called

3754
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
does that make sense this is called
 

3755
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,030
does that make sense this is called
cross linking you may have

3756
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,040
cross linking you may have
 

3757
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,110
cross linking you may have
done that a little bit in problem set

3758
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,120
done that a little bit in problem set
 

3759
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,790
done that a little bit in problem set
two or something like that

3760
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:26,800
two or something like that
 

3761
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,550
two or something like that
yeah are we storing a pointer to a

3762
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:28,560
yeah are we storing a pointer to a
 

3763
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,470
yeah are we storing a pointer to a
specific figure

3764
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
specific figure
 

3765
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,189
specific figure
yeah exactly right so the the invariant

3766
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:33,199
yeah exactly right so the the invariant
 

3767
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,790
yeah exactly right so the the invariant
we have is that all of the bidders we've

3768
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:34,800
we have is that all of the bidders we've
 

3769
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,550
we have is that all of the bidders we've
processed so far exist in these data

3770
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,560
processed so far exist in these data
 

3771
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,350
processed so far exist in these data

right in one of these data structures

3774
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,400
right in one of these data structures
 

3775
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,950
right in one of these data structures
and because we've used a set avl tree

3776
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:42,960
and because we've used a set avl tree
 

3777
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:43,750
and because we've used a set avl tree
right

3778
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:43,760
right
 

3779
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,669
right
in particular exists in a node of one of

3780
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:45,679
in particular exists in a node of one of

these data structures
 

3783
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,630
these data structures
right what we can do is in this thing

3784
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:50,640
right what we can do is in this thing
 

3785
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,990
right what we can do is in this thing
maintain pointers right

3786
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,000
maintain pointers right
 

3787
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,709
maintain pointers right
mapping each of the bitter ids to their

3788
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:56,719
mapping each of the bitter ids to their
 

3789
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,870
mapping each of the bitter ids to their
location in these data structures

01:12:58,870 --> 01:12:58,880
location in these data structures
 

3791
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,470
location in these data structures
and why is that going to be a useful

3792
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
and why is that going to be a useful
 

3793
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,990
and why is that going to be a useful
thing

3794
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,000
thing
 

3795
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,750
thing
right uh say i mapped this dictionary

3796
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:05,760
right uh say i mapped this dictionary
 

3797
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,229
right uh say i mapped this dictionary
right

3798
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:06,239
right
 

3799
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:07,750
right
what could i use for this dictionary to

3800
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:07,760
what could i use for this dictionary to
 

3801
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,470
what could i use for this dictionary to
get the running time we're looking for

3802
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:10,480
get the running time we're looking for
 

3803
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,950
get the running time we're looking for
i could use a hash table or a set avl

3804
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:12,960
i could use a hash table or a set avl
 

3805
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,390
i could use a hash table or a set avl
right if it's set avl

3806
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:14,400
right if it's set avl
 

3807
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,390
right if it's set avl
i'm going to get logarithmic time worst

3808
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:16,400
i'm going to get logarithmic time worst
 

3809
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,669
i'm going to get logarithmic time worst
case

3810
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
case
 

3811
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:18,709
case
with a hash table i'm going to get

3812
01:13:18,709 --> 01:13:18,719
with a hash table i'm going to get
 

3813
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,030
with a hash table i'm going to get
constant time but it's expected right so

3814
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,040
constant time but it's expected right so
 

3815
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,550
constant time but it's expected right so
it could be linear time in the worst

3816
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:22,560
it could be linear time in the worst
 

3817
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,510
it could be linear time in the worst
case

3818
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:23,520
case
 

3819
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,750
case
right so we're going to use a set avl

3820
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:25,760
right so we're going to use a set avl
 

3821
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,510
right so we're going to use a set avl
tree right because that's what we do

3822
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520
tree right because that's what we do
 

3823
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,030
tree right because that's what we do
right now and that's going to give us

3824
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:31,040
right now and that's going to give us
 

3825
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,229
right now and that's going to give us
worst case

3826
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:32,239
worst case
 

3827
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,310
worst case
okay so what i'm going to do is for each

3828
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,320
okay so what i'm going to do is for each
 

3829
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,350
okay so what i'm going to do is for each
one of these things i'm going to store

3830
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
one of these things i'm going to store
 

3831
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,709
one of these things i'm going to store
that pointer so what i'm going to do

3832
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:36,719
that pointer so what i'm going to do
 

3833
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,550
that pointer so what i'm going to do
is first i'm going to do that operation

3834
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:40,560
is first i'm going to do that operation
 

3835
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,030
is first i'm going to do that operation
we had

3836
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,040
we had
 

3837
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,910
we had
if i'm adding a new bitter right i'm

3838
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:43,920
if i'm adding a new bitter right i'm
 

3839
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,669
if i'm adding a new bitter right i'm
going to take

3840
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:45,679
going to take
 

3841
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:48,950
going to take
the you know the d and b right

3842
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:48,960
the you know the d and b right
 

3843
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,229
the you know the d and b right
these two values that object that's

3844
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:52,239
these two values that object that's
 

3845
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,950
these two values that object that's
that that bitter object or whatever i'm

3846
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
that that bitter object or whatever i'm
 

3847
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,630
that that bitter object or whatever i'm
going to look at the smallest thing in

3848
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:56,640
going to look at the smallest thing in
 

3849
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,590
going to look at the smallest thing in
this

3850
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:57,600
this
 

3851
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,590
this
data structure right see if it's bid

3852
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:01,600
data structure right see if it's bid
 

3853
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,950
data structure right see if it's bid
is bigger than my

3854
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:04,960
is bigger than my
 

3855
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,910
is bigger than my
my the the thing i'm inserting right if

3856
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:07,920
my the the thing i'm inserting right if
 

3857
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,430
my the the thing i'm inserting right if
it is then i'm not going to touch this

3858
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:09,440
it is then i'm not going to touch this
 

3859
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,709
it is then i'm not going to touch this
data structure i'm just going to insert

3860
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:10,719
data structure i'm just going to insert
 

3861
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:11,750
data structure i'm just going to insert
it in here

3862
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:11,760
it in here
 

3863
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,310
it in here
and now after i insert it in here i know

3864
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
and now after i insert it in here i know
 

3865
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,510
and now after i insert it in here i know
exactly where it is in the data

3866
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:15,520
exactly where it is in the data
 

3867
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,950
exactly where it is in the data
structure i just inserted it

3868
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:16,960
structure i just inserted it
 

3869
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,550
structure i just inserted it
right right so now

3870
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:20,560
right right so now
 

3871
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,229
right right so now
holding that in my hand the node right

3872
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
holding that in my hand the node right
 

3873
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,229
holding that in my hand the node right
i can go and insert that bitter into

3874
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:26,239
i can go and insert that bitter into
 

3875
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:27,510
i can go and insert that bitter into
here right

3876
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:27,520
here right
 

3877
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,470
here right
by bit id right so it's going to take

3878
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:30,480
by bit id right so it's going to take
 

3879
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,750
by bit id right so it's going to take
logarithmic time

3880
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:31,760
logarithmic time
 

3881
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,950
logarithmic time
and now i can store with that node

3882
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:34,960
and now i can store with that node
 

3883
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,750
and now i can store with that node
my pointer to this data structure does

3884
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:37,760
my pointer to this data structure does
 

3885
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,550
my pointer to this data structure does
that make sense

3886
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:38,560
that make sense
 

3887
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,709
that make sense
and in the other case i kind of do the

3888
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:40,719
and in the other case i kind of do the
 

3889
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:41,669
and in the other case i kind of do the
same thing right

3890
01:14:41,669 --> 01:14:41,679
same thing right
 

3891
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:43,510
same thing right
if it's bigger than the smallest thing

3892
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,520
if it's bigger than the smallest thing
 

3893
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,590
if it's bigger than the smallest thing
here i pop that smaller thing out stick

3894
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600
here i pop that smaller thing out stick
 

3895
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,229
here i pop that smaller thing out stick
it in there

3896
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:46,239
it in there
 

3897
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,550
it in there
and i stick my new guy in here

3898
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:48,560
and i stick my new guy in here
 

3899
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,510
and i stick my new guy in here
cross-linking

3900
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:49,520
cross-linking
 

3901
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,550
cross-linking
each of those pointers along the way

3902
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:52,560
each of those pointers along the way
 

3903
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,430
each of those pointers along the way
does that make sense hopefully

3904
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,440
does that make sense hopefully
 

3905
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,790
does that make sense hopefully
kind of kind of okay yeah

3906
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:00,800
kind of kind of okay yeah
 

3907
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,510
kind of kind of okay yeah
and for update very similar right if i

3908

i just remove it from the tree right or
i remove it from the tree and then i

01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,950
i remove it from the tree and then i
reinsert

i'm always removing some constant number
 

3951
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,630
i'm always removing some constant number
of nodes in each of these trees and and

01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
of nodes in each of these trees and and
 

3953
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,149
of nodes in each of these trees and and
adding back in a constant number of

01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:54,159
adding back in a constant number of
 

3955
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,390
adding back in a constant number of
things and while i do that i just make

3956
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
things and while i do that i just make
 

3957
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,390
things and while i do that i just make
sure to update this total as i go

3958
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
sure to update this total as i go
 

3959
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,990
sure to update this total as i go
right his total was the sum of all of

3960
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
right his total was the sum of all of
 

3961
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,630
right his total was the sum of all of
the

3962
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
the
 

3963
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,470
the
bids in here and if i insert a new bid

3964
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,480
bids in here and if i insert a new bid
 

3965
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,189
bids in here and if i insert a new bid
in here

3966
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
in here
 

3967
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,669
in here
i have to add to that total and if i

3968
01:16:09,669 --> 01:16:09,679
i have to add to that total and if i
 

3969
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:11,510
i have to add to that total and if i
remove one i have to remove from that

3970
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:11,520
remove one i have to remove from that
 

3971
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,070
remove one i have to remove from that
total but

3972
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:12,080
total but
 

3973
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,510
total but
again it's a constant number of things

3974
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
again it's a constant number of things
 

3975
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,030
again it's a constant number of things
i'm moving in and out of these data

3976
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:15,040
i'm moving in and out of these data
 

3977
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:15,750
i'm moving in and out of these data
structures

3978
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:15,760
structures
 

3979
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,270
structures
and so it can update this in constant

3980
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,280
and so it can update this in constant
 

3981
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,669
and so it can update this in constant
time that makes sense

3982
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:19,679
time that makes sense
 

3983
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:23,110
time that makes sense
now the look up here and the insertion

3984
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:23,120
now the look up here and the insertion
 

3985
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,390
now the look up here and the insertion

those each took logarithmic time

3988
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679
those each took logarithmic time
 

3989
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:30,229
those each took logarithmic time
worst case but i did a constant number

3990
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:30,239
worst case but i did a constant number
 

3991
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:31,110
worst case but i did a constant number
of them so

3992
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,120
of them so
 

3993
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,189
of them so
again longer than time does that make

3994
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
again longer than time does that make
 

3995
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,310
again longer than time does that make
sense that's

3996
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
sense that's
 

3997
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,189
sense that's
that's essentially this problem it's a

3998
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
that's essentially this problem it's a
 

3999
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:37,590
that's essentially this problem it's a
little

4000
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:37,600
little
 

4001
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,669
little
it's difficult right there's a lot of

4002
01:16:39,669 --> 01:16:39,679
it's difficult right there's a lot of
 

4003
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:40,790
it's difficult right there's a lot of
moving parts here

4004
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800
moving parts here
 

4005
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,110
moving parts here
right but if you just break it up into

4006
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,120
right but if you just break it up into
 

4007
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,470
right but if you just break it up into
describe to me and

4008
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:44,480
describe to me and
 

4009
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,550
describe to me and
like you really do a good job on this

4010
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,560
like you really do a good job on this
 

4011
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,070
like you really do a good job on this
part describe well

4012
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,080
part describe well
 

4013
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,630
part describe well
to me what your data structure has then

4014
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
to me what your data structure has then
 

4015
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,229
to me what your data structure has then
those descriptions of those algorithms

4016
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239
those descriptions of those algorithms
 

4017
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:52,709
those descriptions of those algorithms
can be

4018
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:52,719
can be
 

4019
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,310
can be
pretty brief actually right so

4020
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
pretty brief actually right so
 

4021
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,030
pretty brief actually right so
you know in this one you tell me these

4022
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
you know in this one you tell me these
 

4023
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,550
you know in this one you tell me these
three data structures you tell me this

4024
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,560
three data structures you tell me this
 

4025
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,830
three data structures you tell me this
guy's mapping to its location and these

4026
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:03,840
guy's mapping to its location and these
 

4027
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,709
guy's mapping to its location and these
things

4028
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
things
 

4029
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,229
things
i'm maintaining this guy right and then

4030
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
i'm maintaining this guy right and then
 

4031
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,310
i'm maintaining this guy right and then
you just maintain those things with

4032
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:10,320
you just maintain those things with
 

4033
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,149
you just maintain those things with
dynamic operations and then use

4034
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
dynamic operations and then use
 

4035
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,189
dynamic operations and then use
those things for query operations that

4036
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:15,199
those things for query operations that
 

4037
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,470
those things for query operations that
make sense

4038
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,480
make sense
 

4039
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,510
make sense
okay

4040
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:19,520

 

4041
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:25,750

wow we have 10 more minutes

4042
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:25,760

 

4043
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,830

i'm going to briefly do four or four

4044
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:28,840
i'm going to briefly do four or four
 

4045
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,990
i'm going to briefly do four or four
okay

4046
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,000
okay
 

4047
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,070
okay
for you okay receiver roster we've got a

01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,870

she's got a bunch of football players

4052
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880
she's got a bunch of football players
 

4053
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,590
she's got a bunch of football players
receivers

4054
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:41,600

 

4055
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,870

and wanting to start on our team

4056
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
and wanting to start on our team
 

4057
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,910
and wanting to start on our team
the uh some number of of players that

4058
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:47,920
the uh some number of of players that
 

4059
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,790
the uh some number of of players that
have the best

4060
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:48,800
have the best
 

4061
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,550
have the best
the highest performance okay and by

4062
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:50,560
the highest performance okay and by
 

4063
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,830
the highest performance okay and by
performance we mean

4064
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:51,840
performance we mean
 

4065
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,510
performance we mean
the average number of points they've

4066
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:53,520
the average number of points they've
 

4067
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,350
the average number of points they've
played in games that they have logged in

4068
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:55,360
played in games that they have logged in
 

4069
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,070
played in games that they have logged in
their system

4070
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,080
their system
 

4071
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,310
their system
right but actually their data is

4072
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:58,320
right but actually their data is
 

4073
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,830
right but actually their data is
incomplete

4074
01:17:59,830 --> 01:17:59,840
incomplete
 

4075
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,590
incomplete
right they don't know which games and

4076
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:01,600
right they don't know which games and
 

4077
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,189
right they don't know which games and
how much they scored in all these things

4078
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:03,199
how much they scored in all these things
 

4079
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,709
how much they scored in all these things
there could be errors

4080
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:04,719
there could be errors
 

4081
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,430
there could be errors
right and so these interns they're up

4082
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,440
right and so these interns they're up
 

4083
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,790
right and so these interns they're up
they're constantly updating this

4084
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
they're constantly updating this
 

4085
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,030
they're constantly updating this
database with queries like

4086
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,040
database with queries like
 

4087
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,070
database with queries like
uh oh uh

4088
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
uh oh uh
 

4089
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,990
uh oh uh
you know never mind this person didn't

4090
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000
you know never mind this person didn't
 

4091
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,910
you know never mind this person didn't
play in this game

4092
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:17,920
play in this game
 

4093
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,470
play in this game
or actually they did and they scored

4094
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:20,480
or actually they did and they scored
 

4095
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,430
or actually they did and they scored
this number of points

4096
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:21,440
this number of points
 

4097
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,870
this number of points
right that's the clear and record things

4098
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:24,880
right that's the clear and record things
 

4099
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,669
right that's the clear and record things
right and then at some point in time

4100
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:27,679
right and then at some point in time
 

4101
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,030
right and then at some point in time
right like when we start

4102
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
right like when we start
 

4103
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,669
right like when we start
when we want to play a game right i want

4104
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:31,679
when we want to play a game right i want
 

4105
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,990
when we want to play a game right i want
to be able to return

4106
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,000
to be able to return
 

4107
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,630
to be able to return
the the jersey with the k-th highest

4108
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
the the jersey with the k-th highest
 

4109
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,030
the the jersey with the k-th highest
performance and log in time

4110
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
performance and log in time
 

4111
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,790
performance and log in time
okay this is kind of a

4112
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:42,800
okay this is kind of a
 

4113
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,750
okay this is kind of a
kind of a rank query right right the kth

4114
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
kind of a rank query right right the kth
 

4115
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,110
kind of a rank query right right the kth
highest

4116
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,120
highest
 

4117
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,910
highest
okay uh now in actuality i might want to

4118
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920
okay uh now in actuality i might want to
 

4119
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,470
okay uh now in actuality i might want to
return

4120
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
return
 

4121
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,070
return
all k highest players so that that might

4122
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:54,080
all k highest players so that that might
 

4123
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,550
all k highest players so that that might
be my

4124
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:54,560
be my
 

4125
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,350
be my
my roster right but this is you know a

4126
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,360
my roster right but this is you know a
 

4127
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,910
my roster right but this is you know a
more generalized query

4128
01:18:59,910 --> 01:18:59,920
more generalized query
 

4129
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,950
more generalized query
it's more specific more it's it's

4130
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:02,960
it's more specific more it's it's
 

4131
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,950
it's more specific more it's it's
not really comparable but you get an

4132
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:04,960
not really comparable but you get an
 

4133
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,790
not really comparable but you get an
idea for why that might be useful to the

4134
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:06,800
idea for why that might be useful to the
 

4135
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,510
idea for why that might be useful to the
coach

4136
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
coach
 

4137
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,310
coach
i don't know maybe not okay so what's

4138
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
i don't know maybe not okay so what's
 

4139
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,910
i don't know maybe not okay so what's
the idea here

4140
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:11,920
the idea here
 

4141
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,110
the idea here
we have a lot of different things

4142
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:13,120
we have a lot of different things
 

4143
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,110
we have a lot of different things
floating around we got games

4144
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,120
floating around we got games
 

4145
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,189
floating around we got games
they have ids unique ids we got

4146
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
they have ids unique ids we got
 

4147
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,510
they have ids unique ids we got
receivers they have unique ids

4148
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,520
receivers they have unique ids
 

4149
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,750
receivers they have unique ids
and each receiver could play in many

4150
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
and each receiver could play in many
 

4151
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,430
and each receiver could play in many
games

4152
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
games
 

4153
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,550
games
right oh that's kind of worrisome

4154
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:26,560
right oh that's kind of worrisome
 

4155
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,030
right oh that's kind of worrisome
and many receivers could play in the

4156
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,040
and many receivers could play in the
 

4157
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,790
and many receivers could play in the
same game

4158
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
same game
 

4159
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,950
same game
these kind of many-to-one mappings are a

4160
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
these kind of many-to-one mappings are a
 

4161
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,310
these kind of many-to-one mappings are a
little confusing

4162
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:34,320
little confusing
 

4163
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,950
little confusing
and then we've got each player

4164
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:38,960

 

4165
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,790

receiver having a certain number of

4166
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
receiver having a certain number of
 

4167
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,070
receiver having a certain number of
points per game

4168
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:42,080
points per game
 

4169
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,950
points per game
and we're trying to sort them kind of by

4170
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:44,960
and we're trying to sort them kind of by
 

4171
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,550
and we're trying to sort them kind of by
their performance which is a rational

4172
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:46,560
their performance which is a rational
 

4173
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,830
their performance which is a rational
number

4174
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:48,840
number
 

4175
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,590
number
right which has to do with the number of

4176
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:51,600
right which has to do with the number of
 

4177
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,790
right which has to do with the number of
games they've played

4178
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:52,800
games they've played
 

4179
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,830
games they've played
and the total number of points right

4180
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:55,840
and the total number of points right
 

4181
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,149
and the total number of points right
now i see rational number i can't

4182
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
now i see rational number i can't
 

4183
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,030
now i see rational number i can't
compute that

4184
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
compute that
 

4185
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,709
compute that
right that's what we were talking about

4186
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
right that's what we were talking about
 

4187
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,790
right that's what we were talking about
last problem session right

4188
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:02,800
last problem session right
 

4189
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,470
last problem session right
but what i can do is i could store the

4190
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:04,480
but what i can do is i could store the
 

4191
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,669
but what i can do is i could store the
total number of games they played and

4192
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:05,679
total number of games they played and
 

4193
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:07,110
total number of games they played and
the total number of points they had

4194
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,120
the total number of points they had
 

4195
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,950
the total number of points they had
right and you could imagine by

4196
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:08,960
right and you could imagine by
 

4197
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,550
right and you could imagine by
augmentation similar to this

4198
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
augmentation similar to this
 

4199
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,830
augmentation similar to this
right every time i add a game

4200
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:13,840
right every time i add a game
 

4201
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,229
right every time i add a game
right one of these small operations i

4202
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:16,239
right one of these small operations i
 

4203
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:16,950
right one of these small operations i
can

4204
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:16,960
can
 

4205
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,750
can
update that information for each player

4206
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
update that information for each player
 

4207
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,270
update that information for each player
right

4208
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:21,280
right
 

4209
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,990
right
right if i'm just if one of these these

4210
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,000
right if i'm just if one of these these
 

4211
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,910
right if i'm just if one of these these
dynamic operations is affecting only one

4212
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:25,920
dynamic operations is affecting only one
 

4213
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,110
dynamic operations is affecting only one
receiver

4214
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
receiver
 

4215
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,550
receiver
i can you know update whatever it is in

4216
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:30,560
i can you know update whatever it is in
 

4217
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,550
i can you know update whatever it is in
in constant time probably right if i

4218
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
in constant time probably right if i
 

4219
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,629
in constant time probably right if i
just store with the player

4220
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:34,639
just store with the player
 

4221
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:37,030
just store with the player
what their total number of games is as

4222
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:37,040
what their total number of games is as
 

4223
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,629
what their total number of games is as
recorded by the database

4224
01:20:38,629 --> 01:20:38,639
recorded by the database
 

4225
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,270
recorded by the database
and how many points they've scored then

4226
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:41,280
and how many points they've scored then
 

4227
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,709
and how many points they've scored then
if i have a data structure

4228
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:42,719
if i have a data structure
 

4229
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:45,750
if i have a data structure
that needs to sort

4230
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:45,760
that needs to sort
 

4231
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,750
that needs to sort
the receivers by their performance so i

4232
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:47,760
the receivers by their performance so i
 

4233
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,830
the receivers by their performance so i
might be able to find the kth one

4234
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:49,840
might be able to find the kth one
 

4235
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,229
might be able to find the kth one
right the k largest then

4236
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,239
right the k largest then
 

4237
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,550
right the k largest then
i can't compute that performance but

4238
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,560
i can't compute that performance but
 

4239
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,030
i can't compute that performance but
what can i do

4240
01:20:59,030 --> 01:20:59,040
what can i do
 

4241
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,750
what can i do
i can compare two players based on their

4242
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:01,760
i can compare two players based on their
 

4243
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,070
i can compare two players based on their
performance using cross multiplication

4244
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,080
performance using cross multiplication
 

4245
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,030
performance using cross multiplication
right right because i have the numerator

4246
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,040
right right because i have the numerator
 

4247
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,229
right right because i have the numerator
and denominator of each of these

4248
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:08,239
and denominator of each of these
 

4249
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,310
and denominator of each of these
rationals and i can cross multiply

4250
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
rationals and i can cross multiply
 

4251
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,149
rationals and i can cross multiply
and figure out whether one's bigger or

4252
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:12,159
and figure out whether one's bigger or
 

4253
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,910
and figure out whether one's bigger or
smaller and as long as i have a

4254
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:13,920
smaller and as long as i have a
 

4255
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,950
smaller and as long as i have a
comparator

4256
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:14,960
comparator
 

4257
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,990
comparator
i can do set jbl stuff does that make

4258
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
i can do set jbl stuff does that make
 

4259
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,950
i can do set jbl stuff does that make
sense

4260
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:18,960
sense
 

4261
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,189
sense
okay so that's the i'm just going to

4262
01:21:21,189 --> 01:21:21,199
okay so that's the i'm just going to
 

4263
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,950
okay so that's the i'm just going to
outline kind of the

4264
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:22,960
outline kind of the
 

4265
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,830
outline kind of the
the components of this data structure

4266
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:26,840
the components of this data structure
 

4267
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,709
the components of this data structure
okay well first off uh i'm gonna need to

4268
01:21:30,709 --> 01:21:30,719
okay well first off uh i'm gonna need to
 

4269
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,270
okay well first off uh i'm gonna need to
record a receiver and a receiver could

4270
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,280
record a receiver and a receiver could
 

4271
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,470
record a receiver and a receiver could
have a lot of games

4272
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:34,480
have a lot of games
 

4273
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,149
have a lot of games
but the important this is kind of a

4274
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:36,159
but the important this is kind of a
 

4275
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,070
but the important this is kind of a
receiver centric kind of problem does

4276
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:38,080
receiver centric kind of problem does
 

4277
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,430
receiver centric kind of problem does
that make sense to you guys

4278
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:39,440
that make sense to you guys
 

4279
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,990
that make sense to you guys
right i'm not ever wanting to filter on

4280
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
right i'm not ever wanting to filter on
 

4281
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,830
right i'm not ever wanting to filter on
all the receivers playing a game

4282
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:43,840
all the receivers playing a game
 

4283
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:48,390
all the receivers playing a game
right i'm never like removing

4284
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:48,400

 

4285
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,910

i'm never removing a game from the

4286
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:49,920
i'm never removing a game from the
 

4287
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,910
i'm never removing a game from the
system i'm removing a

4288
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:51,920
system i'm removing a
 

4289
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,990
system i'm removing a
receiver from ever playing in a specific

4290
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
receiver from ever playing in a specific
 

4291
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,510
receiver from ever playing in a specific
game does that make sense

4292
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
game does that make sense
 

4293
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,790
game does that make sense
so if i'm storing a receiver and each

4294
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
so if i'm storing a receiver and each
 

4295
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,830
so if i'm storing a receiver and each
receiver has

4296
01:21:59,830 --> 01:21:59,840
receiver has
 

4297
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,149
receiver has
some games associated with them kind of

4298
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:02,159
some games associated with them kind of
 

4299
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,310
some games associated with them kind of
makes sense i might want to have

4300
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
makes sense i might want to have
 

4301
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,510
makes sense i might want to have
a nested data structure right where

4302
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,520
a nested data structure right where
 

4303
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,149
a nested data structure right where
with maybe i have a a dictionary on

4304
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:10,159
with maybe i have a a dictionary on
 

4305
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:11,430
with maybe i have a a dictionary on
receivers

4306
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:11,440
receivers
 

4307
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,229
receivers
and for each one i store all the games

4308
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239
and for each one i store all the games
 

4309
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,350
and for each one i store all the games
that they've played it

4310
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360
that they've played it
 

4311
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,430
that they've played it
in some other data structure right with

4312
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
in some other data structure right with
 

4313
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,470
in some other data structure right with
each receiver

4314
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
each receiver
 

4315
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,709
each receiver
i store another its own data structure

4316
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:20,719
i store another its own data structure
 

4317
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,070
i store another its own data structure
containing all its games so that makes

4318
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:22,080
containing all its games so that makes
 

4319
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,430
containing all its games so that makes
sense

4320
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:23,440
sense
 

4321
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,629
sense
okay so that's the idea right we have

4322
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
okay so that's the idea right we have
 

4323
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:27,430
okay so that's the idea right we have
some kind of

4324
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:27,440
some kind of
 

4325
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,470
some kind of
i need to be able to look up receivers

4326
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:30,480
i need to be able to look up receivers
 

4327
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,270
i need to be able to look up receivers
right because uh you know i'm i'm

4328
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,280
right because uh you know i'm i'm
 

4329
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,390
right because uh you know i'm i'm
clearing them or i'm

4330
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:34,400
clearing them or i'm
 

4331
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,189
clearing them or i'm
recording them right so i'm gonna have a

4332
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
recording them right so i'm gonna have a
 

4333
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,390
recording them right so i'm gonna have a
you know

4334
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:38,400
you know
 

4335
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,709
you know
a dictionary or you know here i'm

4336
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:40,719
a dictionary or you know here i'm
 

4337
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,709
a dictionary or you know here i'm
looking for worst case login time

4338
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:42,719
looking for worst case login time
 

4339
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,550
looking for worst case login time
so i'm going to you know skip the

4340
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:44,560
so i'm going to you know skip the
 

4341
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,229
so i'm going to you know skip the
dictionary abstraction and go straight

4342
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:46,239
dictionary abstraction and go straight
 

4343
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:49,110
dictionary abstraction and go straight

okay uh set avl tree on receivers

4358
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:15,199
okay uh set avl tree on receivers
 

4359
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,149
okay uh set avl tree on receivers
and each one of those nodes right with

each one of those receivers
 

4363
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:24,500
each one of those receivers
i'm going to store for each

4364
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:24,510
i'm going to store for each

store a set

4368
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:29,600
store a set
 

4369
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:35,430
store a set
avl on games

4370
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:35,440
avl on games
 

4371
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,310
avl on games
okay why do i store a set avl on games

4372
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,320
okay why do i store a set avl on games
 

4373
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,910
okay why do i store a set avl on games
why don't i just store a list of all the

4374
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:39,920
why don't i just store a list of all the
 

4375
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,310
why don't i just store a list of all the
games

4376
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:42,320

 

4377
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,229

because if i want to remove this game

4378
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:44,239
because if i want to remove this game
 

4379
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,310
because if i want to remove this game
from a receiver i need to do that in

4380
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
from a receiver i need to do that in
 

4381
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,669
from a receiver i need to do that in
login time and

4382
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
login time and
 

4383
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,910
login time and
here what we're saying is that n is the

4384
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:49,920
here what we're saying is that n is the
 

4385
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,270
here what we're saying is that n is the
number of games

4386
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
number of games
 

4387
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,590
number of games
but the the number of receivers on the

4388
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
but the the number of receivers on the
 

4389
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,030
but the the number of receivers on the
team is always less than the number of

4390
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
team is always less than the number of
 

4391
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,149
team is always less than the number of
games so

4392
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:56,159
games so
 

4393
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,270
games so
right if i search in this avl tree

4394
01:23:59,270 --> 01:23:59,280
right if i search in this avl tree
 

4395
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,390
right if i search in this avl tree
and i search in its avl tree i can

4396
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:02,400
and i search in its avl tree i can
 

4397
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,149
and i search in its avl tree i can
be assured that those two searches was

4398
01:24:04,149 --> 01:24:04,159
be assured that those two searches was
 

4399
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,070
be assured that those two searches was
only login

4400
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:06,080
only login
 

4401
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,229
only login
yeah because i might i need to remove a

4402
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
yeah because i might i need to remove a
 

4403
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:09,189
yeah because i might i need to remove a
game right so

4404
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:09,199
game right so
 

4405
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:12,310
game right so
there you go then

4406
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320
there you go then
 

4407
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,629
there you go then
what am i doing i'm returning the k

4408
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:14,639
what am i doing i'm returning the k
 

4409
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,709
what am i doing i'm returning the k
highest performance well i need for with

4410
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719
highest performance well i need for with
 

4411
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,229
highest performance well i need for with
each one of these guys

4412
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:18,239
each one of these guys
 

4413
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:22,870
each one of these guys
i also store what was this augmentation

4414
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880
i also store what was this augmentation
 

4415
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,110
i also store what was this augmentation
the sum of the points stored in these

4416
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,120
the sum of the points stored in these
 

4417
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,070
the sum of the points stored in these
games right

4418
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,080

 

4419
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,310

sum of points

4420
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:32,320

 

4421
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,790

and uh what was it

4422
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:36,800
and uh what was it
 

4423
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,910
and uh what was it
number games

4424
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:39,920
number games
 

4425
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,590
number games
because if i store both of those things

4426
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:41,600
because if i store both of those things
 

4427
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,510
because if i store both of those things
in constant time i'm going to be able to

4428
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:43,520
in constant time i'm going to be able to
 

4429
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:43,990
in constant time i'm going to be able to
compute

4430
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
compute
 

4431
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,629
compute
their performance right where i'm going

4432
01:24:46,629 --> 01:24:46,639
their performance right where i'm going
 

4433
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:47,430
their performance right where i'm going
to be able to

4434
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:47,440
to be able to
 

4435
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,830
to be able to
you have the data i need to compare

4436
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
you have the data i need to compare
 

4437
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,430
you have the data i need to compare
performances yeah so you just don't

4438
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:51,440
performances yeah so you just don't
 

4439
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,590
performances yeah so you just don't
have variables yeah yeah it's just

4440
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:53,600
have variables yeah yeah it's just
 

4441
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,550
have variables yeah yeah it's just
numbers

4442
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:54,560
numbers
 

4443
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,990
numbers
right these aren't data structures this

4444
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,000
right these aren't data structures this
 

4445
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,709
right these aren't data structures this
is data structure these are just numbers

4446
01:24:58,709 --> 01:24:58,719
is data structure these are just numbers
 

4447
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,790
is data structure these are just numbers
okay i'm storing that with each receiver

4448
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:02,800
okay i'm storing that with each receiver
 

4449
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,070
okay i'm storing that with each receiver
right but that's not going to help me

4450
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,080
right but that's not going to help me
 

4451
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,430
right but that's not going to help me
find the kth

4452
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:07,440
find the kth
 

4453
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,189
find the kth
highest player right none of these

4454
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:09,199
highest player right none of these
 

4455
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:13,350
highest player right none of these
things are sorted by performance right

4456
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,360
things are sorted by performance right
 

4457
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:24,830
things are sorted by performance right
so i need the last data structure

4458
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:24,840

01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,470

i need to store something dynamically

4462
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:30,480
i need to store something dynamically
 

4463
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,430
i need to store something dynamically
sorted by

you want to mention something about the

4478
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:57,199
you want to mention something about the
 

4479
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,550
you want to mention something about the
cross multiplication

4480
01:25:58,550 --> 01:25:58,560
cross multiplication
 

4481
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,070
cross multiplication
right like i'm storing with each one of

4482
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:00,080
right like i'm storing with each one of
 

4483
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,470
right like i'm storing with each one of
these things this augmentation

4484
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:02,480
these things this augmentation
 

4485
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,070
these things this augmentation
and when i'm comparing two things i'm

4486
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,080
and when i'm comparing two things i'm
 

4487
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,750
and when i'm comparing two things i'm
using cross multiplication

4488
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:05,760
using cross multiplication
 

4489
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,990
using cross multiplication
but other than that then we can abstract

4490
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:08,000
but other than that then we can abstract
 

4491
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,030
but other than that then we can abstract
it away right you've

4492
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:09,040
it away right you've
 

4493
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,070
it away right you've
abstracted that function call and i can

4494
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:12,080
abstracted that function call and i can
 

4495
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,550
abstracted that function call and i can
imagine comparing two keys i can do this

4496
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:14,560
imagine comparing two keys i can do this
 

4497
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,070
imagine comparing two keys i can do this
right this is a theory thing i'm not

4498
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,080
right this is a theory thing i'm not
 

4499
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,590
right this is a theory thing i'm not
asking you to implement that

4500
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:17,600
asking you to implement that
 

4501
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,629
asking you to implement that
right but that's sufficient for me as a

4502
01:26:20,629 --> 01:26:20,639
right but that's sufficient for me as a
 

4503
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,149
right but that's sufficient for me as a
reader of your solution

4504
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:22,159
reader of your solution
 

4505
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,910
reader of your solution
to be able to say yeah you know what

4506
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:23,920
to be able to say yeah you know what
 

4507
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,270
to be able to say yeah you know what
you're talking about

4508
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:25,280
you're talking about
 

4509
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,870
you're talking about
okay all right so how do i connect these

4510
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:28,880
okay all right so how do i connect these
 

4511
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:29,590
okay all right so how do i connect these
things

4512
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,600
things
 

4513
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,110
things
right the thing is i'm going to need to

4514
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:31,120
right the thing is i'm going to need to
 

4515
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,070
right the thing is i'm going to need to
be uh i need to update this

4516
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,080
be uh i need to update this
 

4517
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:37,430
be uh i need to update this
these things right when i

4518
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,440
these things right when i
 

4519
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:41,270
these things right when i
insert or remove a game right

4520
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280

 

4521
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,990

so how do i know where these receivers

4522
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,000
so how do i know where these receivers
 

4523
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,470
so how do i know where these receivers
are

4524
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:44,480
are
 

4525
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,550
are
in this thing i store a pointer into

4526
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
in this thing i store a pointer into
 

4527
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,470
in this thing i store a pointer into
this data structure right

4528
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,480
this data structure right
 

4529
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:56,550
this data structure right
so up here i store a pointer

4530
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:56,560

 

4531
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,229

right to where it is in the data

4532
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:58,239
right to where it is in the data
 

4533
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,310
right to where it is in the data
structure right again i'm storing all

4534
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:00,320
structure right again i'm storing all
 

4535
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,189
structure right again i'm storing all
the receivers

4536
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:01,199
the receivers
 

4537
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,669
the receivers
this has the same size as the number one

4538
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:03,679
this has the same size as the number one
 

4539
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:04,790
this has the same size as the number one
data structure up there

4540
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
data structure up there
 

4541
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,430
data structure up there
has the same number of receivers right

4542
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:09,440

 

4543
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,870

but we're not quite done yet because i'm

4544
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:12,880
but we're not quite done yet because i'm
 

4545
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,390
but we're not quite done yet because i'm
not wanting to know

4546
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
not wanting to know
 

4547
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,790
not wanting to know
like who has the the best

4548
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:18,800
like who has the the best
 

4549
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,149
like who has the the best
performance right i want to know who has

4550
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:22,159
performance right i want to know who has
 

4551
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:22,629
performance right i want to know who has
the

4552
01:27:22,629 --> 01:27:22,639
the
 

4553
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:27,270
the
kaith best performance ugh

4554
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,280
kaith best performance ugh
 

4555
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,510
kaith best performance ugh
how do i find the kate best thing in

4556
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
how do i find the kate best thing in
 

4557
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,830
how do i find the kate best thing in
this treat right i've got a tree

4558
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:31,840
this treat right i've got a tree
 

4559
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,270
this treat right i've got a tree
right set avl tree it's

4560
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280
right set avl tree it's
 

4561
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,350
right set avl tree it's
mapped on performance right i know where

4562
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,360
mapped on performance right i know where
 

4563
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,790
mapped on performance right i know where
the last one is

4564
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:38,800
the last one is
 

4565
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,790
the last one is
but if i want to find the kate one from

4566
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:40,800
but if i want to find the kate one from
 

4567
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,070
but if i want to find the kate one from
the end how do i do that

4568
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:44,080

 

4569
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,189

it's an avl tree a set avl tree

4570
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:47,199
it's an avl tree a set avl tree
 

4571
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,550
it's an avl tree a set avl tree
all i'm storing is heights is there an

4572
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:50,560
all i'm storing is heights is there an
 

4573
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,550
all i'm storing is heights is there an
operation that you've

4574
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:52,560
operation that you've
 

4575
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,390
operation that you've
thought about you're not storing the

4576
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:56,400
thought about you're not storing the
 

4577
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,270
thought about you're not storing the
size of each

4578
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:57,280
size of each
 

4579
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:01,030
size of each
ah a set avl tree by default does not

4580
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:01,040
ah a set avl tree by default does not
 

4581
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,950
ah a set avl tree by default does not
store sizes right that's what a sequence

4582
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:02,960
store sizes right that's what a sequence
 

4583
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,070
store sizes right that's what a sequence
does

4584
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:04,080
does
 

4585
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,590
does
but you think maybe that would be

4586
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:05,600
but you think maybe that would be
 

4587
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,350
but you think maybe that would be
helpful in this situation

4588
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:07,360
helpful in this situation
 

4589
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,110
helpful in this situation
right yeah so actually if i decided to

4590
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:11,120
right yeah so actually if i decided to
 

4591
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,790
right yeah so actually if i decided to
augment by sizes also i could do the

4592
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:12,800
augment by sizes also i could do the
 

4593
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,470
augment by sizes also i could do the
exact same kind of sequence

4594
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:14,480
exact same kind of sequence
 

4595
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,750
exact same kind of sequence
find at operation right and i could be

4596
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:17,760
find at operation right and i could be
 

4597
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,950
find at operation right and i could be
able to look up

4598
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:18,960
able to look up
 

4599
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,629
able to look up
the n minus k item right

4600
01:28:22,629 --> 01:28:22,639
the n minus k item right
 

4601
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:25,830
the n minus k item right
in here using the exact same function

4602
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:25,840
in here using the exact same function
 

4603
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,870
in here using the exact same function
for subtree at that i had

4604
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:28,880
for subtree at that i had
 

4605
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,910
for subtree at that i had
in the sequence avl tree stuff right so

4606
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:31,920
in the sequence avl tree stuff right so
 

4607
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,990
in the sequence avl tree stuff right so
actually in clrs they don't even bother

4608
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:34,000
actually in clrs they don't even bother
 

4609
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,590
actually in clrs they don't even bother
with sequence avl trees

4610
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:35,600
with sequence avl trees
 

4611
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,750
with sequence avl trees
right they go straight to if i wanted

4612
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:37,760
right they go straight to if i wanted
 

4613
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,590
right they go straight to if i wanted
this rank find functionality

4614
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:39,600
this rank find functionality
 

4615
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,669
this rank find functionality
on a sorted order of things right

4616
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:43,679
on a sorted order of things right
 

4617
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,550
on a sorted order of things right
then i could augment with subtree sizes

4618
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:46,560
then i could augment with subtree sizes
 

4619
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,189
then i could augment with subtree sizes
right

4620
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:47,199
right
 

4621
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,590
right
but it's actually a much more useful

4622
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:49,600
but it's actually a much more useful
 

4623
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,189
but it's actually a much more useful
general property

4624
01:28:51,189 --> 01:28:51,199
general property
 

4625
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,790
general property
so we decided to present it to you in

4626
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
so we decided to present it to you in
 

4627
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,790
so we decided to present it to you in
the in the context of sequence abs juice

4628
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:54,800
the in the context of sequence abs juice
 

4629
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,830
the in the context of sequence abs juice
because then i can just

4630
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:55,840
because then i can just
 

4631
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,510
because then i can just
basically reduce to it when i get to

4632
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:57,520
basically reduce to it when i get to
 

4633
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,950
basically reduce to it when i get to
here okay so

4634
01:28:58,950 --> 01:28:58,960
here okay so
 

4635
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,709
here okay so
that's kind of a structure of the data

4636
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:00,719
that's kind of a structure of the data
 

4637
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:02,310
that's kind of a structure of the data
structure that'll work on this problem

4638
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:02,320
structure that'll work on this problem
 

4639
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,229
structure that'll work on this problem
i leave it to you as an exercise to

4640
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
i leave it to you as an exercise to
 

4641
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,149
i leave it to you as an exercise to
implement all of these operations

4642
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:06,159
implement all of these operations
 

4643
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,430
implement all of these operations
for yourself or take a look at the

4644
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,440
for yourself or take a look at the
 

4645
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:11,750
for yourself or take a look at the
solutions the last one um

4646
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:11,760
solutions the last one um
 

4647
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,470
solutions the last one um
is going to be put online the solution

4648
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:14,480
is going to be put online the solution
 

4649
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,030
is going to be put online the solution
uh

4650
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,040
uh
 

4651
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,550
uh
it's pretty complicated it's what's

4652
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:16,560
it's pretty complicated it's what's
 

4653
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,470
it's pretty complicated it's what's
called you can think of the size

4654
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:18,480
called you can think of the size
 

4655
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,350
called you can think of the size
augmentation finding rank as a one-sided

4656
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:21,360
augmentation finding rank as a one-sided
 

4657
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,229
augmentation finding rank as a one-sided
range query

4658
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:22,239
range query
 

4659
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,229
range query
it's basically how many things are to

4660
01:29:24,229 --> 01:29:24,239
it's basically how many things are to
 

4661
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,070
it's basically how many things are to
the right of this value

4662
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:26,080
the right of this value
 

4663
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,270
the right of this value
right what the last problem does is

4664
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:29,280
right what the last problem does is
 

4665
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,030
right what the last problem does is
walks you through a two-sided range

4666
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,040
walks you through a two-sided range
 

4667
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:31,510
walks you through a two-sided range
query

4668
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:31,520
query
 

4669
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,189
query
right where i want to know how many

4670
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:33,199
right where i want to know how many
 

4671
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,590
right where i want to know how many
nodes are between these two values

4672
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:35,600
nodes are between these two values
 

4673
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,110
nodes are between these two values
okay so it's a walk-through

4674
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:39,120
okay so it's a walk-through
 

4675
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:48,480
okay so it's a walk-through
all right thanks guys
