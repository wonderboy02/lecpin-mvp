that I think we'll see a lot in the

86
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
that I think we'll see a lot in the
 

87
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,429
that I think we'll see a lot in the
homework uh is we typically use S for

88
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:50,439
homework uh is we typically use S for
 

89
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,190
homework uh is we typically use S for
the sort of starting point of a path or

sometimes the source if we're talking

92
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
sometimes the source if we're talking
 

93
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,910
sometimes the source if we're talking
about Network flows but I don't think we

94
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
about Network flows but I don't think we
 

95
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,910
about Network flows but I don't think we
do those in this class uh and then T is

96
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:58,920
do those in this class uh and then T is
 

97
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,590
do those in this class uh and then T is
usually the destination

98
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:00,600
usually the destination
 

99
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,190
usually the destination
um why T you might ask because it's the

100
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
um why T you might ask because it's the
 

101
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,270
um why T you might ask because it's the
letter after s uh right so uh our our

102
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
letter after s uh right so uh our our

algorithm what do we do we initially

132
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,200
algorithm what do we do we initially
 

133
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,990
algorithm what do we do we initially
label all of our vertices as having

134
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,000
label all of our vertices as having
 

135
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,830
label all of our vertices as having
distance Infinity to the source or and

136
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:44,840
distance Infinity to the source or and
 

137
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,430
distance Infinity to the source or and
and we insert them into our priority Q

138
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
and we insert them into our priority Q
 

139
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,149
and we insert them into our priority Q
except for one vertex which of course is

140
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:49,159
except for one vertex which of course is
 

141
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,149
except for one vertex which of course is
our source vertex uh and he or she has

142
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:52,159
our source vertex uh and he or she has
 

143
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,110
our source vertex uh and he or she has
vert uh has distance zero for an obvious

144
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
vert uh has distance zero for an obvious
 

145
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,630
vert uh has distance zero for an obvious
reason which is that if my path starts

146
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
reason which is that if my path starts
 

147
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,990
reason which is that if my path starts
at the source it has distance zero to

148
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,000
at the source it has distance zero to
 

149
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,270
at the source it has distance zero to
the source

150
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,280
the source
 

151
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,149
the source
so as our shorthand what was that do I

152
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:03,159
so as our shorthand what was that do I
 

153
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,309
so as our shorthand what was that do I
want to use red yes of course I

154
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
want to use red yes of course I
 

155
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,110
want to use red yes of course I
do

156
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,120
do
 

157
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,430
do
uh yeah but see it's this fat chalk man

158
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
uh yeah but see it's this fat chalk man
 

159
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,390
uh yeah but see it's this fat chalk man
um

160
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
um
 

161
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,750
um
okay zero I can make this work okay so

162
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:16,760
okay zero I can make this work okay so
 

163
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,229
okay zero I can make this work okay so
uh our our convention for today is going

164
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:19,239
uh our our convention for today is going
 

165
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,309
uh our our convention for today is going
to be if a Vertex does not have a label

166
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:21,319
to be if a Vertex does not have a label
 

167
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,869
to be if a Vertex does not have a label
on it it is distance

168
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
on it it is distance
 

169
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,070
on it it is distance
Infinity okay uh so what does Dyer's

170
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
Infinity okay uh so what does Dyer's
 

171
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,990
Infinity okay uh so what does Dyer's
algorithm do uh Dyer's algorithm grabs

172
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,000
algorithm do uh Dyer's algorithm grabs
 

173
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,030
algorithm do uh Dyer's algorithm grabs
the closest vertex that I haven't yet

174
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,040
the closest vertex that I haven't yet
 

175
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,670
the closest vertex that I haven't yet
processed uh and closest in terms of the

176
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:34,680
processed uh and closest in terms of the
 

177
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,390
processed uh and closest in terms of the
distance value that I've stored at that

178
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
distance value that I've stored at that
 

179
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,309
distance value that I've stored at that
vertex and then updates all of its

180
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
vertex and then updates all of its
 

181
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,789
vertex and then updates all of its
neighbors using sort of a triangle

182
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:39,799
neighbors using sort of a triangle
 

183
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,710
neighbors using sort of a triangle
inequality uh style construction so

184
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:41,720
inequality uh style construction so
 

185
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,990
inequality uh style construction so
let's see what that looks like so so far

186
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,000
let's see what that looks like so so far
 

187
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,990
let's see what that looks like so so far
everything is distance Infinity away

188
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,000
everything is distance Infinity away
 

189
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,869
everything is distance Infinity away
except for one vertex which is vertex s

190
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:49,879
except for one vertex which is vertex s
 

191
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,229
except for one vertex which is vertex s
which is distance zero so obviously that

192
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,239
which is distance zero so obviously that
 

193
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,990
which is distance zero so obviously that
should be our first iteration of D's

194
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,000
should be our first iteration of D's
 

195
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,670
should be our first iteration of D's
algorithm and now what vertex s is going

196
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
algorithm and now what vertex s is going
 

197
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,110
algorithm and now what vertex s is going
to do is look at all of s's neighbors

198
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,120
to do is look at all of s's neighbors
 

199
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,429
to do is look at all of s's neighbors
and update them using the triangle in

200
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
and update them using the triangle in
 

201
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,509
and update them using the triangle in
equality quality and if they're Closer

202
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
equality quality and if they're Closer
 

203
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,470
equality quality and if they're Closer
by having a path through S to the

204
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480
by having a path through S to the
 

205
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,630
by having a path through S to the
neighbor then I update the distance and

206
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:05,640
neighbor then I update the distance and
 

207
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,309
neighbor then I update the distance and
if it's not then I don't uh in this case

208
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
if it's not then I don't uh in this case
 

209
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,990
if it's not then I don't uh in this case
everything is infinity so it's pretty

210
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
everything is infinity so it's pretty
 

211
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,350
everything is infinity so it's pretty
clear that I should route my path

212
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
clear that I should route my path
 

213
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,229
clear that I should route my path
through S because any distance less than

214
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
through S because any distance less than
 

215
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,550
through S because any distance less than
infinity is smaller than infinity uh so

216
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
infinity is smaller than infinity uh so
 

217
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,390
infinity is smaller than infinity uh so
in particular notice that there's an

218
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
in particular notice that there's an
 

219
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,550
in particular notice that there's an
edge of length eight from s to a so now

220
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:21,560
edge of length eight from s to a so now
 

221
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,390
edge of length eight from s to a so now
rather than being distance Infinity away

222
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,400
rather than being distance Infinity away
 

223
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,390
rather than being distance Infinity away
I can see that vertex a is really

224
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
I can see that vertex a is really
 

225
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,629
I can see that vertex a is really
distance eight away oh this truck gives

226
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
uh similarly here there's an edge of

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,710
uh similarly here there's an edge of

00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
edges out of s so we're good and now the
 

237
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,230

little bit implicit in the construction

242
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:46,520
little bit implicit in the construction

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,550
little bit implicit in the construction
we saw yesterday but but that's okay is

244
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
we saw yesterday but but that's okay is
 

245
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,590
we saw yesterday but but that's okay is
that once I visit a Vertex I never I

246
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:50,600
that once I visit a Vertex I never I
 

247
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,390
that once I visit a Vertex I never I
never touch it again right it gets

251
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,550
frozen in time uh in in distance I
suppose uh but in any event what that

00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
suppose uh but in any event what that
 

253
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,590
suppose uh but in any event what that
means I'm going to pull a little box

254
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
means I'm going to pull a little box
 

255
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,510
means I'm going to pull a little box
around it meaning I'm done with this guy

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,510
hopefully our pictorial system makes
some sense here again on your homework

262
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,520
some sense here again on your homework

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,510
some sense here again on your homework
problem you actually have to write this

264
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
problem you actually have to write this
 

265
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,670
problem you actually have to write this
stuff out and I'm sorry that sucks uh

266
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
stuff out and I'm sorry that sucks uh
 

267
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,790
stuff out and I'm sorry that sucks uh
but I don't have to because I'm talking

268
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
but I don't have to because I'm talking
 

269
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,830
but I don't have to because I'm talking
to you all today okay so remember D's

270
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
to you all today okay so remember D's
 

271
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,310
to you all today okay so remember D's
algorithm we're going to look at our

272
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,320
algorithm we're going to look at our
 

273
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,909
algorithm we're going to look at our
list of vertices we haven't seen yet so

274
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:18,919
list of vertices we haven't seen yet so
 

275
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,670
list of vertices we haven't seen yet so
that's everything except for S find the

276
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:20,680
that's everything except for S find the
 

277
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,390
that's everything except for S find the
one that's closest and process that one

278
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
one that's closest and process that one
 

279
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,670
one that's closest and process that one
next so in this case that's the seven

280
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:24,680
next so in this case that's the seven
 

281
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,909
next so in this case that's the seven
here uh okay so let's take a look what

282
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:26,919
here uh okay so let's take a look what
 

283
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,070
here uh okay so let's take a look what
are the neighbors of seven well I've got

284
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,080
are the neighbors of seven well I've got
 

285
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,270
are the neighbors of seven well I've got
s

286
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
s
 

287
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,710
s
uh and that's oh and D here okay so

288
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
uh and that's oh and D here okay so
 

289
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,469
uh and that's oh and D here okay so
first of all let's take a look at s

290
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
first of all let's take a look at s
 

291
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,230
first of all let's take a look at s
obviously if I have a path that goes

292
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
obviously if I have a path that goes
 

293
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,510
obviously if I have a path that goes
through C back through this vertical

294
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,520
through C back through this vertical
 

295
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,350
through C back through this vertical
Edge to s that path to have length eight

296
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
Edge to s that path to have length eight
 

297
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,469
Edge to s that path to have length eight
right 7 + 1 eight is bigger than zero so

298
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
right 7 + 1 eight is bigger than zero so
 

299
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,390
right 7 + 1 eight is bigger than zero so
I do not update s but we actually

300
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
I do not update s but we actually
 

301
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,110
I do not update s but we actually
already knew that because s was frozen

302
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,120
already knew that because s was frozen
 

303
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,150
already knew that because s was frozen
here so I didn't even have to look at

304
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,160
here so I didn't even have to look at
 

305
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,350
here so I didn't even have to look at
that edge I could have removed it if I

306
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:52,360
that edge I could have removed it if I
 

307
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,110
that edge I could have removed it if I
wanted

308
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
wanted
 

309
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,230
wanted
to uh okay but there's another Edge

310
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
to uh okay but there's another Edge
 

311
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,790
to uh okay but there's another Edge
coming out of C which is pointing toward

312
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:57,800
coming out of C which is pointing toward
 

313
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,430
coming out of C which is pointing toward
D that has length four 7+ 4 is wait for

314
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
D that has length four 7+ 4 is wait for
 

315
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,390
D that has length four 7+ 4 is wait for
it 11 uh and that's less than infinity

316
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
it 11 uh and that's less than infinity
 

317
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,029
it 11 uh and that's less than infinity
so I update D's distance to 11 and I

318
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:08,039
so I update D's distance to 11 and I
 

319
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,150
so I update D's distance to 11 and I
don't think I've managed to make a

320
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,160
don't think I've managed to make a
 

321
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,950
don't think I've managed to make a
mistake yet uh okay so now uh We've

322
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
mistake yet uh okay so now uh We've
 

323
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,909
mistake yet uh okay so now uh We've
looked at all the edges out of

324
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:14,919
looked at all the edges out of
 

325
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,870
looked at all the edges out of
C and C is frozen and we move on okay

326
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:19,880
C and C is frozen and we move on okay
 

327
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,950
C and C is frozen and we move on okay
next uh let's see among our vertices we

328
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:21,960
next uh let's see among our vertices we
 

329
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,309
next uh let's see among our vertices we
have Infinity 8 and 11 so the smallest

330
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
have Infinity 8 and 11 so the smallest
 

331
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,629
have Infinity 8 and 11 so the smallest
of those three numbers is eight and

332
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
of those three numbers is eight and
 

333
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,710
of those three numbers is eight and
we're going to update all the neighbors

334
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720
we're going to update all the neighbors
 

335
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,790
we're going to update all the neighbors
of the eight uh which thankfully

336
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:29,800
of the eight uh which thankfully
 

337
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,749
of the eight uh which thankfully
although this graph looks big uh they

338
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:32,759
although this graph looks big uh they
 

339
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,629
although this graph looks big uh they
had some mercy on your your section inst

340
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
had some mercy on your your section inst
 

341
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,790
had some mercy on your your section inst
structure today and and really there

342
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:35,800
structure today and and really there
 

343
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,510
structure today and and really there
aren't that many edges so this isn't too

344
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
aren't that many edges so this isn't too
 

345
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,270
aren't that many edges so this isn't too
hard to uh process but here's the thing

346
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,280
hard to uh process but here's the thing
 

347
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,510
hard to uh process but here's the thing
uh there's an edge of length Zero from a

348
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,520
uh there's an edge of length Zero from a
 

349
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,189
uh there's an edge of length Zero from a
to d here I can get to the a in eight

350
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:46,199
to d here I can get to the a in eight
 

351
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,990
to d here I can get to the a in eight
units so I can also get to the D in

352
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
units so I can also get to the D in
 

353
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,629
units so I can also get to the D in
eight units uh by traversing that edge

354
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
eight units uh by traversing that edge
 

355
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,110
eight units uh by traversing that edge
eight is less than 11 that's good news

356
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
eight is less than 11 that's good news
 

357
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,710
eight is less than 11 that's good news
do I want to erase it or scratch it out

358
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
do I want to erase it or scratch it out
 

359
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,790
do I want to erase it or scratch it out
what's going to be better I'll scratch

360
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
what's going to be better I'll scratch
 

361
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,029
what's going to be better I'll scratch
it out just to be messy okay so now uh D

362
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
it out just to be messy okay so now uh D
 

363
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,510
it out just to be messy okay so now uh D
is a distance eight from a Vertex s and

364
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
is a distance eight from a Vertex s and
 

365
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,070
is a distance eight from a Vertex s and
I believe that's all the edges out of

366
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,080

 

367
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,150

a so a

368
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,160
a so a
 

369
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,710
a so a
set okay this fun or what so now we look

370
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
set okay this fun or what so now we look
 

371
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,110
set okay this fun or what so now we look
at all the edges out of oh oh sorry we

372
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
at all the edges out of oh oh sorry we
 

373
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,230
at all the edges out of oh oh sorry we
step back and we look at all of our uh

374
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,240
step back and we look at all of our uh
 

375
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,070
step back and we look at all of our uh
vertices we find the closest one that's

376
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,080
vertices we find the closest one that's
 

377
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,189
vertices we find the closest one that's
D now we got to update all of D's

378
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
D now we got to update all of D's
 

379
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,350
D now we got to update all of D's
neighbors so uh thankfully all the

380
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
neighbors so uh thankfully all the
 

381
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,589
neighbors so uh thankfully all the
remaining vertices have distance

382
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:26,599
remaining vertices have distance
 

383
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,430
remaining vertices have distance
Infinity uh so what do we know there's

384
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
Infinity uh so what do we know there's
 

385
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,110
Infinity uh so what do we know there's
an edge of length one here so I get a n

386
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,120
an edge of length one here so I get a n
 

387
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,029
an edge of length one here so I get a n
there's an edge of length two so I get a

388
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
there's an edge of length two so I get a
 

389
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,589
there's an edge of length two so I get a
10 um and I believe those are all the

390
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
10 um and I believe those are all the
 

391
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,909
10 um and I believe those are all the
outgoing edges from d and now D is set

392
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
outgoing edges from d and now D is set
 

393
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,150
outgoing edges from d and now D is set
I'm going to start moving faster because

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm going to start moving faster because
 

395
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,270
I'm going to start moving faster because
this is hella boring uh okay now the

396
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,280
this is hella boring uh okay now the
 

397
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,749
this is hella boring uh okay now the
next closest uh Edge is the nine uh

398
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:48,759
next closest uh Edge is the nine uh
 

399
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,510
next closest uh Edge is the nine uh
notice that the nine only or rather B I

400
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
notice that the nine only or rather B I
 

401
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,110
notice that the nine only or rather B I
suppose is the vertex which is currently

402
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,120
suppose is the vertex which is currently
 

403
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,749
suppose is the vertex which is currently
at distance 9 uh it only has one

404
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:56,759
at distance 9 uh it only has one
 

405
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,350
at distance 9 uh it only has one
neighbor that hasn't yet been processed

406
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,360
neighbor that hasn't yet been processed
 

407
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,350
neighbor that hasn't yet been processed
which is e uh so we know that that's 9

408
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
which is e uh so we know that that's 9
 

409
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,149
which is e uh so we know that that's 9
to 11 12 distance away I'm going to

410
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:05,159
to 11 12 distance away I'm going to
 

411
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,390
to 11 12 distance away I'm going to
check my scrap paper and make sure I

412
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
check my scrap paper and make sure I
 

413
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,149
check my scrap paper and make sure I
haven't made any mistakes yet seven

414
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:09,159
haven't made any mistakes yet seven

cool okay so now our next closest vertex

418
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
cool okay so now our next closest vertex
 

419
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,670
cool okay so now our next closest vertex
is vertex H which is distance 10 and aha

420
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:18,680
is vertex H which is distance 10 and aha
 

421
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,469
is vertex H which is distance 10 and aha
if I Traverse The Edge upward from H to

422
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:21,479
if I Traverse The Edge upward from H to
 

423
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,589
if I Traverse The Edge upward from H to
E I can get a path of length 11 and 11

424
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
E I can get a path of length 11 and 11
 

425
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,550
E I can get a path of length 11 and 11
according to most mathematicians is less

426
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,560
according to most mathematicians is less
 

427
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,950
according to most mathematicians is less
than 12 and hence we should update the

428
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:29,960
than 12 and hence we should update the
 

429
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,869
than 12 and hence we should update the
value

430
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
value
 

431
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,469
value
here uh in addition to that there is an

432
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:33,479
here uh in addition to that there is an
 

433
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,350
here uh in addition to that there is an
edge of length two out of H pointing

434
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
edge of length two out of H pointing
 

435
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,949
edge of length two out of H pointing
into G 10 + 2 is 12 and I believe that's

436
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
into G 10 + 2 is 12 and I believe that's
 

437
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,269
into G 10 + 2 is 12 and I believe that's
it getting there okay so the next

438
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:44,279
it getting there okay so the next
 

439
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,910
it getting there okay so the next
closest uh vertex is e e has no outgoing

440
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
closest uh vertex is e e has no outgoing
 

441
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,509
closest uh vertex is e e has no outgoing
edges so e is all

442
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
edges so e is all
 

443
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,430
edges so e is all
set uh after that we've got g g has an

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
set uh after that we've got g g has an
 

445
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,790

is 13 Which is less is larger than eight

448
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,200

449
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,829
is 13 Which is less is larger than eight
so we don't update uh and similarly 12+

450
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:04,839
so we don't update uh and similarly 12+
 

451
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,870
so we don't update uh and similarly 12+
0 is bigger than seven so we don't

452
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
0 is bigger than seven so we don't
 

453
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,590
0 is bigger than seven so we don't
update but again the edges that point

454
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:08,600
update but again the edges that point
 

455
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,230
update but again the edges that point
into vertices that we've already

into vertices that we've already
 

457
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,750
into vertices that we've already
processed we really don't have to even

algorithm Works notice that if there

462
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
algorithm Works notice that if there
 

463
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,150
algorithm Works notice that if there
were a negative weight Edge where we're

464
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,160
were a negative weight Edge where we're
 

465
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,910
were a negative weight Edge where we're
going to come back to uh then that

466
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:18,920
going to come back to uh then that
 

467
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,470
going to come back to uh then that
assumption would be problematic so the

468
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,480
assumption would be problematic so the
 

469
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,990
assumption would be problematic so the
takeaway here is that this guy's Frozen

470
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
takeaway here is that this guy's Frozen
 

471
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,509
takeaway here is that this guy's Frozen
in stone and now notice that our Q is

472
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:26,519
in stone and now notice that our Q is
 

473
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,590
in stone and now notice that our Q is
actually empty yeah so depending on how

474
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
actually empty yeah so depending on how
 

475
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,150
actually empty yeah so depending on how
we set up our well it's not empty um but

476
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
we set up our well it's not empty um but
 

477
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,230
we set up our well it's not empty um but
it only contains one vertex and it's at

478
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
it only contains one vertex and it's at
 

479
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,949
it only contains one vertex and it's at
uh distance

480
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:35,959
uh distance
 

481
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,470
uh distance
infinity infinity plus Z is still

482
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:39,480
infinity infinity plus Z is still
 

483
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,590
infinity infinity plus Z is still
Infinity uh so that's this guy's uh

484
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:42,600
Infinity uh so that's this guy's uh
 

485
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,949
Infinity uh so that's this guy's uh
distance here and now we're now our Q is

486
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
distance here and now we're now our Q is
 

487
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,829
distance here and now we're now our Q is
empty sorry okay so I

488
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
empty sorry okay so I
 

489
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,190
empty sorry okay so I
believe I managed to do that right

490
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,200
believe I managed to do that right
 

491
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,030
believe I managed to do that right
excellent so the problem ask for two

492
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,040
excellent so the problem ask for two
 

493
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,829
excellent so the problem ask for two
things it ask for the single Source uh

494
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
things it ask for the single Source uh
 

495
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,990
things it ask for the single Source uh
shortest path distance it also ask for

496
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
shortest path distance it also ask for
 

497
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,949
shortest path distance it also ask for
the traversal order which I forgot to do

498
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:57,959
the traversal order which I forgot to do
 

499
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,310
the traversal order which I forgot to do
while I was doing this problem but you

500
00:09:59,310 --> 00:09:59,320
while I was doing this problem but you
 

501
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,069
while I was doing this problem but you
could retrace it pretty easily okay so

502
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
could retrace it pretty easily okay so
 

503
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,949
could retrace it pretty easily okay so
uh that's part A then in Part B they say

504
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
uh that's part A then in Part B they say
 

505
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,190
uh that's part A then in Part B they say
change the weight of the Edge from G to

506
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,200
change the weight of the Edge from G to
 

507
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,590
change the weight of the Edge from G to
C to minus 6 so we have G to C and now

508
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
C to minus 6 so we have G to C and now
 

509
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,790
C to minus 6 so we have G to C and now
instead of zero we're going to make it

510
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
instead of zero we're going to make it
 

511
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,150
instead of zero we're going to make it
minus six and the question is if I ran

512
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
minus six and the question is if I ran
 

513
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,790
minus six and the question is if I ran
Dyer's algorithm essentially what would

514
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
Dyer's algorithm essentially what would
 

515
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,790
Dyer's algorithm essentially what would
break and I think it's pretty easy to

516
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
break and I think it's pretty easy to
 

517
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,430
break and I think it's pretty easy to
eyeball remember that g was essentially

518
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:24,440
eyeball remember that g was essentially
 

519
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,990
eyeball remember that g was essentially
the last interesting vertex that we

520
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
the last interesting vertex that we
 

521
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,630
the last interesting vertex that we
touched in our algorithm here the only

522
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:27,640
touched in our algorithm here the only
 

523
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,110
touched in our algorithm here the only
one that we looked at was was F

524
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,120
one that we looked at was was F
 

525
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,949
one that we looked at was was F
and so this outgoing Edge from G

526
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:31,959
and so this outgoing Edge from G
 

527
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,470
and so this outgoing Edge from G
actually wouldn't even be seen by d's

528
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:33,480
actually wouldn't even be seen by d's
 

529
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,710
actually wouldn't even be seen by d's
algorithm thankfully until we've touched

530
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:35,720
algorithm thankfully until we've touched
 

531
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,190

all these other vertices in an identical

532
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:38,200
all these other vertices in an identical
 

533
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,470
all these other vertices in an identical
fashion to our previous traversal uh and

534
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
fashion to our previous traversal uh and
 

535
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,870
fashion to our previous traversal uh and
then we finally get to G and now what's

536
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
then we finally get to G and now what's
 

537
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,430
then we finally get to G and now what's
going to happen well if I had this edge

538
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:44,440
going to happen well if I had this edge
 

539
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,829
going to happen well if I had this edge
of length Nega six what's 12 minus

540
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
of length Nega six what's 12 minus
 

541
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,710
of length Nega six what's 12 minus
6 it's six and notice that that's less

542
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:51,720
6 it's six and notice that that's less
 

543
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,910

than um seven which is the the label of

544
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:54,920
than um seven which is the the label of
 

545
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,829
than um seven which is the the label of
vertex C but that breaks our assumption

546
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839

547
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,509

00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:01,079
Vertex I never have to touch it again
 

551
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,110
Vertex I never have to touch it again
right because now I've identified a path

552
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
right because now I've identified a path
 

553
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,509
right because now I've identified a path
through G back to C that has a smaller

00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
through G back to C that has a smaller
 

555
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,110
through G back to C that has a smaller
distance than the path that c had when

556
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,120
distance than the path that c had when

it was visited in the Q so somehow

558
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:10,360
it was visited in the Q so somehow
 

559
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,629
it was visited in the Q so somehow
spiritually I should add C back to the Q

560
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:12,639
spiritually I should add C back to the Q
 

561
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,190
spiritually I should add C back to the Q
but that's against the rules in DA's

562
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,200
but that's against the rules in DA's
 

563
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,150
but that's against the rules in DA's
algorithm right so like for instance if

564
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
algorithm right so like for instance if
 

565
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,870
algorithm right so like for instance if
I did that I I would have to convince

566
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:17,880
I did that I I would have to convince
 

567
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,150
I did that I I would have to convince
myself that the runtime doesn't explode

568
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
myself that the runtime doesn't explode
 

569
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,910
myself that the runtime doesn't explode
uh and that this algorithm terminates

570
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
uh and that this algorithm terminates
 

571
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,750
uh and that this algorithm terminates
right which could be a problem if you

572
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:22,760
right which could be a problem if you
 

573
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,230
right which could be a problem if you
have a negative weight

574
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
have a negative weight
 

575
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,310
have a negative weight
cycle thankfully we have algorithms for

576
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
cycle thankfully we have algorithms for
 

577
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,030
cycle thankfully we have algorithms for
detecting negative weight Cycles but

578
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,040
detecting negative weight Cycles but
 

579
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,629
detecting negative weight Cycles but
that's a different matter

580
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:29,639
that's a different matter
 

581
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,790
that's a different matter
okay so I think this is pretty

582
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
okay so I think this is pretty
 

583
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,230
okay so I think this is pretty
straightforward it's just essentially

584
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
straightforward it's just essentially
 

585
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,069
straightforward it's just essentially
asking you to walk through DA's

00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
asking you to walk through DA's
 

587
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,949
asking you to walk through DA's
algorithm make sure you understand

588
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:35,959
algorithm make sure you understand

what's going on any uh questions about

590
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:38,440
what's going on any uh questions about
 

591
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,829
what's going on any uh questions about
that one cool I think this is one of the

592
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
that one cool I think this is one of the
 

593
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,430
that one cool I think this is one of the
easier uh problem sessions so maybe

594
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
easier uh problem sessions so maybe
 

595
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,030
easier uh problem sessions so maybe
we'll finish early except I always say

596
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
we'll finish early except I always say
 

597
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,269
we'll finish early except I always say
that I talk too much sorry not sorry

598
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:50,279
that I talk too much sorry not sorry
 

599
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,230
that I talk too much sorry not sorry
okay so uh right so in problem

600
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,240
okay so uh right so in problem
 

601
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,190
okay so uh right so in problem
s-2 um this is an extension of a problem

602
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,200
s-2 um this is an extension of a problem
 

603
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,069
s-2 um this is an extension of a problem
that we considered I believe two problem

604
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
that we considered I believe two problem
 

605
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,550

sessions ago

606
00:11:59,550 --> 00:11:59,560
sessions ago
 

607
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,389
sessions ago
uh and it looks something like this I'm

608
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:01,399
uh and it looks something like this I'm
 

609
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,629
uh and it looks something like this I'm
going to go back into my notes so

610
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:03,639
going to go back into my notes so
 

611
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,230
going to go back into my notes so
remember in two problem sessions ago we

612
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,240
remember in two problem sessions ago we
 

613
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,110
remember in two problem sessions ago we
defined the radius of a graph for an

614
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
defined the radius of a graph for an
 

615
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,509
defined the radius of a graph for an
unweighted graph we came up with an

616
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:08,519
unweighted graph we came up with an
 

617
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,629
unweighted graph we came up with an
algorithm for computing it and

618
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:09,639
algorithm for computing it and
 

619
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,230
algorithm for computing it and
approximating it all that good stuff uh

620
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
approximating it all that good stuff uh
 

621
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,269
approximating it all that good stuff uh
now in this problem uh we're going to do

622
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:14,279
now in this problem uh we're going to do
 

623
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,310
now in this problem uh we're going to do
basically the same thing but now we're

624
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
basically the same thing but now we're
 

625
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,750
basically the same thing but now we're
on a weighted graph yeah so in

626
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:18,760
on a weighted graph yeah so in
 

627
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,990
on a weighted graph yeah so in
particular we're going to define a

628
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
particular we're going to define a
 

629
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,389
particular we're going to define a
quantity this is problem two uh called

630
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:25,399

 

631
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,870

weighted

632
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,990
uh which is associated to a vertex in a
weighted graph uh and it looks like this

638
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,000
weighted graph uh and it looks like this
 

639
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,230
weighted graph uh and it looks like this
so the weighted eccentricity Associated

640
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,240
so the weighted eccentricity Associated
 

641
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,430
so the weighted eccentricity Associated
to vertex U is equal to the

642
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
to vertex U is equal to the
 

643
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,829
to vertex U is equal to the
max over all vertices in my graph of the

644
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
max over all vertices in my graph of the
 

645
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,350
max over all vertices in my graph of the
shortest path distance from U to that

646
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
shortest path distance from U to that
 

647
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,509
shortest path distance from U to that
vertex again hopefully our audience will

648
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
vertex again hopefully our audience will
 

649
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,030
vertex again hopefully our audience will
catch if I accidentally swap the

650
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
catch if I accidentally swap the
 

651
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,310
catch if I accidentally swap the
argument to shortest path because I'm

652
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
argument to shortest path because I'm
 

653
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,910
argument to shortest path because I'm
used to thinking of that as symmetric

654
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
used to thinking of that as symmetric
 

655
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,629
used to thinking of that as symmetric
but it's not uh because our graphs are

656
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
but it's not uh because our graphs are
 

657
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,509
but it's not uh because our graphs are
directed um actually in this problem I

658
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:02,519
directed um actually in this problem I
 

659
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,750
directed um actually in this problem I
don't think the graph is directed

660
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:04,760
don't think the graph is directed
 

661
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,350
don't think the graph is directed
so I forget it's directed okay good yeah

662
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:08,360
so I forget it's directed okay good yeah
 

663
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,189
so I forget it's directed okay good yeah
then good I'll try to be

664
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:11,199
then good I'll try to be
 

665
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,470
then good I'll try to be
accurate okay and just like the problem

666
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:13,480
accurate okay and just like the problem
 

667
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,870
accurate okay and just like the problem
we had uh two PR sessions ago um so the

668
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
we had uh two PR sessions ago um so the
 

669
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,189
we had uh two PR sessions ago um so the
eccentricity is associated with the

670
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:18,199
eccentricity is associated with the
 

671
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,629
eccentricity is associated with the
vertex is sort of like the distance to

672
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:19,639
vertex is sort of like the distance to
 

673
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,269
vertex is sort of like the distance to
the farthest away thing in My Graph and

674
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:22,279
the farthest away thing in My Graph and
 

675
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,949
the farthest away thing in My Graph and
now the radius of My Graph tries to find

676
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:23,959
now the radius of My Graph tries to find
 

677
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,069
now the radius of My Graph tries to find
the most Central vertex which is the

678
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:27,079
the most Central vertex which is the
 

679
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,750
the most Central vertex which is the
minimizer of weighted eccentricity and

680
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
minimizer of weighted eccentricity and
 

681
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,269
minimizer of weighted eccentricity and
we call that the weighted

682
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:34,279

 

683
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,389

radius and so the weighted ah the weight

684
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:37,399
radius and so the weighted ah the weight
 

685
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,710
radius and so the weighted ah the weight
o that's a tough one the weighted

686
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:41,720
o that's a tough one the weighted
 

687
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,110
o that's a tough one the weighted
radius is a measurement uh which is

688
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,120
radius is a measurement uh which is
 

689
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,389
radius is a measurement uh which is
associated not with a Vertex but rather

690
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
associated not with a Vertex but rather
 

691
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,910
associated not with a Vertex but rather
with the graph and it's equal to the Min

692
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
with the graph and it's equal to the Min
 

693
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,069
with the graph and it's equal to the Min
over all possible vertices U of the

694
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
over all possible vertices U of the
 

695
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,949
over all possible vertices U of the
weighted

696
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:55,959
weighted
 

697
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,389
weighted
eccentricity of U okay and so the

698
00:13:59,389 --> 00:13:59,399
eccentricity of U okay and so the
 

699
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,670
eccentricity of U okay and so the
problem here is that we're given a

700
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:00,680
problem here is that we're given a
 

701
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,629
problem here is that we're given a
weighted directed graph with no negative

702
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
weighted directed graph with no negative
 

703
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,629
weighted directed graph with no negative
weight cycle so it may have negative

704
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
weight cycle so it may have negative
 

705
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,990
weight cycle so it may have negative
weights but they can't have a negative

706
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
weights but they can't have a negative
 

707
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,069
weights but they can't have a negative
cycle and the question I touched my face

708
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:09,079
cycle and the question I touched my face
 

709
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,269
cycle and the question I touched my face
uh the question is what is the uh can I

710
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
uh the question is what is the uh can I
 

711
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,829
uh the question is what is the uh can I
find uh the radius of My

712
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:16,839

 

713
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,910

Graph uh in time uh that looks like

714
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:20,920
Graph uh in time uh that looks like
 

715
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,990
Graph uh in time uh that looks like
order mod

716
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,000
order mod
 

717
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,990
order mod
V cubed

718
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
V cubed
 

719
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,749
V cubed
okay now if you recall from our previous

720
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:28,759
okay now if you recall from our previous
 

721
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,990
okay now if you recall from our previous
problem session when we considered

722
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
problem session when we considered
 

723
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,829
problem session when we considered
Computing the radius of a graph what did

724
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:32,839
Computing the radius of a graph what did
 

725
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,629
Computing the radius of a graph what did
we do well we tried to come up with an a

726
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:35,639
we do well we tried to come up with an a
 

727
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,189
we do well we tried to come up with an a
clever algorithm and then we realized

728
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
clever algorithm and then we realized
 

729
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,550
clever algorithm and then we realized
that that was actually kind of

730
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
that that was actually kind of
 

731
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,310
that that was actually kind of
unnecessary that it turned out that the

732
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
unnecessary that it turned out that the
 

733
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,030
unnecessary that it turned out that the
kind of brain dead thing where you

734
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,040
kind of brain dead thing where you
 

735
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,790
kind of brain dead thing where you
just look at the definitions and just

736
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
just look at the definitions and just
 

737
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,470
just look at the definitions and just
make it work uh was actually good enough

738
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,480
make it work uh was actually good enough
 

739
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,749
make it work uh was actually good enough
uh and that actually turns out to be the

740
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:48,759
uh and that actually turns out to be the
 

741
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,629
uh and that actually turns out to be the
case here right this is a good reminder

742
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
case here right this is a good reminder
 

743
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,509
case here right this is a good reminder
for us all that before we go crazy you

744
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
for us all that before we go crazy you
 

745
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,110
for us all that before we go crazy you
know 66 is a fun algorithms class we get

00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,120
know 66 is a fun algorithms class we get
 

747
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,870
know 66 is a fun algorithms class we get
to learn about cute you know references

748
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:57,880
to learn about cute you know references

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,790
to TV shows and and all that um before
we go crazy with that of course if

752
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:01,800
we go crazy with that of course if
 

753
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,110
we go crazy with that of course if
there's an obvious algorithm staring Us

754
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,120
there's an obvious algorithm staring Us
 

755
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,110
there's an obvious algorithm staring Us
in the face to solve a given algorithm's

756
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,120
in the face to solve a given algorithm's
 

757
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,470
in the face to solve a given algorithm's
problem we should try that first before

758
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
problem we should try that first before
 

759
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,749
problem we should try that first before
we try something more clever uh and

760
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:10,759
we try something more clever uh and
 

761
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,670
we try something more clever uh and
indeed in this case uh that

762
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:12,680
indeed in this case uh that
 

763
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,310
indeed in this case uh that
works so what are the sort of

764
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,320
works so what are the sort of
 

765
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,590
works so what are the sort of
ingredients that we need to compute the

766
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
ingredients that we need to compute the
 

767
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,749
ingredients that we need to compute the
radius well the radius is the minimum

768
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:19,759
radius well the radius is the minimum
 

769
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,310
radius well the radius is the minimum
eccentricity so what would be the

770
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:21,320
eccentricity so what would be the
 

771
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,910
eccentricity so what would be the
smartest or the simplest thing to do

772
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:22,920
smartest or the simplest thing to do
 

773
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,550
smartest or the simplest thing to do
rather would be compute the entric for

774
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:25,560
rather would be compute the entric for
 

775
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,309
rather would be compute the entric for
every vertex and take the smallest how

776
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:28,319
every vertex and take the smallest how
 

777
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,910
every vertex and take the smallest how
do I compute the centricity for every

778
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
do I compute the centricity for every
 

779
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,629
do I compute the centricity for every
vertex well I have to have the max

780
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:31,639
vertex well I have to have the max
 

781
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,309
vertex well I have to have the max
distance uh away from that vertex so

782
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:34,319
distance uh away from that vertex so
 

783
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,550
distance uh away from that vertex so
what would be a simple thing to do would

784
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:35,560
what would be a simple thing to do would
 

785
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,350
what would be a simple thing to do would
be to compute distances between all the

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
be to compute distances between all the

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,430
be to compute distances between all the

little confused about the time ordering

792
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
little confused about the time ordering
 

793
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,189

of this class because of the way we're

pair of vertices and that's called
 

801
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,189
pair of vertices and that's called
Johnson's algorithm yeah so if we were

802
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:56,199
Johnson's algorithm yeah so if we were
 

803
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,670
Johnson's algorithm yeah so if we were
to do a totally brain dead version of uh

804
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
to do a totally brain dead version of uh
 

805
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,350
to do a totally brain dead version of uh
solving this problem maybe for

806
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
solving this problem maybe for
 

807
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,430
solving this problem maybe for
convenience the first thing we do is

808
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
convenience the first thing we do is
 

809
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,949
convenience the first thing we do is
compute Delta UV for every possible UV

810
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:05,959
compute Delta UV for every possible UV
 

811
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,829
compute Delta UV for every possible UV
pair and because our graph doesn't have

812
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
pair and because our graph doesn't have
 

813
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,990
pair and because our graph doesn't have
a negative weight cycle we can do that

814
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
a negative weight cycle we can do that
 

815
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,829
a negative weight cycle we can do that
with Johnson's algorithm yeah so step

816
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
with Johnson's algorithm yeah so step
 

817
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,829
with Johnson's algorithm yeah so step
one is to use Johnson's algorithm uh for

818
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
one is to use Johnson's algorithm uh for
 

819
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,269
one is to use Johnson's algorithm uh for
all

820
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:20,279

 

821
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,189

pairs shortest path and I'll uh refer

822
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:24,199
pairs shortest path and I'll uh refer
 

823
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,870
pairs shortest path and I'll uh refer
you guys to the lecture for how to do

824
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:25,880
you guys to the lecture for how to do
 

825
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,829
you guys to the lecture for how to do
that um but the important thing is the

826
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
that um but the important thing is the
 

827
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,990
that um but the important thing is the
runtime of this step of our

828
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
runtime of this step of our
 

829
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,550
runtime of this step of our
algorithm so Johnson's algorithm

830
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
algorithm so Johnson's algorithm
 

831
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,790
algorithm so Johnson's algorithm
generically speaking has v

832
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
generically speaking has v
 

833
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,590
generically speaking has v
e plus

834
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
e plus
 

835
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,790
e plus
v^2 log V hopefully I got that right uh

836
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:43,800
v^2 log V hopefully I got that right uh
 

837
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,509
v^2 log V hopefully I got that right uh
run time and uh what do we know about

838
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
run time and uh what do we know about
 

839
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,309
run time and uh what do we know about
our problem well I believe we're given

840
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:49,319
our problem well I believe we're given
 

841
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:50,990
our problem well I believe we're given
that the graph is

842
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,000
that the graph is
 

843
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,269
that the graph is
connected um and so one thing that we

844
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
connected um and so one thing that we
 

845
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,389
connected um and so one thing that we
can do is notice that e is upper bounded

846
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:55,399
can do is notice that e is upper bounded
 

847
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,949
can do is notice that e is upper bounded
by v^2 I guess even if it's not

848
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
by v^2 I guess even if it's not
 

849
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,990
by v^2 I guess even if it's not
connected I'm sorry that was a dumb

850
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
connected I'm sorry that was a dumb
 

851
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,990
connected I'm sorry that was a dumb
thing to say

852
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,000
thing to say
 

853
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,629
thing to say
just generically speaking our graph is

854
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
just generically speaking our graph is
 

855
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,670
just generically speaking our graph is
is simple so we know that e at most is I

856
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
is simple so we know that e at most is I
 

857
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,990
is simple so we know that e at most is I
guess 2

858
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,000
guess 2
 

859
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,350
guess 2
v^2 which means that this term is upper

860
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
v^2 which means that this term is upper
 

861
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,069
v^2 which means that this term is upper
bounded by V cubed right so we have V

862
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
bounded by V cubed right so we have V
 

863
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,630
bounded by V cubed right so we have V
cubed plus order v^2 log V so at the end

864
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:13,640
cubed plus order v^2 log V so at the end
 

865
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,470
cubed plus order v^2 log V so at the end
of the day the first term wins and we

866
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:15,480
of the day the first term wins and we
 

867
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,549
of the day the first term wins and we
have this is V cubed time notice that

868
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:19,559
have this is V cubed time notice that
 

869
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,110
have this is V cubed time notice that
we're given that budget in the statement

870
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
we're given that budget in the statement
 

871
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,510
we're given that budget in the statement
of our problem so this is perfectly fine

872
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
of our problem so this is perfectly fine
 

873
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,829
of our problem so this is perfectly fine
in other words this is a longwinded way

874
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:24,839
in other words this is a longwinded way
 

875
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,150
in other words this is a longwinded way
of saying it's kosher to compute all

876
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
of saying it's kosher to compute all
 

877
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,029
of saying it's kosher to compute all
pairs shortest path in the constraints

878
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:28,039
pairs shortest path in the constraints
 

879
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,630
pairs shortest path in the constraints
of our our problem here so that's

880
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
of our our problem here so that's
 

881
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,870
of our our problem here so that's
convenient because now in step

882
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:33,880
convenient because now in step
 

883
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,470
convenient because now in step
two well maybe now we just keep you know

884
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:37,480
two well maybe now we just keep you know
 

885
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,549
two well maybe now we just keep you know
we follow we do the the twocan Sam

886
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:39,559
we follow we do the the twocan Sam
 

887
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,789
we follow we do the the twocan Sam
approach again we follow our noses and

888
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:41,799
approach again we follow our noses and
 

889
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,510
approach again we follow our noses and
well now that we have our our pairwise

890
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
well now that we have our our pairwise
 

891
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,390
well now that we have our our pairwise
distances we can now compute the

892
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:45,400
distances we can now compute the
 

893
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,669
distances we can now compute the
eccentricity for every

894
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679

 

895
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,270

vertex for all you just

896
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
vertex for all you just
 

897
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,149
vertex for all you just
directly of course in your homework you

898
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:57,159
directly of course in your homework you
 

899
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,149
directly of course in your homework you
should write out what that means um but

900
00:17:59,149 --> 00:17:59,159
should write out what that means um but
 

901
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,830
should write out what that means um but
here directly just means that for every

902
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:00,840
here directly just means that for every
 

903
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,590
here directly just means that for every
u i Loop over every V and I take

904
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
u i Loop over every V and I take
 

905
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,909
u i Loop over every V and I take
whatever value is

906
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:04,919
whatever value is
 

907
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,710
whatever value is
biggest so notice that I have two Loops

908
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:07,720
biggest so notice that I have two Loops
 

909
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,350
biggest so notice that I have two Loops
one over U one over V so this is order

910
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
one over U one over V so this is order
 

911
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,830
one over U one over V so this is order
mod v^ 2 time so already the first term

912
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
mod v^ 2 time so already the first term
 

913
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,669
mod v^ 2 time so already the first term
is is dominating here so that's that's a

914
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
is is dominating here so that's that's a
 

915
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,950
is is dominating here so that's that's a
good thing I guess uh and then

916
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
good thing I guess uh and then
 

917
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,149
good thing I guess uh and then
finally we have to take the

918
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:26,159

 

919
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:29,549

smallest eccentricity

920
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:29,559
smallest eccentricity
 

921
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,590
smallest eccentricity
of uh any U which just requires one more

922
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:32,600
of uh any U which just requires one more
 

923
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,630
of uh any U which just requires one more
for Loop so this time I I for Loop over

924
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
for Loop so this time I I for Loop over
 

925
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,549
for Loop so this time I I for Loop over
this array and I just take the smallest

926
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
this array and I just take the smallest
 

927
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,149
this array and I just take the smallest
value right so this is just one for Loop

928
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:39,159
value right so this is just one for Loop
 

929
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,870
value right so this is just one for Loop
so that takes order B

930
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:41,880
so that takes order B
 

931
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,149
so that takes order B
time and then we're done right so that's

932
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:44,159
time and then we're done right so that's
 

933
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,630
time and then we're done right so that's
uh our our technique for computing the

934
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:45,640
uh our our technique for computing the
 

935
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,029
uh our our technique for computing the
radius and notice that all I did was

936
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:48,039
radius and notice that all I did was
 

937
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,350
radius and notice that all I did was
translate the definition into an

938
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360
translate the definition into an
 

939
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,990
translate the definition into an
algorithm I didn't do anything smart in

940
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
algorithm I didn't do anything smart in
 

941
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,149
algorithm I didn't do anything smart in
this problem at all uh and then we

942
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:54,159
this problem at all uh and then we
 

943
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,430
this problem at all uh and then we
should really quickly double check our

944
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
should really quickly double check our
 

945
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,950
should really quickly double check our
run time so step one take V Cube time

946
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:57,960
run time so step one take V Cube time
 

947
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,990
run time so step one take V Cube time
step two two takes v^2 time step three

948
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
step two two takes v^2 time step three
 

949
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,149
step two two takes v^2 time step three
takes V time so we add them all together

950
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:02,159
takes V time so we add them all together
 

951
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:04,230
takes V time so we add them all together
and of course the V cubed wins uh and

952
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
and of course the V cubed wins uh and
 

953
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,630
and of course the V cubed wins uh and
that is what was given in our uh our

954
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
that is what was given in our uh our
 

955
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,430
that is what was given in our uh our
problem as our our

956
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:08,440
problem as our our
 

957
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,430
problem as our our
budget okay so I think the first two

958
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,440
budget okay so I think the first two
 

959
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,110
budget okay so I think the first two
problems in this uh this this problem

960
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,120
problems in this uh this this problem
 

961
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,549
problems in this uh this this problem
session are fairly straightforward are

962
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:13,559
session are fairly straightforward are

session are fairly straightforward are
there any questions so far I'm talking

964
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,080
there any questions so far I'm talking
 

965
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,590
there any questions so far I'm talking
fast cool all right so now we're going

966
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:20,600
fast cool all right so now we're going
 

967
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,350
fast cool all right so now we're going
to move on to problem three involving

yeah so before I get carried away trying

980
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:44,600
yeah so before I get carried away trying
 

981
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,470
yeah so before I get carried away trying
to read Jason's uh jokes here um what's

982
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:47,480
to read Jason's uh jokes here um what's
 

983
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,310
to read Jason's uh jokes here um what's
going on in this problem so this is

984
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
going on in this problem so this is
 

985
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,710
going on in this problem so this is
problem three there's an underground

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,230
have written this problem about MIT
right there's all kinds of crazy

992
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240
right there's all kinds of crazy
 

993
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,750
right there's all kinds of crazy
underground tunnels here

994

uh I remember when I was looking at MIT

996
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
uh I remember when I was looking at MIT
 

997
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,190
uh I remember when I was looking at MIT
as a potential undergrad I they had us

998
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
as a potential undergrad I they had us
 

999
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,149
as a potential undergrad I they had us
like slepping around in the tunnels and

1000
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:05,159
like slepping around in the tunnels and
 

1001
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:06,669
like slepping around in the tunnels and
I thought they were very dirty and I

I thought they were very dirty and I
 

1003
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:07,990
I thought they were very dirty and I
didn't get the point so I went to

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
didn't get the point so I went to
 

1005
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,430
didn't get the point so I went to

in our last problem session every time
 

1035
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,310
in our last problem session every time
you see a phrase like that it's like

pipe um so it's starting to smell like a

1052
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
pipe um so it's starting to smell like a
 

1053
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,909
pipe um so it's starting to smell like a
shortest path problem but is it that's

1054
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
shortest path problem but is it that's
 

1055
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,710
shortest path problem but is it that's
our question uh but just to make things

is trying to escape through the uh pipes

1060
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:33,720
is trying to escape through the uh pipes
 

1061
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,149
is trying to escape through the uh pipes
and she doesn't want to be detected and

1062
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
and she doesn't want to be detected and
 

1063
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,590
and she doesn't want to be detected and
in particular there exist

1064
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:40,600

 

1065
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,350

Junctions with uh motion

1066
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,360

 

1067
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,390

sensors and apparently atn's uh Intel is

1068
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:49,400
sensors and apparently atn's uh Intel is
 

1069
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,430
sensors and apparently atn's uh Intel is
pretty good here and she knows which of

1070
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
pretty good here and she knows which of
 

1071
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,269
pretty good here and she knows which of
the Junctions in her pipe network uh

1072
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:54,279
the Junctions in her pipe network uh
 

1073
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,510
the Junctions in her pipe network uh
actually have a motion sensor sensors uh

1074
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
actually have a motion sensor sensors uh
 

1075
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,830
actually have a motion sensor sensors uh
that

1076
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:58,840
that
 

1077
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,390
that
um that can detect people moving around

1078
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
um that can detect people moving around
 

1079
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,269
um that can detect people moving around
okay um now what this problem is asking

1080
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:05,279
okay um now what this problem is asking
 

1081
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,590
okay um now what this problem is asking
her to do is to say like maybe

1082
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
her to do is to say like maybe
 

1083
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,789
her to do is to say like maybe
apparently she knows where the motion

1084
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799
apparently she knows where the motion
 

1085
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,190
apparently she knows where the motion
sensors are but maybe she doesn't know

1086
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,200
sensors are but maybe she doesn't know
 

1087
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,029
sensors are but maybe she doesn't know
if they're like you know what kind of

1088
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:12,039
if they're like you know what kind of
 

1089
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,190
if they're like you know what kind of
brand they are you know is it a

1090
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
brand they are you know is it a
 

1091
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,669
brand they are you know is it a
Microsoft sensor or a apple sensor or

1092
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
Microsoft sensor or a apple sensor or
 

1093
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,990
Microsoft sensor or a apple sensor or
something and of course the sensors have

1094
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,000
something and of course the sensors have
 

1095
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,149
something and of course the sensors have
different ranges right so so atus kevine

1096
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
different ranges right so so atus kevine
 

1097
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,510
different ranges right so so atus kevine
here she wants to be as conservative as

1098
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:22,520
here she wants to be as conservative as
 

1099
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,110
here she wants to be as conservative as
possible when she traverses this pipe

1100
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
possible when she traverses this pipe
 

1101
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,350
possible when she traverses this pipe
Network in particular what we looking

1102
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,360
Network in particular what we looking
 

1103
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,750
Network in particular what we looking
for what she

1104
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
for what she
 

1105
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,269
for what she
wants is uh in uh n log n time

1106
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:37,279

 

1107
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:43,350

here find the PATH um that

1108
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
here find the PATH um that
 

1109
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:52,190
here find the PATH um that
maximizes uh the distance to the

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:52,200

 

1111
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,310

sensors so hopefully this problem makes

1112
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
sensors so hopefully this problem makes
 

1113
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,269
sensors so hopefully this problem makes
sense so you've got some you know grid

1114
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:57,279
sense so you've got some you know grid
 

1115
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,990
sense so you've got some you know grid
graph well not necessarily a grid graph

1116
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,000
graph well not necessarily a grid graph
 

1117
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,149
graph well not necessarily a grid graph
but the a bunch of vertices of veilance

1118
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:01,159
but the a bunch of vertices of veilance
 

1119
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,590
but the a bunch of vertices of veilance
4 maybe something like that you know

1120
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:03,600
4 maybe something like that you know
 

1121
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,029
4 maybe something like that you know
makes sense you know she's living in a

1122
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039
makes sense you know she's living in a
 

1123
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,070
makes sense you know she's living in a
city somewhere uh and she has some

1124
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,080
city somewhere uh and she has some
 

1125
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,950
city somewhere uh and she has some
source that she's starting at some

1126
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
source that she's starting at some
 

1127
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,430
source that she's starting at some
destination she wants to go and then a

1128
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
destination she wants to go and then a
 

1129
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,909
destination she wants to go and then a
few of these

1130
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:12,919
few of these
 

1131
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,310
few of these
vertices are marked as having motion

1132
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,320
vertices are marked as having motion
 

1133
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,510
vertices are marked as having motion
sensors at them and rather than like

1134
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
sensors at them and rather than like
 

1135
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,909
sensors at them and rather than like
giving you a radius or something like

1136
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:20,919
giving you a radius or something like
 

1137
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:22,870
giving you a radius or something like
that instead what we're saying is that

1138
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
that instead what we're saying is that
 

1139
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,750
that instead what we're saying is that
she wants to go from the source to the

1140
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:24,760
she wants to go from the source to the
 

1141
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,390
she wants to go from the source to the
Target she's willing to walk a long

1142
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
Target she's willing to walk a long
 

1143
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,630
Target she's willing to walk a long
distance the length of the path doesn't

1144
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:27,640
distance the length of the path doesn't
 

1145
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,470
distance the length of the path doesn't
matter

1146
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
matter
 

1147
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,070
matter
what matters is that she never wants to

1148
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,080
what matters is that she never wants to
 

1149
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,669
what matters is that she never wants to
get closer to any motion sensor maybe

1150
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
get closer to any motion sensor maybe
 

1151
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,990
get closer to any motion sensor maybe
there's a second one like here then she

1152
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
there's a second one like here then she
 

1153
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,149
there's a second one like here then she
has to okay so like in this case I guess

1154
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:39,159
has to okay so like in this case I guess
 

1155
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,430
has to okay so like in this case I guess
if I were to eyeball it looks like you

1156
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
if I were to eyeball it looks like you
 

1157
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,909
if I were to eyeball it looks like you
can't do better than one Edge right so

1158
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:42,919
can't do better than one Edge right so
 

1159
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,230
can't do better than one Edge right so
she would go like that uh and of course

1160
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:47,240
she would go like that uh and of course
 

1161
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,669
she would go like that uh and of course
uh in an extreme scenario it might be

1162
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:48,679
uh in an extreme scenario it might be
 

1163
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,230
uh in an extreme scenario it might be
the case that like there's a sensor at

1164
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
the case that like there's a sensor at
 

1165
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,789
the case that like there's a sensor at
every Junction in which case she's uh

1166
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
every Junction in which case she's uh
 

1167
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,510
every Junction in which case she's uh
hosed um but she we'd like to let her

1168
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
hosed um but she we'd like to let her
 

1169
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,630
hosed um but she we'd like to let her
know that before she uh embarks upon her

1170
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:57,640
know that before she uh embarks upon her
 

1171
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,630
know that before she uh embarks upon her
J here okay so does our our problem make

1172
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
J here okay so does our our problem make
 

1173
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,430
J here okay so does our our problem make
enough

1174
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
enough

sense excellent um okay so right so

1176
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,240
sense excellent um okay so right so
 

1177
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,230

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:09,240
unfortunately for
 

1179
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,710
unfortunately for
us this isn't again it doesn't look like

1180
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:11,720
us this isn't again it doesn't look like
 

1181
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,269
us this isn't again it doesn't look like
a shortest path problem and the reason

1182
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
a shortest path problem and the reason
 

1183
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,830
a shortest path problem and the reason
is cuz you know it's it's not uh but

1184
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:16,840
is cuz you know it's it's not uh but
 

1185
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,230
is cuz you know it's it's not uh but
rather uh it's sort of a reachability

1186
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,240
rather uh it's sort of a reachability
 

1187
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,590
rather uh it's sort of a reachability
problem in Disguise and and let's think

1188
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
problem in Disguise and and let's think
 

1189
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,269
problem in Disguise and and let's think
about what I mean here so

1190
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
about what I mean here so
 

1191
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,590
about what I mean here so
um right so there's an obvious graph

1192
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
um right so there's an obvious graph
 

1193
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,350
um right so there's an obvious graph
here

1194
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,360
here
 

1195
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,269
here
we'll call it g out of a lack of

1196
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279

 

1197
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,029

creativity um where what I'm going to do

1198
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:36,039
creativity um where what I'm going to do
 

1199
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,789
creativity um where what I'm going to do
is uh give a

1200
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:38,799
is uh give a
 

1201
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,310
is uh give a
Vertex per

1202
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320

 

1203
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,430

Junction and uh I'll have an undirected

1204
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:48,440

 

1205
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,230

edge for each

1206
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,240
edge for each
 

1207
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,750
edge for each
pipe um whose weight is the

1208
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:56,760

 

1209
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,630

length

1210
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640

 

1211
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,350

okay by the way I think the length I

1212
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:02,360
okay by the way I think the length I
 

1213
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,470
okay by the way I think the length I
didn't even mention in the problem

1214
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,480
didn't even mention in the problem
 

1215
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,110
didn't even mention in the problem
description but I

1216
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,120
description but I
 

1217
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,669
description but I
believe she wants to find the shortest

1218
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
believe she wants to find the shortest
 

1219
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,389
believe she wants to find the shortest
path that maximizes the radius so like

1220
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:10,399
path that maximizes the radius so like
 

1221
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:11,470
path that maximizes the radius so like
if there are like multiple different

1222
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:11,480
if there are like multiple different
 

1223
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,029
if there are like multiple different
paths that she could take that both have

1224
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
paths that she could take that both have
 

1225
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,669
paths that she could take that both have
the same radius from the sensors then

1226
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:14,679
the same radius from the sensors then
 

1227
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,230
the same radius from the sensors then
she'd like to be lazy and not walk too

1228
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
she'd like to be lazy and not walk too
 

1229
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,389
she'd like to be lazy and not walk too
far so that's that's where this going to

1230
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:17,399
far so that's that's where this going to
 

1231
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,950
far so that's that's where this going to
come into play okay um that's sort of a

1232
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:19,960
come into play okay um that's sort of a
 

1233
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,029
come into play okay um that's sort of a
secondary concern I would imagine on

1234
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:22,039
secondary concern I would imagine on
 

1235
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:27,269
secondary concern I would imagine on
adn's behalf here okay and moreover uh

1236
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
adn's behalf here okay and moreover uh
 

1237
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,830
adn's behalf here okay and moreover uh
I'm not even attempt to remember the the

1238
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
I'm not even attempt to remember the the
 

1239
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,710
I'm not even attempt to remember the the
details of this problem but but rather

1240
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:31,720
details of this problem but but rather
 

1241
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,029
details of this problem but but rather
there's a source which I'm sure has some

1242
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:34,039
there's a source which I'm sure has some
 

1243
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,510
there's a source which I'm sure has some
cute Hunger Games uh name attached to it

1244
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
cute Hunger Games uh name attached to it
 

1245
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,950
cute Hunger Games uh name attached to it
and some other Target

1246
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
and some other Target
 

1247
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,430
and some other Target
um and these are just two nodes in the

1248
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
um and these are just two nodes in the
 

1249
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,149
um and these are just two nodes in the
uh the network of pipes and she wants a

1250
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:45,159
uh the network of pipes and she wants a
 

1251
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:47,029
uh the network of pipes and she wants a
path from s to

1252
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:47,039
path from s to
 

1253
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,710
path from s to
T okay so first of all uh let's just

1254
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:49,720
T okay so first of all uh let's just
 

1255
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,029
T okay so first of all uh let's just
count um and make sure that we know uh

1256
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:52,039
count um and make sure that we know uh
 

1257
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,630
count um and make sure that we know uh
so there's uh how many vertices are

1258
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
so there's uh how many vertices are
 

1259
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,870
so there's uh how many vertices are
there well the problem actually gives a

1260
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:55,880
there well the problem actually gives a
 

1261
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,029
there well the problem actually gives a
name to that there's order n

1262
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
name to that there's order n
 

1263
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,190
name to that there's order n
vertices because that's just the number

1264
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
vertices because that's just the number
 

1265
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,750
vertices because that's just the number
of Junctions which is what we Define to

1266
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:02,760
of Junctions which is what we Define to
 

1267
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,510
of Junctions which is what we Define to
be n guess I forgot to write that there

1268
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
be n guess I forgot to write that there
 

1269
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,870
be n guess I forgot to write that there
uh and because we have a degree bound uh

1270
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:07,880
uh and because we have a degree bound uh
 

1271
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,230
uh and because we have a degree bound uh
our favorite argument uh in this class

1272
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240
our favorite argument uh in this class
 

1273
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,350
our favorite argument uh in this class
uh we know that there's order and

1274
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:14,360

 

1275
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,710

edges as well so that's that's good

1276
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
edges as well so that's that's good
 

1277
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,310
edges as well so that's that's good
news why can't I use this graph directly

1278
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,320
news why can't I use this graph directly
 

1279
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,870
news why can't I use this graph directly
like like let's say that I computed the

1280
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
like like let's say that I computed the
 

1281
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,430
like like let's say that I computed the
shortest path from s to T notice that

1282
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
shortest path from s to T notice that
 

1283
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,310
shortest path from s to T notice that
that completely ignores the point of the

1284
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,320
that completely ignores the point of the
 

1285
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,510
that completely ignores the point of the
problem right the the point of the

1286
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:28,520
problem right the the point of the
 

1287
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,350
problem right the the point of the
problem is that uh atus wants to avoid

1288
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
problem is that uh atus wants to avoid
 

1289
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,269
problem is that uh atus wants to avoid
these starred vertices on our graph up

1290
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
these starred vertices on our graph up
 

1291
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,909
these starred vertices on our graph up
here but the shortest path may not do

1292
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:35,919
here but the shortest path may not do
 

1293
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,389
here but the shortest path may not do
that in other words she may have to walk

1294
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:37,399
that in other words she may have to walk
 

1295
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:39,470
that in other words she may have to walk
like a really indirect path to avoid

1296
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:39,480
like a really indirect path to avoid
 

1297
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,230
like a really indirect path to avoid
being detected by the

1298
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,240
being detected by the
 

1299
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,230
being detected by the
sensors that's the problem so we need to

1300
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
sensors that's the problem so we need to
 

1301
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,789
sensors that's the problem so we need to
be a little more clever than that we do

1302
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:45,799
be a little more clever than that we do
 

1303
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,310
be a little more clever than that we do
have to think on this problem a bit okay

1304
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
have to think on this problem a bit okay
 

1305
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,510
have to think on this problem a bit okay
but not too much uh and so here's the

1306
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:50,520
but not too much uh and so here's the
 

1307
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,430
but not too much uh and so here's the
basic trick like let's say that let's

1308
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
basic trick like let's say that let's
 

1309
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,070
basic trick like let's say that let's
solve a slightly different problem first

1310
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,080
solve a slightly different problem first
 

1311
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,549
solve a slightly different problem first
which is let's say that I give you a

1312
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
which is let's say that I give you a
 

1313
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,549
which is let's say that I give you a
radius k and I want to know does there

1314
00:26:59,549 --> 00:26:59,559
radius k and I want to know does there
 

1315
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,230
radius k and I want to know does there
exist a path that can get me from s to T

1316
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,240
exist a path that can get me from s to T
 

1317
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,950
exist a path that can get me from s to T
without coming more than distance K away

1318
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:05,960
without coming more than distance K away
 

1319
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,350
without coming more than distance K away
from the

1320
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,360
from the
 

1321
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,350
from the
sensors notice that once I if I have a

1322
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
sensors notice that once I if I have a
 

1323
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,950
sensors notice that once I if I have a
tool that can answer that like yes or no

1324
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
tool that can answer that like yes or no
 

1325
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,230
tool that can answer that like yes or no
problem I could come up with an

1326
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
problem I could come up with an
 

1327
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,389
problem I could come up with an
algorithm that that finds my number of

1328
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:14,399
algorithm that that finds my number of
 

1329
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,750
algorithm that that finds my number of
sensors by like looping over k or

1330
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:15,760
sensors by like looping over k or
 

1331
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,590
sensors by like looping over k or
something it may not be fast enough but

1332
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
something it may not be fast enough but
 

1333
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,310
something it may not be fast enough but
I could do that okay so that problem is

1334
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,320
I could do that okay so that problem is
 

1335
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,029
I could do that okay so that problem is
actually not terribly difficult because

1336
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
actually not terribly difficult because
 

1337
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,590
actually not terribly difficult because
essentially what I could do conceptually

1338
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
essentially what I could do conceptually
 

1339
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,549
essentially what I could do conceptually
is just remove the vertices that are too

1340
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:27,559
is just remove the vertices that are too
 

1341
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,830
is just remove the vertices that are too
close to the sensors and then solve a

1342
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:29,840
close to the sensors and then solve a
 

1343
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,430
close to the sensors and then solve a
reachability problem like can I get from

1344
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
reachability problem like can I get from
 

1345
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,470
reachability problem like can I get from
s to T without getting distance K away

1346
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
s to T without getting distance K away
 

1347
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,669
s to T without getting distance K away
from any one of the sensors well what do

1348
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:36,679
from any one of the sensors well what do
 

1349
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,350
from any one of the sensors well what do
I do I just remove any vertex that's

1350
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,360
I do I just remove any vertex that's
 

1351
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,830
I do I just remove any vertex that's
distance K away from the sensors and

1352
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:39,840
distance K away from the sensors and
 

1353
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,909
distance K away from the sensors and
then I compute reachability so so

1354
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
then I compute reachability so so
 

1355
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,230
then I compute reachability so so
conceptually I think this isn't a huge

1356
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
conceptually I think this isn't a huge
 

1357
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,470
conceptually I think this isn't a huge
leap intuitively uh speaking but there's

1358
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
leap intuitively uh speaking but there's
 

1359
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,430
leap intuitively uh speaking but there's
a lot of details to fill in yeah so

1360
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
a lot of details to fill in yeah so
 

1361
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,350
a lot of details to fill in yeah so
unraveling just a little bit

00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:29,559
essentially it's pretty clear what it is
 

1387
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,070
essentially it's pretty clear what it is
just from the the word right like

larger graph and any edges that touch
 

1395
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,590

okay well we already covered a trick uh

1430
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
okay well we already covered a trick uh
 

1431
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,789
okay well we already covered a trick uh
in our problem sessions so it's going to

1432
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
in our problem sessions so it's going to

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,350
in our problem sessions so it's going to
help us do that right

1434
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,360
help us do that right
 

1435
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,350
help us do that right
because okay what would be a very simple

1436
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,360
because okay what would be a very simple
 

1437
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,430
because okay what would be a very simple
algorithm for doing that would be to

00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
algorithm for doing that would be to
 

1439
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,190
algorithm for doing that would be to

00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
algorithm for each one right so that
 

1443
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,990
algorithm for each one right so that
gives me the the distance to sensor

1444
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,000
gives me the the distance to sensor
 

1445
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,669
gives me the the distance to sensor
number one and the distance to sensor

1446
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:33,679
number one and the distance to sensor
 

1447
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,269
number one and the distance to sensor
number two the distance to sensor number

1448
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
number two the distance to sensor number
 

1449
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,590
number two the distance to sensor number
three and I take the men over all those

1450
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,600
three and I take the men over all those
 

1451
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,870
three and I take the men over all those
and that function gives me the distance

1452
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
and that function gives me the distance
 

1453
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,990
and that function gives me the distance
to any sensor that's going to be a

1454
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,000
to any sensor that's going to be a
 

1455
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,389
to any sensor that's going to be a
problem right because Dao's algorithm

1456
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:42,399
problem right because Dao's algorithm
 

1457
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,590
problem right because Dao's algorithm
runs in N log n time but now I've

1458
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:44,600
runs in N log n time but now I've
 

1459
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,110
runs in N log n time but now I've
incurred another Factor because I have

1460
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,120
incurred another Factor because I have
 

1461
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,950
incurred another Factor because I have
to Loop over all the sensors and we

1462
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:47,960
to Loop over all the sensors and we
 

1463
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,269
to Loop over all the sensors and we
didn't give you a bound on how many

1464
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:49,279
didn't give you a bound on how many
 

1465
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,389
didn't give you a bound on how many
there

1466
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
there
 

1467
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,710
there
are so more generically this is actually

1468
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
are so more generically this is actually
 

1469
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,389
are so more generically this is actually
a problem that shows up all the time uh

1470
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
a problem that shows up all the time uh
 

1471
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,269
a problem that shows up all the time uh
in my everyday life which is that like

1472
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:56,279
in my everyday life which is that like
 

1473
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,909
in my everyday life which is that like
we don't just want comput shortest path

1474
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919
we don't just want comput shortest path
 

1475
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,190
we don't just want comput shortest path
to a single point sometimes you want

1476
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
to a single point sometimes you want
 

1477
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,350
to a single point sometimes you want
shortest path to a bunch of stuff like

1478
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,360
shortest path to a bunch of stuff like
 

1479
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,110
shortest path to a bunch of stuff like
in other words I don't care which sensor

1480
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
in other words I don't care which sensor
 

1481
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,549
in other words I don't care which sensor
is close to me I don't want to get close

1482
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
is close to me I don't want to get close
 

1483
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,230
is close to me I don't want to get close
to any sensor yeah uh this shows up in

1484
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
to any sensor yeah uh this shows up in
 

1485
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,669
to any sensor yeah uh this shows up in
Geometry all the time like maybe I want

1486
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:09,679
Geometry all the time like maybe I want
 

1487
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,590
Geometry all the time like maybe I want
to know the closest you know like I want

1488
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:11,600
to know the closest you know like I want
 

1489
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,509
to know the closest you know like I want
to find the closest point on the highway

1490
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:13,519
to find the closest point on the highway
 

1491
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,590
to find the closest point on the highway
you know so the highway is driving past

1492
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
you know so the highway is driving past
 

1493
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,149
you know so the highway is driving past
uh my house so the highway is a whole

1494
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:17,159
uh my house so the highway is a whole
 

1495
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,190
uh my house so the highway is a whole
bunch of points on some Network and I

1496
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
bunch of points on some Network and I
 

1497
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,710
bunch of points on some Network and I
just want to get on the highway and

1498
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
just want to get on the highway and
 

1499
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,269
just want to get on the highway and
start driving um I don't care about the

1500
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
start driving um I don't care about the
 

1501
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,669
start driving um I don't care about the
closest path to every single point on

1502
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
closest path to every single point on
 

1503
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,430
closest path to every single point on
the highway I just want the whatever

1504
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,440
the highway I just want the whatever
 

1505
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,110
the highway I just want the whatever
closest to me right so this is a pretty

1506
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
closest to me right so this is a pretty
 

1507
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,310
closest to me right so this is a pretty
practical thing to think about so how do

1508
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,320
practical thing to think about so how do
 

1509
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,230
practical thing to think about so how do
we solve that so um let's say this is

1510
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,240
we solve that so um let's say this is
 

1511
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,590
we solve that so um let's say this is
our pipe

1512
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
our pipe
 

1513
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,669
our pipe
Network I feel like I draw this network

1514
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:37,679
Network I feel like I draw this network
 

1515
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,430
Network I feel like I draw this network
a lot maybe I'll spice it up with an

1516
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,440
a lot maybe I'll spice it up with an
 

1517
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,509
a lot maybe I'll spice it up with an
extra Edge okay and maybe uh for board

1518
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:45,519
extra Edge okay and maybe uh for board
 

1519
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,430
extra Edge okay and maybe uh for board
drawing purposes these two vertices have

1520
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
drawing purposes these two vertices have
 

1521
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,029
drawing purposes these two vertices have
sensors so I'm trying to find the

1522
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:52,039
sensors so I'm trying to find the
 

1523
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,310
sensors so I'm trying to find the
shortest path distance to either one of

1524
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,320
shortest path distance to either one of
 

1525
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,110
shortest path distance to either one of
these two vertices uh from every other

1526
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,120
these two vertices uh from every other
 

1527
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,070
these two vertices uh from every other
vertex on the graph or vice versa it

1528
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,080
vertex on the graph or vice versa it
 

1529
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,310
vertex on the graph or vice versa it
doesn't matter it's

1530
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,320
doesn't matter it's
 

1531
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,470
doesn't matter it's
undirected um and I don't want to Loop

1532
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
undirected um and I don't want to Loop
 

1533
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,870
undirected um and I don't want to Loop
over all these sensors that's the basic

1534
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:05,880
over all these sensors that's the basic
 

1535
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,909
over all these sensors that's the basic
headache here so one thing that I can do

1536
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:08,919
headache here so one thing that I can do
 

1537
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:10,549
headache here so one thing that I can do
is it's kind of a sneaky trick and it's

1538
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
is it's kind of a sneaky trick and it's
 

1539
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,669
is it's kind of a sneaky trick and it's
exactly the same trick that we've

1540
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:11,679
exactly the same trick that we've
 

1541
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,070
exactly the same trick that we've
applied a few times in in the problem

1542
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,080
applied a few times in in the problem
 

1543
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,629
applied a few times in in the problem
sessions here is to add a new vertex

1544
00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:17,639
sessions here is to add a new vertex
 

1545
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:18,990
sessions here is to add a new vertex
that's kind of like a

1546
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,000
that's kind of like a
 

1547
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,669
that's kind of like a
source and make that vertex distance

1548
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
source and make that vertex distance
 

1549
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,149
source and make that vertex distance
zero to every one of my

1550
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
zero to every one of my
 

1551
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,310
zero to every one of my
sensors and now what I'm going to do is

1552
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,320
sensors and now what I'm going to do is
 

1553
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,950
sensors and now what I'm going to do is
do single Source shortest path from this

1554
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:31,960
do single Source shortest path from this
 

1555
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,509
do single Source shortest path from this

00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,190
Rest of My
Graph now why do I do that well if you

1560
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:38,200
Graph now why do I do that well if you
 

1561
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,070
Graph now why do I do that well if you
think about it well there's an edge of

1562
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
think about it well there's an edge of
 

1563
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,830
think about it well there's an edge of
length zero to any sens sensor

1564
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:42,840
length zero to any sens sensor
 

1565
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,350
length zero to any sens sensor
topologically I can think of it like I

1566
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:44,360
topologically I can think of it like I
 

1567
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,269
topologically I can think of it like I
glued all the sensors into one vertex if

1568
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:46,279
glued all the sensors into one vertex if
 

1569
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,110
glued all the sensors into one vertex if
I wanted but that doesn't really matter

1570
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,120
I wanted but that doesn't really matter
 

1571
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,950
I wanted but that doesn't really matter
um fact that would be a different way to

1572
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:51,960
um fact that would be a different way to
 

1573
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,149
um fact that would be a different way to
solve this problem I guess would be to

1574
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:53,159
solve this problem I guess would be to
 

1575
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,669
solve this problem I guess would be to
take all the the sensor vertices glue

1576
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:54,679
take all the the sensor vertices glue
 

1577
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,029
take all the the sensor vertices glue
them together into one and then solve

1578
00:31:56,029 --> 00:31:56,039
them together into one and then solve
 

1579
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,509
them together into one and then solve
this problem but I digress um right so

1580
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:00,519
this problem but I digress um right so
 

1581
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,110
this problem but I digress um right so
the the shortest path distance from our

1582
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,120
the the shortest path distance from our
 

1583
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,149
the the shortest path distance from our
new uh Source vertex all the other ones

1584
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:04,159
new uh Source vertex all the other ones
 

1585
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,710
new uh Source vertex all the other ones
is going to be just the shortest path to

1586
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:05,720
is going to be just the shortest path to
 

1587
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,269
is going to be just the shortest path to
any sensor because notice that any path

1588
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:08,279
any sensor because notice that any path
 

1589
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,350
any sensor because notice that any path
coming out of s necessarily has to pass

1590
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,360
coming out of s necessarily has to pass
 

1591
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,269
coming out of s necessarily has to pass
through a starred vertex okay so let's

1592
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:12,279
through a starred vertex okay so let's
 

1593
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:15,070
through a starred vertex okay so let's
write that down um basically uh what I'm

1594
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,080
write that down um basically uh what I'm
 

1595
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,029
write that down um basically uh what I'm
trying to do here is uh in step one of

1596
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:18,039
trying to do here is uh in step one of
 

1597
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,310
trying to do here is uh in step one of
my algorithm I want to

1598

of the last two problems um which you
 

1657
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,110

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:05,480
is all the information that I can gather
 

1675
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,310
is all the information that I can gather
out of my graph in nlog and time and I

1676
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,320
out of my graph in nlog and time and I
 

1677
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,190
out of my graph in nlog and time and I
might as well compute it right so for

1678
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
might as well compute it right so for
 

1679
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,389
might as well compute it right so for
instance the distance to the closest

1680
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
instance the distance to the closest

1685
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,829
and algorithm for computing it it seems
like a useful piece of information so

1686
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:16,839
like a useful piece of information so
 

1687
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,310
like a useful piece of information so
what the heck I I might as well compute

what the heck I I might as well compute
 

1689
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,109
what the heck I I might as well compute
it in step one and just have it around

1695
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,710

this might not be the most efficient way

this might not be the most efficient way
 

1697
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,389
this might not be the most efficient way

1703
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:33,109

worth kind of going down your checklist

1704
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
worth kind of going down your checklist
 

1705
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,470

like similarly here notice that like we
gave you a budget of of VCB time so like

1708
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:38,679
gave you a budget of of VCB time so like
 

1709
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,109

aren't right because I can just Loop
 

1747
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,109

construct GK from our original graph G
 

1759
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,349
construct GK from our original graph G
um and that's really easy to do right

1760
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:40,359
um and that's really easy to do right
 

1761
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:45,470
um and that's really easy to do right
just by looping over the

1762
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:45,480

 

1763
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,349

vertices and

1764
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:49,359
vertices and
 

1765
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,230
vertices and
remove any uh whose distance is too big

1766
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:53,240
remove any uh whose distance is too big
 

1767
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,790
remove any uh whose distance is too big
or too small

1768
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:55,800
or too small
 

1769
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,790
or too small
rather

1770
00:35:59,790 --> 00:35:59,800

 

1771
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,870

uh

1772
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880

 

1773
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,870

V that make sense because those are the

1774
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
V that make sense because those are the
 

1775
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,990
V that make sense because those are the
ones that are are dangerous if like the

1776
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,000
ones that are are dangerous if like the
 

1777
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,870
ones that are are dangerous if like the
radius of my sensor is K any vertex with

1778
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:09,880
radius of my sensor is K any vertex with
 

1779
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,150
radius of my sensor is K any vertex with
this is less than equal to K I want to

1780
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,160
this is less than equal to K I want to
 

1781
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,430
this is less than equal to K I want to
throw away um and how much time does

1782
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,440
throw away um and how much time does
 

1783
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,710
throw away um and how much time does
this take well there's just a loop over

1784
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
this take well there's just a loop over
 

1785
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,589
this take well there's just a loop over
the vertices I guess I need to account

1786
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:16,599
the vertices I guess I need to account
 

1787
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,990
the vertices I guess I need to account
for the storage of My Graph also but of

1788
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,000
for the storage of My Graph also but of
 

1789
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,589
for the storage of My Graph also but of
course this graph takes less space than

1790
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
course this graph takes less space than
 

1791
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,109
course this graph takes less space than
G and so overall uh this takes order n

1792
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:26,119
G and so overall uh this takes order n
 

1793
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,349
G and so overall uh this takes order n

00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:33,680

ever asked Jason one question which is

1830
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:29,720
ever asked Jason one question which is
 

1831
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,150
ever asked Jason one question which is
you know always has the same answer um

1832
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
you know always has the same answer um
 

1833
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,109
you know always has the same answer um
right so BFS takes time linear in the

1834
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:34,119
right so BFS takes time linear in the
 

1835
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,710
right so BFS takes time linear in the
size of our graph our graph has size n

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,440
or kind of 2 Nish uh so at the end of
 

1839
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,069

1843
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,230

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,470
differently we would be done right if
the problem said you know given a radius

is how we would do that hopefully we all

1854
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:58,920
is how we would do that hopefully we all
 

1855
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,190
is how we would do that hopefully we all
agree and we can do that in order and

that we can stay away from the sensors

1870
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:20,760
that we can stay away from the sensors
 

1871
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,349
that we can stay away from the sensors
uh and still get successfully from s to

1872
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:23,359
uh and still get successfully from s to
 

1873
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,190
uh and still get successfully from s to
T so let's say that I uh want to find

1874
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:26,200
T so let's say that I uh want to find
 

1875
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,790
T so let's say that I uh want to find
this number so this

00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,200
yeah where
 

1899
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,670
yeah where
GK I've just phrased this in a funny

1900
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:03,680

 

1901
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,030

way has path from s to T there we
 

1903
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,390
way has path from s to T there we
go all right so our question is how do

1904
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:13,400
go all right so our question is how do
 

1905
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,430
go all right so our question is how do
we find that well here's a dumb

1906
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,440
we find that well here's a dumb
 

1907
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,150
we find that well here's a dumb
algorithm I could Loop over all

1908
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,160
algorithm I could Loop over all
 

1909
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,550
algorithm I could Loop over all
case construct GK and then if my answer

1910
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:23,560
case construct GK and then if my answer
 

1911
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,630
case construct GK and then if my answer
is yes is reachable then go to the next

1912
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:25,640
is yes is reachable then go to the next
 

1913
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,710
is yes is reachable then go to the next
K increment by one and start over right

1914
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,720
K increment by one and start over right
 

1915
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,230
K increment by one and start over right
so this is the dumb

1916
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
so this is the dumb
 

1917
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,390
so this is the dumb
answer

1918
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
answer
 

1919
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,870
answer
uh when I say dumb I mean the answer

1920
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,880
uh when I say dumb I mean the answer
 

1921
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,510
uh when I say dumb I mean the answer
that your instructor wrote down on his

1922
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:36,520
that your instructor wrote down on his
 

1923
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,950
that your instructor wrote down on his
notes and then realized was done okay uh

1924
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:39,960
notes and then realized was done okay uh
 

1925
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,470
notes and then realized was done okay uh
which is

1926
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:41,480
which is
 

1927
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,190
which is
Loop over K until you get to K star I

1928
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,200
Loop over K until you get to K star I
 

1929
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,030
Loop over K until you get to K star I
guess plus one right because once I get

1930
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,040
guess plus one right because once I get
 

1931
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,270
guess plus one right because once I get
there then I get a thumbs down obviously

1932
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,280
there then I get a thumbs down obviously
 

1933
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,670
there then I get a thumbs down obviously
getting any bigger than that is only

1934
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:52,680
getting any bigger than that is only
 

1935
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,750
getting any bigger than that is only
make my graph smaller this is called a

1936
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:54,760
make my graph smaller this is called a
 

1937
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,750
make my graph smaller this is called a
filtration right because each graph is

1938
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:56,760
filtration right because each graph is
 

1939
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,510
filtration right because each graph is
contained inside of a different one um

1940
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:00,520
contained inside of a different one um
 

1941
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,829
contained inside of a different one um
actually a filtration would be the other

1942
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:02,839
actually a filtration would be the other
 

1943
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,870
actually a filtration would be the other
way I'll think about it for later

1944
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:04,880
way I'll think about it for later
 

1945
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,430
way I'll think about it for later
because this is not a topological data

1946
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:06,440
because this is not a topological data
 

1947
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,910
because this is not a topological data
analysis class uh but in any event um if

1948
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:09,920
analysis class uh but in any event um if
 

1949
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,630
analysis class uh but in any event um if
I did that how much time will it take

1950
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:11,640
I did that how much time will it take
 

1951
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,230
I did that how much time will it take
well remember okay so for one thing I

1952
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240
well remember okay so for one thing I
 

1953
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,150
well remember okay so for one thing I
have n log n from D algorithm I don't

1954
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
have n log n from D algorithm I don't
 

1955
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,309
have n log n from D algorithm I don't
get around

1956
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:17,319
get around
 

1957
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:21,550
get around
that so I always have to account for

1958
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:21,560
that so I always have to account for
 

1959
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,470
that so I always have to account for
that but now every time I try a new k i

1960
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:26,480
that but now every time I try a new k i
 

1961
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,589
that but now every time I try a new k i
incur cost n right that's what we argued

1962
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:28,599
incur cost n right that's what we argued
 

1963
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,910
incur cost n right that's what we argued
up here and so at the end of the day

1964
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:30,920
up here and so at the end of the day
 

1965
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,230
up here and so at the end of the day
this algorithm takes order K

1966
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,240
this algorithm takes order K
 

1967
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,349
this algorithm takes order K
star and time like that of course it's a

1968
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:37,359
star and time like that of course it's a
 

1969
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,030
star and time like that of course it's a
little weird to have the answer of your

1970
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,040
little weird to have the answer of your
 

1971
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,510
little weird to have the answer of your
problem in the runtime but K star here

1972
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:42,520
problem in the runtime but K star here
 

1973
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,270
problem in the runtime but K star here
it could be we don't have any bound here

1974
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:44,280
it could be we don't have any bound here
 

1975
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,750
it could be we don't have any bound here
it could be the the number of vertices

1976
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:45,760
it could be the the number of vertices
 

1977
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,150
it could be the the number of vertices
or or anything like that yeah and so if

1978
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
or or anything like that yeah and so if
 

1979
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,270
or or anything like that yeah and so if
we have a budget of n log n time this

1980
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
we have a budget of n log n time this
 

1981
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,390
we have a budget of n log n time this
doesn't quite work and so the question

1982
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:53,400
doesn't quite work and so the question
 

1983
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,150
doesn't quite work and so the question
is can we rescue this uh this strategy

1984
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,160
is can we rescue this uh this strategy
 

1985
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,630
is can we rescue this uh this strategy
here here and the answer of course is

1986
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:58,640
here here and the answer of course is
 

1987
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,349
here here and the answer of course is
yes or else I wouldn't be standing here

1988
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:00,359
yes or else I wouldn't be standing here
 

1989
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:03,670
yes or else I wouldn't be standing here
today uh one way that you might do that

1990
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:03,680
today uh one way that you might do that
 

1991
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,270
today uh one way that you might do that
so there's the uh way that you would do

1992
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:05,280
so there's the uh way that you would do
 

1993
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,910
so there's the uh way that you would do
that as a real algorithms person and

1994
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:06,920
that as a real algorithms person and
 

1995
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,790
that as a real algorithms person and
there's a way you could do it by

1996
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:07,800
there's a way you could do it by
 

1997
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,190
there's a way you could do it by
psychologically diagnosing your

1998
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,200
psychologically diagnosing your
 

1999
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,990
psychologically diagnosing your
instructors let's let's talk about both

2000
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,000
instructors let's let's talk about both
 

2001
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,430
instructors let's let's talk about both
of those um let's actually do the second

2002
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:13,440
of those um let's actually do the second
 

2003
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,630
of those um let's actually do the second
one first because I think that's the

2004
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
one first because I think that's the
 

2005
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,030
one first because I think that's the
most practical if you want to get your

2006
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,040
most practical if you want to get your
 

2007
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,910
most practical if you want to get your
homework done quickly um which is as

2008
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:18,920
homework done quickly um which is as
 

2009
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,630
homework done quickly um which is as
follows this problem tells you that you

2010
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:20,640
follows this problem tells you that you
 

2011
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,150
follows this problem tells you that you
have an an Logan budget of time uh in

2012
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,160
have an an Logan budget of time uh in
 

2013
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,910
have an an Logan budget of time uh in
order to run the algorithm and so what

2014
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:26,920
order to run the algorithm and so what
 

2015
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,430
order to run the algorithm and so what
does that mean well when we Loop over

2016
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:30,440
does that mean well when we Loop over
 

2017
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,190
does that mean well when we Loop over
potential gks that we can try we have a

2018
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
potential gks that we can try we have a
 

2019
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,470
potential gks that we can try we have a
budget of log and tries before we're

2020
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
budget of log and tries before we're
 

2021
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,630
budget of log and tries before we're
done yeah uh so we kind of know that any

2022
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
done yeah uh so we kind of know that any
 

2023
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,550
done yeah uh so we kind of know that any
algorithm that constructs a GK and tries

2024
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
algorithm that constructs a GK and tries
 

2025
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,750
algorithm that constructs a GK and tries
it can only do it log n times and to my

2026
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:44,760
it can only do it log n times and to my
 

2027
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,030
it can only do it log n times and to my
knowledge we only have one algorithm

2028
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,040
knowledge we only have one algorithm
 

2029
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,550
knowledge we only have one algorithm
that runs in log n time in this class uh

2030
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
that runs in log n time in this class uh
 

2031
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,870
that runs in log n time in this class uh
which is binary search and so we might

2032
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
which is binary search and so we might
 

2033
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,670
which is binary search and so we might
be thinking very critically about how we

2034
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:52,680
be thinking very critically about how we
 

2035
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,349
be thinking very critically about how we
could use that tool but more generally

2036
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:55,359
could use that tool but more generally
 

2037
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,990
could use that tool but more generally
than that I I think this is actually a

2038
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,000
than that I I think this is actually a
 

2039
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,550
than that I I think this is actually a
strategy that shows up a lot both in

2040
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:58,560
strategy that shows up a lot both in
 

2041
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,950
strategy that shows up a lot both in
algorithms and actually numerical

2042
00:41:59,950 --> 00:41:59,960
algorithms and actually numerical
 

2043
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,910
algorithms and actually numerical
analysis a lot uh which is you have some

2044
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:02,920
analysis a lot uh which is you have some
 

2045
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,550
analysis a lot uh which is you have some
like yes or no answer and you want to

2046
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:05,560
like yes or no answer and you want to
 

2047
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,230
like yes or no answer and you want to
find like the point on the interface

2048
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:07,240
find like the point on the interface
 

2049
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,589
find like the point on the interface
right but where yes flips to no and so

2050
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:09,599
right but where yes flips to no and so
 

2051
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,990
right but where yes flips to no and so
one way to do it is to sort of bound it

2052
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,000
one way to do it is to sort of bound it
 

2053
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,790
one way to do it is to sort of bound it
on two NS then keep dividing in half and

2054
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:14,800
on two NS then keep dividing in half and
 

2055
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,589
on two NS then keep dividing in half and
as long as your relationship is a bunch

2056
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:16,599
as long as your relationship is a bunch
 

2057
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,710
as long as your relationship is a bunch
of yeses then a bunch of NOS you can

2058
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
of yeses then a bunch of NOS you can
 

2059
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,549
of yeses then a bunch of NOS you can
keep doing that by binary search right

2060
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:20,559
keep doing that by binary search right
 

2061
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,190
keep doing that by binary search right
so so let's think about it this way so

2062
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,200
so so let's think about it this way so
 

2063
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,589
so so let's think about it this way so
like we have a long

2064
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
like we have a long
 

2065
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,910
like we have a long
interval of K values

2066
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:26,920
interval of K values
 

2067
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,829
interval of K values
by the way obviously there's an upper

2068
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:28,839
by the way obviously there's an upper
 

2069
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,630
by the way obviously there's an upper
bound here which is like the biggest

2070
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
bound here which is like the biggest
 

2071
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,950
bound here which is like the biggest
distance to any vertex in my graph or

2072
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
distance to any vertex in my graph or
 

2073
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,630
distance to any vertex in my graph or
something like that yeah like the sum of

2074
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:35,640
something like that yeah like the sum of
 

2075
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,750
something like that yeah like the sum of
all distances or some large number uh

2076
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:40,760
all distances or some large number uh
 

2077
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,630
all distances or some large number uh
compared

in any event let's say that we have an

in any event let's say that we have an
 

2103
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,990
in any event let's say that we have an
upper Bound for k for now then then what

do we know we know that here's like the

2106
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:16,680
do we know we know that here's like the
 

2107
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,069
do we know we know that here's like the
K star that I

2108
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:18,079
K star that I
 

2109
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,750
K star that I
want and to the left my algorithm will

00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:20,760
want and to the left my algorithm will

here it'll say no right so one thing I

2114
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
here it'll say no right so one thing I
 

2115
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,990
here it'll say no right so one thing I
can do one thing I should do is put K

2116
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
can do one thing I should do is put K
 

2117
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,309
can do one thing I should do is put K

2119
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:33,630

interval um for illustration purposes

2120
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:33,640
interval um for illustration purposes
 

2121
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,950
interval um for illustration purposes
but now I can binary search right

2122
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:34,960
but now I can binary search right
 

2123
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,750
but now I can binary search right
because I could query here and now I'm

2124
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:36,760
because I could query here and now I'm
 

2125
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,670
because I could query here and now I'm
going to get a no and maybe I subdivide

2126
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,680
going to get a no and maybe I subdivide
 

2127
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,190
going to get a no and maybe I subdivide
that the midpoint for some reason now I

2128
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,200
that the midpoint for some reason now I
 

2129
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,790
that the midpoint for some reason now I
get a yes and I can kind of triangulate

2130
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
get a yes and I can kind of triangulate
 

2131
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,150
get a yes and I can kind of triangulate
in on what I want right so that's our

2132
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:45,160
in on what I want right so that's our
 

2133
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,150
in on what I want right so that's our
our basic strategy is binary search here

2134
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,160
our basic strategy is binary search here
 

2135
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,190
our basic strategy is binary search here
um but uh we have to figure out how to

2136
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,200
um but uh we have to figure out how to
 

2137
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,510
um but uh we have to figure out how to
do that

2138
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:52,520
do that
 

2139
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,510
do that
exactly okay so first of all um okay

2140
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:56,520
exactly okay so first of all um okay
 

2141
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,950
exactly okay so first of all um okay
there is an obvious upper bound here

2142
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:57,960
there is an obvious upper bound here
 

2143
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,470
there is an obvious upper bound here
which is just the biggest distance from

2144
00:43:59,470 --> 00:43:59,480
which is just the biggest distance from
 

2145
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,230
which is just the biggest distance from
any vertex to any sensor yeah uh right

2146
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:03,240
any vertex to any sensor yeah uh right
 

2147
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,510
any vertex to any sensor yeah uh right
so we could probably come up with a

2148
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:04,520
so we could probably come up with a
 

2149
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,109
so we could probably come up with a
conservative one we didn't feel like it

2150
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:06,119
conservative one we didn't feel like it
 

2151
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,109
conservative one we didn't feel like it
but um conveniently in step one remember

2152
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:09,119
but um conveniently in step one remember
 

2153
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,670
but um conveniently in step one remember
that Computing convenient numbers is

2154
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:10,680
that Computing convenient numbers is
 

2155
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,870
that Computing convenient numbers is
always a convenient thing to do um

2156
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:12,880
always a convenient thing to do um
 

2157
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,109
always a convenient thing to do um
clearly if Katniss wants to sorry sorry

2158
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:17,119
clearly if Katniss wants to sorry sorry
 

2159
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,069
clearly if Katniss wants to sorry sorry
atus wants to go uh within a radius

2160
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:20,079
atus wants to go uh within a radius
 

2161
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,390
atus wants to go uh within a radius
that's bigger than the distance of any

2162
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:23,400
that's bigger than the distance of any
 

2163
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,390
that's bigger than the distance of any
vertex to any sensor she's in trouble

2164
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:25,400
vertex to any sensor she's in trouble
 

2165
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,829
vertex to any sensor she's in trouble
because like that covers the entire

2166
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:26,839
because like that covers the entire
 

2167
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:31,430
because like that covers the entire
graph yeah so um right so we actually do

2168
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,440
graph yeah so um right so we actually do
 

2169
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,390
graph yeah so um right so we actually do
have a upper bound here which is the

2170
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:36,400

 

2171
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,309

biggest distance to a

2172
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:41,319

 

2173
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,710

sensor and now we want a binary search

2174
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:43,720
sensor and now we want a binary search
 

2175
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,630
sensor and now we want a binary search
but we have to be a little bit careful

2176
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
but we have to be a little bit careful
 

2177
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,230
but we have to be a little bit careful
how to do it because we want it to be

2178
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,240
how to do it because we want it to be
 

2179
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,030
how to do it because we want it to be
logarithmic in N which is like the

2180
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,040
logarithmic in N which is like the
 

2181
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,870
logarithmic in N which is like the
number of vertices in our graph and of

2182
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880
number of vertices in our graph and of
 

2183
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,109
number of vertices in our graph and of
course the way that I've drawn this

2184
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:52,119
course the way that I've drawn this
 

2185
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:54,829
course the way that I've drawn this
interval here uh as Jason points out I I

2186
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:54,839
interval here uh as Jason points out I I
 

2187
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,990
interval here uh as Jason points out I I
don't at least immediately have a bound

2188
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,000
don't at least immediately have a bound
 

2189
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,270
don't at least immediately have a bound
on this number in terms of n right like

2190
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
on this number in terms of n right like
 

2191
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,390
on this number in terms of n right like
it could be that my Edge weights are

2192
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
it could be that my Edge weights are
 

2193
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,750
it could be that my Edge weights are
like really

2194
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:01,760
like really
 

2195
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,390
like really
ginormous uh okay so uh right so how can

2196
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,400
ginormous uh okay so uh right so how can
 

2197
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,030
ginormous uh okay so uh right so how can
we get around that well essentially what

2198
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:08,040
we get around that well essentially what
 

2199
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,710
we get around that well essentially what
we want to be doing is binary search in

2200
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:09,720
we want to be doing is binary search in
 

2201
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,270
we want to be doing is binary search in
an array that scales like the vertices

2202
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:12,280
an array that scales like the vertices
 

2203
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,670
an array that scales like the vertices
okay uh and here's the solution that I

2204
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:14,680
okay uh and here's the solution that I
 

2205
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,349
okay uh and here's the solution that I
came up with which I'm pretty sure is

2206
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:16,359
came up with which I'm pretty sure is
 

2207
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:17,750
came up with which I'm pretty sure is
the same as one in the answer I should

2208
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:17,760
the same as one in the answer I should
 

2209
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,790
the same as one in the answer I should
really check that before uh teaching

2210
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:19,800
really check that before uh teaching
 

2211
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,750
really check that before uh teaching
this thing uh which is to do the

2212
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:22,760
this thing uh which is to do the
 

2213
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,670
this thing uh which is to do the
following which is a remember like

2214
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
following which is a remember like
 

2215
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,390
following which is a remember like
again we have a budget at n log n and so

2216
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:30,400
again we have a budget at n log n and so
 

2217
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,030
again we have a budget at n log n and so
we can do a constant number of things

2218
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,040
we can do a constant number of things
 

2219
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,750
we can do a constant number of things
that take n log n time we just might as

2220
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
that take n log n time we just might as
 

2221
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,990
that take n log n time we just might as
well keep doing it yeah and so another

2222
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
well keep doing it yeah and so another
 

2223
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,630
well keep doing it yeah and so another
kind of convenient thing we might do is

2224
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,640
kind of convenient thing we might do is
 

2225
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,670
kind of convenient thing we might do is
sort my

2226
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680
sort my
 

2227
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,190
sort my
vertices by the

2228
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,200
vertices by the
 

2229
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,750
vertices by the
distance to X which of course remember

2230
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
distance to X which of course remember
 

2231
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,750
distance to X which of course remember
is exactly the distance to their closest

2232
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:49,760
is exactly the distance to their closest
 

2233
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,630
is exactly the distance to their closest
sensor why would you do that well in

2234
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:51,640
sensor why would you do that well in
 

2235
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,430
sensor why would you do that well in
some sense like as I move along that

2236
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:54,440
some sense like as I move along that
 

2237
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,990
some sense like as I move along that
array that's the sort of order in which

2238
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:57,000
array that's the sort of order in which
 

2239
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,870
array that's the sort of order in which
I'm going to remove vertices from My

00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:58,880
I'm going to remove vertices from My
 

2241
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,750
I'm going to remove vertices from My
Graph and make the radius get bigger and

2242
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:00,760
Graph and make the radius get bigger and
 

2243
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,829
Graph and make the radius get bigger and
bigger and bigger does that make sense

2244
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:02,839
bigger and bigger does that make sense
 

2245
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:04,069
bigger and bigger does that make sense
because like these you know the first

2246
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:04,079
because like these you know the first
 

2247
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,270
because like these you know the first

00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:10,800
they get farther and farther away okay
 

2253
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,910
they get farther and farther away okay
so we're going to say and and of course

2254
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:12,920
so we're going to say and and of course
 

2255
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,510
so we're going to say and and of course
why can we do that because sorting I

distances are like one 2 five s right so
 

2293
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,470
distances are like one 2 five s right so
these are the distance of some vertex to

these are the distance of some vertex to
 

2295
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,390
these are the distance of some vertex to
a sensor and let's say that I test three

this array right so it makes sense to do

2312
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:28,520
this array right so it makes sense to do
 

2313
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,910
this array right so it makes sense to do
binary search not in distance space but

2314
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:30,920
binary search not in distance space but
 

2315
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,549
binary search not in distance space but
rather in Array index space because

2316
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:32,559
rather in Array index space because
 

2317
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,390
rather in Array index space because
those are the sort of place junctures

2318
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
those are the sort of place junctures
 

2319
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,630
those are the sort of place junctures
that determine when I'm going to uh

2320
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:36,640
that determine when I'm going to uh
 

2321
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,430
that determine when I'm going to uh
remove stuff okay so

2322
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:40,440
remove stuff okay so
 

2323
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,190
remove stuff okay so
uh right so remember how big is this

2324
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,200
uh right so remember how big is this
 

2325
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,589
uh right so remember how big is this
array it's got length n so overall this

2326
00:47:46,589 --> 00:47:46,599
array it's got length n so overall this
 

2327
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:50,390
array it's got length n so overall this
binary search takes log n time and

2328
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
binary search takes log n time and
 

2329
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,630
binary search takes log n time and
that's good because our whole algorithm

2330
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:52,640
that's good because our whole algorithm
 

2331
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,470
that's good because our whole algorithm
now what do we do we binary search on D

2332
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:56,480
now what do we do we binary search on D
 

2333
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,870
now what do we do we binary search on D
or rather we binary search on I and then

2334
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:58,880
or rather we binary search on I and then
 

2335
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,069
or rather we binary search on I and then
we take Di and plug it into our our

2336
00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:01,079
we take Di and plug it into our our
 

2337
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,710
we take Di and plug it into our our
algorithm up there to construct our

2338
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:02,720
algorithm up there to construct our
 

2339
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,190
algorithm up there to construct our
subgraph we test yes or no and that

2340
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:05,200
subgraph we test yes or no and that
 

2341
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,750
subgraph we test yes or no and that
tells us the left or the right interval

2342
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:06,760
tells us the left or the right interval
 

2343
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,309
tells us the left or the right interval
in our binary search and and we

2344
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:09,319
in our binary search and and we
 

2345
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,710
in our binary search and and we
recurse uh and so overall uh this takes

2346
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
recurse uh and so overall uh this takes
 

2347
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,750
recurse uh and so overall uh this takes
log n time but uh or rather log

2348
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:16,760
log n time but uh or rather log
 

2349
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,270
log n time but uh or rather log
n

2350
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280

2352
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:22,839
steps of binary
 

2353
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:25,750
steps of binary
search uh and of course each one of uh

2354
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:25,760
search uh and of course each one of uh
 

2355
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,829
search uh and of course each one of uh
these steps as I argued up there takes

2356
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:28,839
these steps as I argued up there takes
 

2357
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,790
these steps as I argued up there takes
order n time so overall our algorithm

2358
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:32,800
order n time so overall our algorithm
 

2359
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,750
order n time so overall our algorithm
takes order and log oh no I made an

2360
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:36,760
takes order and log oh no I made an
 

2361
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,630
takes order and log oh no I made an
accidental Theta and log n uh time and

2362
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
accidental Theta and log n uh time and
 

2363
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,870
accidental Theta and log n uh time and
that was the bound we wanted uh to

2364
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:42,880
that was the bound we wanted uh to
 

2365
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,109
that was the bound we wanted uh to
achieve as usual there's like a lot of

00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
achieve as usual there's like a lot of
 

2367
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,630
achieve as usual there's like a lot of
detritus that we need to clean up at the

00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:46,640
detritus that we need to clean up at the
 

2369
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,430
detritus that we need to clean up at the
end of our problem here one of them is

2370
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:48,440
end of our problem here one of them is
 

2371
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,829
end of our problem here one of them is
that we actually want to return a path

2372
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:50,839
that we actually want to return a path
 

2373
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:52,309
that we actually want to return a path
uh but that's not so bad right so now we

2374
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:52,319
uh but that's not so bad right so now we
 

2375
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,309
uh but that's not so bad right so now we
we we've essentially determined that we

2376
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:54,319
we we've essentially determined that we
 

2377
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,829
we we've essentially determined that we
can compute Kar in N log end time well

2378
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
can compute Kar in N log end time well
 

2379
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,150
can compute Kar in N log end time well
that's good it says now if we actually

2380
00:48:59,150 --> 00:48:59,160
that's good it says now if we actually
 

2381
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,430
that's good it says now if we actually
want the path we can construct our graph

2382
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:02,440
want the path we can construct our graph
 

2383
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,190
want the path we can construct our graph
one more time right at K star I suppose

algorithm is uh to go from s to t uh and
and give Katniss the path that she wants

2394
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:15,040
and give Katniss the path that she wants
 

2395
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,549

here so now we're playing like okay Pawn

2452
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:23,799
here so now we're playing like okay Pawn
 

2453
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:30,470
here so now we're playing like okay Pawn
or something like that

2454

wouldn't have to waste half of class

2460
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:34,359
wouldn't have to waste half of class
 

2461
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:38,829
wouldn't have to waste half of class

2462
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:38,839

 

2463
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,789

so
 

2467
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,349
so
cool so now we have Ashley gum and

2468
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:49,359
cool so now we have Ashley gum and
 

2469
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,150
cool so now we have Ashley gum and
Ashley gum is trying to go from twinkl

2470
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:51,160
Ashley gum is trying to go from twinkl

Ashley gum is trying to go from twinkl
town to blue blue Bluff and uh these are

2472
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:53,920
town to blue blue Bluff and uh these are
 

2473
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,309
town to blue blue Bluff and uh these are
both two clearings in the TKO region I'm

2474
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:56,319
both two clearings in the TKO region I'm
 

2475
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,829
both two clearings in the TKO region I'm
sure if I played Pokemon this would have

2476
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
sure if I played Pokemon this would have
 

2477
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,190
sure if I played Pokemon this would have
meaning to me uh or whatever this is uh

2478
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:01,200
meaning to me uh or whatever this is uh
 

2479
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,230
meaning to me uh or whatever this is uh
but in any

2480
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:02,240
but in any
 

2481
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,270
but in any
event we have a bunch of map we have a

2482
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
event we have a bunch of map we have a
 

2483
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,150
event we have a bunch of map we have a
map of a bunch of

2484
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:07,160
map of a bunch of
 

2485
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,470
map of a bunch of
clearings not liking the erasing on this

2486
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:09,480
clearings not liking the erasing on this
 

2487
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,870
clearings not liking the erasing on this
board so maybe we'll start up

2488
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:13,880

 

2489
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:20,990

here okay so we have uh n

2490
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:21,000

 

2491
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,349

clearings uh and they're connected by

2492
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:24,359
clearings uh and they're connected by
 

2493
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:28,750
clearings uh and they're connected by
two way

2494
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:28,760

 

2495
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,910

Trails uh and thankfully there's less

2496
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
Trails uh and thankfully there's less
 

2497
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,870
Trails uh and thankfully there's less
than or equal to five Trails connecting

2498
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:33,880
than or equal to five Trails connecting
 

2499
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,710
than or equal to five Trails connecting
in every clearing this is like our

2500
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:35,720
in every clearing this is like our
 

2501
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,910
in every clearing this is like our
favorite detail to add to six6 problems

2502
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:38,920
favorite detail to add to six6 problems
 

2503
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,309
favorite detail to add to six6 problems
is a degree bound y okay now with every

2504
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:43,319
is a degree bound y okay now with every
 

2505
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:46,109
is a degree bound y okay now with every
Trail um we

2506
00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:46,119
Trail um we
 

2507
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,390
Trail um we
associate um a length

2508
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,400
associate um a length
 

2509
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,510
associate um a length
um which we're going to call L subt for

2510
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:53,520
um which we're going to call L subt for
 

2511
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,309
um which we're going to call L subt for
Trail T but an addition to that we're

2512
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:56,319
Trail T but an addition to that we're
 

2513
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,589
Trail T but an addition to that we're
going to have another piece of

00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,549
going to have another piece of
information which is that it has a set

2516
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:00,559
information which is that it has a set
 

2517
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,589
information which is that it has a set
of Critters on a c

our our our character here is walking
 

2523
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,750
our our our character here is walking
along the path and what does she want to

2524
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:10,760
along the path and what does she want to
 

2525
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,710
along the path and what does she want to
do anytime that she walks along a path

2526
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
do anytime that she walks along a path
 

2527

if she ran out of her tools for picking
 

2553
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,109
if she ran out of her tools for picking
up these Critters which are apparently

2554
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
up these Critters which are apparently
 

2555
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:49,549
up these Critters which are apparently
pocket spheres and she has uh K

2556
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:49,559

 

2557
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,390

spheres in other words she has like a

2558
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:51,400
spheres in other words she has like a
 

2559
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,829
spheres in other words she has like a
backpack and the backpack can hold that

2560
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:52,839
backpack and the backpack can hold that
 

2561
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:56,190
backpack and the backpack can hold that
many spheres at a time okay uh there are

2562
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:56,200
many spheres at a time okay uh there are
 

2563
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,910
many spheres at a time okay uh there are
a few uh details here one is that every

2564
00:52:58,910 --> 00:52:58,920
a few uh details here one is that every
 

2565
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,710
a few uh details here one is that every
time she walks down a path she collects

2566
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:01,720
time she walks down a path she collects
 

2567
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,710
time she walks down a path she collects
all the critters but then if she walks

2568
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:03,720
all the critters but then if she walks
 

2569
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,910
all the critters but then if she walks
down that path again she'll collect the

2570
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:04,920
down that path again she'll collect the
 

2571
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,349
down that path again she'll collect the
same set of Critters apparently they

2572
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:06,359
same set of Critters apparently they
 

2573
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:08,349
same set of Critters apparently they
they respawn they're very prolific these

2574
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:08,359
they respawn they're very prolific these
 

2575
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:11,829
they respawn they're very prolific these
these Critters uh and moreover uh there

2576
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
these Critters uh and moreover uh there
 

2577
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,109
these Critters uh and moreover uh there
are

2578
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:15,119

 

2579
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,990

stores uh some of the

2580
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:21,000

 

2581
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,470

clearings and at these stores uh she can

2582
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:24,480
clearings and at these stores uh she can
 

2583
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,670
clearings and at these stores uh she can
get rid of

2584
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
get rid of
 

2585
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,030
get rid of
the critor she currently has and drop

2586
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:28,040
the critor she currently has and drop
 

2587
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,829
the critor she currently has and drop
them off and pick up uh empty uh spheres

2588
00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:30,839
them off and pick up uh empty uh spheres
 

2589
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:32,630
them off and pick up uh empty uh spheres
instead right so essentially every time

2590
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
instead right so essentially every time
 

2591
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,270
instead right so essentially every time
she does that she empties her backpack

2592
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:34,280
she does that she empties her backpack
 

2593
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,150
she does that she empties her backpack
and gets a new set of material where she

2594
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:36,160
and gets a new set of material where she
 

2595
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,589
and gets a new set of material where she
can keep picking up the critters I have

2596
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:38,599
can keep picking up the critters I have
 

2597
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:40,230
can keep picking up the critters I have
many questions about this character like

2598
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:40,240
many questions about this character like
 

2599
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,710
many questions about this character like
does she just leave them there does she

2600
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:41,720
does she just leave them there does she
 

2601
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,109
does she just leave them there does she
come back for them later what does she

2602
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:44,119
come back for them later what does she
 

2603
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:45,950
come back for them later what does she
do with the critters there's there's a

2604
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:45,960
do with the critters there's there's a
 

2605
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,230
do with the critters there's there's a
lot of questions like does she have a

2606
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:47,240
lot of questions like does she have a
 

2607
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,870
lot of questions like does she have a
bigger bag she can go back around to the

2608
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:49,880
bigger bag she can go back around to the
 

2609
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,510
bigger bag she can go back around to the
stores but in this fictional Universe

2610
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:52,520
stores but in this fictional Universe
 

2611
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,630
stores but in this fictional Universe
we're not going to worry about these

2612
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:53,640
we're not going to worry about these
 

2613
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,829
we're not going to worry about these
problems okay and so um right so

2614
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
problems okay and so um right so
 

2615
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,430
problems okay and so um right so
essentially the question here is that

2616
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:00,440
essentially the question here is that
 

2617
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,190
essentially the question here is that
there are two uh uh locations I don't

2618
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:04,200
there are two uh uh locations I don't
 

2619
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,630
there are two uh uh locations I don't
remember the name trundle trown to Blue

2620
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640
remember the name trundle trown to Blue
 

2621
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,750
remember the name trundle trown to Blue
Bluff that she's trying to travel in

2622
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:08,760
Bluff that she's trying to travel in
 

2623
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,230
Bluff that she's trying to travel in
between and she gets sad if she comes

2624
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:13,240
between and she gets sad if she comes
 

2625
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,309
between and she gets sad if she comes
across a critter that she can't collect

2626
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:15,319
across a critter that she can't collect
 

2627
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:18,190
across a critter that she can't collect
so the question

2628
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:18,200
so the question
 

2629
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,510
so the question
is can you find the

2630
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:22,520

 

2631
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,069

shortest

2632
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
shortest
 

2633
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,710
shortest
path

2634
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:25,720
path
 

2635
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,990
path
without

2636
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,000
without
 

2637
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,270
without
being

2638
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:30,280
being
 

2639
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,549
being
sad and in like kind of a da da twist in

2640
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:33,559
sad and in like kind of a da da twist in
 

2641
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:36,870
sad and in like kind of a da da twist in
this problem uh if no such path exists

2642
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:36,880
this problem uh if no such path exists
 

2643
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,309
this problem uh if no such path exists
in other words there's like she has to

2644
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:38,319
in other words there's like she has to
 

2645
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,829
in other words there's like she has to
walk along some long trail with a bunch

2646
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:39,839
walk along some long trail with a bunch
 

2647
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,270
walk along some long trail with a bunch
of Critters more than K Critters I guess

2648
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:42,280
of Critters more than K Critters I guess
 

2649
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,630
of Critters more than K Critters I guess
in the worst case then sadness is

2650
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,640
in the worst case then sadness is
 

2651
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,430
in the worst case then sadness is
unavoidable is what your code is

2652
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:46,440
unavoidable is what your code is
 

2653
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,190
unavoidable is what your code is
apparently supposed to uh return which

2654
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:50,200
apparently supposed to uh return which
 

2655
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,109
apparently supposed to uh return which
is

2656
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:51,119
is
 

2657
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,870
is
really defe us I I don't know who wrote

2658
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:53,880
really defe us I I don't know who wrote
 

2659
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,750
really defe us I I don't know who wrote
this problems that um

2660
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:56,760
this problems that um
 

2661
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,069
this problems that um
okay the question is how do we how do we

2662
00:54:59,069 --> 00:54:59,079
okay the question is how do we how do we
 

2663
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:00,750
okay the question is how do we how do we
solve this it looks like a shortest path

2664
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:00,760
solve this it looks like a shortest path
 

2665
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,549
solve this it looks like a shortest path
problem but as with all problems in 66

2666
00:55:03,549 --> 00:55:03,559
problem but as with all problems in 66
 

2667
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,150
problem but as with all problems in 66
there's a slight twist right and in this

2668
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:05,160
there's a slight twist right and in this
 

2669
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,230
there's a slight twist right and in this
case the twist uh is that it's the

2670
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:07,240
case the twist uh is that it's the
 

2671
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,829
case the twist uh is that it's the
shortest path without becoming sad where

2672
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839
shortest path without becoming sad where
 

2673
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,349
shortest path without becoming sad where
sadness means that you ran out of

2674
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:12,359
sadness means that you ran out of
 

2675
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:16,549
sadness means that you ran out of
spheres to collect your your

2676
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559

 

2677
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,710

craters now notice that we're given a

2678
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:19,720
craters now notice that we're given a
 

2679
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,309
craters now notice that we're given a
budget by the way of I believe NK log NK

2680
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:23,319
budget by the way of I believe NK log NK
 

2681
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,630
budget by the way of I believe NK log NK
time is that right

2682
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
time is that right
 

2683
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,549
time is that right
like

2684
00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:27,559
like
 

2685
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,630
like
that

2686
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:29,640
that
 

2687
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,710
that
okay notice that this is a little

2688
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:31,720
okay notice that this is a little
 

2689
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,270
okay notice that this is a little
suspicious somehow it makes us think

2690
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
suspicious somehow it makes us think
 

2691
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,190
suspicious somehow it makes us think
that the size of our problem really is

2692
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
that the size of our problem really is
 

2693
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,430
that the size of our problem really is
NK rather than just n or

2694
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:38,440
NK rather than just n or
 

2695
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,829
NK rather than just n or
k okay so uh how could we do this let's

2696
00:55:42,829 --> 00:55:42,839
k okay so uh how could we do this let's
 

2697
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,150
k okay so uh how could we do this let's
think back to a problem that we solved

2698
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
think back to a problem that we solved
 

2699
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,750
think back to a problem that we solved
yesterday under the assumption that you

2700
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
yesterday under the assumption that you
 

2701
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,710
yesterday under the assumption that you
guys are binge watching your uh 66

2702
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
guys are binge watching your uh 66
 

2703
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,549
guys are binge watching your uh 66
problem sessions here uh and remember

2704
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:51,559
problem sessions here uh and remember
 

2705
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:53,190
problem sessions here uh and remember
the problem yesterday we had this dude

2706
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,200
the problem yesterday we had this dude
 

2707
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,549
the problem yesterday we had this dude
that was walking along paths and like

2708
00:55:55,549 --> 00:55:55,559
that was walking along paths and like
 

2709
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,190
that was walking along paths and like
every third path he had to drink a

2710
00:55:59,190 --> 00:55:59,200
every third path he had to drink a
 

2711
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,109
every third path he had to drink a
beer that's I've tried this on my

2712
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:01,119
beer that's I've tried this on my
 

2713
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,510
beer that's I've tried this on my
commute home and it doesn't doesn't work

2714
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:02,520
commute home and it doesn't doesn't work
 

2715
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,230
commute home and it doesn't doesn't work
terribly well uh but in any event we

2716
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:05,240
terribly well uh but in any event we
 

2717
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,470
terribly well uh but in any event we
have kind of a similar scenario here

2718
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:07,480
have kind of a similar scenario here
 

2719
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,710
have kind of a similar scenario here
where like there's some number that we

2720
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:08,720
where like there's some number that we
 

2721
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,430
where like there's some number that we
need to keep track of right there in

2722
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:10,440
need to keep track of right there in
 

2723
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,230
need to keep track of right there in
this case is the number of Critters that

2724
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,240
this case is the number of Critters that
 

2725
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,870
this case is the number of Critters that
our our character has uh remaining that

2726
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:14,880
our our character has uh remaining that
 

2727
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,829
our our character has uh remaining that
she can pick up right so she starts with

2728
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:16,839
she can pick up right so she starts with
 

2729
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,510
she can pick up right so she starts with
an empty bag as she collects them the

2730
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:19,520
an empty bag as she collects them the
 

2731
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,510
an empty bag as she collects them the
amount of capacity in her bag decreases

2732
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,520
amount of capacity in her bag decreases
 

2733
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,069
amount of capacity in her bag decreases
until she gets to a store and then it

2734
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:23,079
until she gets to a store and then it
 

2735
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,230
until she gets to a store and then it
goes back again but the good news is

2736
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:25,240
goes back again but the good news is
 

2737
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,029
goes back again but the good news is
that our runtime bound includes K in it

2738
00:56:27,029 --> 00:56:27,039
that our runtime bound includes K in it
 

2739
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:29,190
that our runtime bound includes K in it
so it's actually okay to make an

2740
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
so it's actually okay to make an
 

2741
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,109
so it's actually okay to make an
algorithm that scales in the number of

2742
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
algorithm that scales in the number of
 

2743
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,750
algorithm that scales in the number of
Critters that she can carry around this

2744
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:32,760
Critters that she can carry around this
 

2745
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,870
Critters that she can carry around this
kind of a typical but but an interesting

2746
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
kind of a typical but but an interesting
 

2747
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,390
kind of a typical but but an interesting
uh Choice here okay so remember the the

2748
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,400
uh Choice here okay so remember the the
 

2749
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,870
uh Choice here okay so remember the the
term I introduced last time for this

2750
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:39,880
term I introduced last time for this
 

2751
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,109
term I introduced last time for this
kind of universe is that it's called

2752
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:41,119
kind of universe is that it's called
 

2753
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,430
kind of universe is that it's called
like a state machine like in addition to

2754
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:43,440
like a state machine like in addition to
 

2755
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,270
like a state machine like in addition to
walking along the graph she needs to

2756
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:45,280
walking along the graph she needs to
 

2757
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,630
walking along the graph she needs to
know how much capacity she has for

2758
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:48,640
know how much capacity she has for
 

2759
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,910
know how much capacity she has for
craters uh and so here's here's a way to

2760
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:50,920
craters uh and so here's here's a way to
 

2761
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,309
craters uh and so here's here's a way to
do it so I think actually this problem

2762
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:52,319
do it so I think actually this problem
 

2763
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,390
do it so I think actually this problem
isn't too bad given that you saw the

2764
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:55,400
isn't too bad given that you saw the
 

2765
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,390
isn't too bad given that you saw the
problem where you do every third vertex

2766
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:57,400
problem where you do every third vertex
 

2767
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,870
problem where you do every third vertex
uh in our last problem session somehow

2768
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,880
uh in our last problem session somehow
 

2769
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,789
uh in our last problem session somehow
it's it's just like a same church

2770
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:00,799
it's it's just like a same church
 

2771
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,510
it's it's just like a same church
different Pew kind of scenario here so

2772
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
different Pew kind of scenario here so
 

2773
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,349
different Pew kind of scenario here so
in this case uh one thing we can do is

2774
00:57:06,349 --> 00:57:06,359
in this case uh one thing we can do is
 

2775
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:09,430
in this case uh one thing we can do is
we're going to make a graph to colum G

2776
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
we're going to make a graph to colum G
 

2777
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,870
we're going to make a graph to colum G
he's got vertices V EDG is E just for

2778
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:11,880
he's got vertices V EDG is E just for
 

2779
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,549
he's got vertices V EDG is E just for
fun um but what we're going to do is

2780
00:57:15,549 --> 00:57:15,559
fun um but what we're going to do is
 

2781
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:20,270
fun um but what we're going to do is
have k + one

2782
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:20,280

 

2783
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,510

vertices for every

2784
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,520
vertices for every
 

2785
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,069
vertices for every
clearing and the reason is that what

2786
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
clearing and the reason is that what
 

2787
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,309
clearing and the reason is that what
we're going to do is we're going to walk

2788
00:57:27,309 --> 00:57:27,319
we're going to do is we're going to walk
 

2789
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,549
we're going to do is we're going to walk
along the graph and as we Traverse our

2790
00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:29,559
along the graph and as we Traverse our
 

2791
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,309
along the graph and as we Traverse our
edges we're not only going to keep track

2792
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:31,319
edges we're not only going to keep track
 

2793
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:32,950
edges we're not only going to keep track
of the costs like the distance that

2794
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:32,960
of the costs like the distance that
 

2795
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,549
of the costs like the distance that
she's walking but also the number of

2796
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
she's walking but also the number of
 

2797
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,190
she's walking but also the number of
Critters that she has remaining in her

2798
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:38,200
Critters that she has remaining in her
 

2799
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,470
Critters that she has remaining in her
bag that she can store and the way that

2800
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
bag that she can store and the way that
 

2801
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,950
bag that she can store and the way that
we can do that is by like keeping a

2802
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:41,960
we can do that is by like keeping a
 

2803
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,069
we can do that is by like keeping a
bunch of copies of our graph and

2804
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079
bunch of copies of our graph and
 

2805
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,549
bunch of copies of our graph and
ascending every time that we collect a

2806
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
ascending every time that we collect a
 

2807
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,870
ascending every time that we collect a
new Critter does that make

2808
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:48,880
new Critter does that make
 

2809
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,349
new Critter does that make
sense okay so here's a let's let's add a

2810
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:51,359
sense okay so here's a let's let's add a
 

2811
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,549
sense okay so here's a let's let's add a
little bit more detail here so in

2812
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:52,559
little bit more detail here so in
 

2813
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,829
little bit more detail here so in
particular I can define v c comma I is

2814
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:55,839
particular I can define v c comma I is
 

2815
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,069
particular I can define v c comma I is
going to be the vertex per clearing

2816
00:57:59,069 --> 00:57:59,079
going to be the vertex per clearing
 

2817
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:01,829
going to be the vertex per clearing
comma crater space uh and and the way

2818
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:01,839
comma crater space uh and and the way
 

2819
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,829
comma crater space uh and and the way
that I can view it is that this is um

2820
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:04,839
that I can view it is that this is um
 

2821
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:09,349
that I can view it is that this is um
sort of representing that I'm at

2822
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359

 

2823
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,270

clearing oops this should be a

2824
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:12,280
clearing oops this should be a
 

2825
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,670
clearing oops this should be a
c uh and I have

2826
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,680
c uh and I have
 

2827
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:22,670
c uh and I have
a i pocket

2828
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:22,680

 

2829
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:28,029

spheres uh that are empty

2830
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:28,039

 

2831
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:29,630

okay so like initially I'm going to

2832
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:29,640
okay so like initially I'm going to
 

2833
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:35,230
okay so like initially I'm going to
start at vs comma 0 and go from there

2834
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:35,240
start at vs comma 0 and go from there
 

2835
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,630
start at vs comma 0 and go from there
okay okay oh it dep I guess it depends

2836
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:38,640
okay okay oh it dep I guess it depends
 

2837
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,630
okay okay oh it dep I guess it depends
whether you're decreasing it or

2838
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:39,640
whether you're decreasing it or
 

2839
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,670
whether you're decreasing it or
increasing

2840
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
increasing
 

2841
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,789
increasing
it oh you're right yeah I'm sorry so in

2842
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:44,799
it oh you're right yeah I'm sorry so in
 

2843
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,430
it oh you're right yeah I'm sorry so in
that case I guess it would be K we'll

2844
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:46,440
that case I guess it would be K we'll
 

2845
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,870
that case I guess it would be K we'll
see if I manage to do that consistently

2846
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:47,880
see if I manage to do that consistently
 

2847
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,309
see if I manage to do that consistently
throughout my my answer here um okay so

2848
00:58:51,309 --> 00:58:51,319
throughout my my answer here um okay so
 

2849
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,910
throughout my my answer here um okay so
now I need to tell you how to make the

2850
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:52,920
now I need to tell you how to make the
 

2851
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,270
now I need to tell you how to make the
uh the edges in our graph and so let's

2852
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:54,280
uh the edges in our graph and so let's
 

2853
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,829
uh the edges in our graph and so let's
do that next next so in

2854
00:58:56,829 --> 00:58:56,839
do that next next so in
 

2855
00:58:56,839 --> 00:59:00,430
do that next next so in
particular for all

2856
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:00,440
particular for all
 

2857
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,349
particular for all
trails from a uh between a and b um

2858
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:06,359
trails from a uh between a and b um
 

2859
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:09,029
trails from a uh between a and b um
with

2860
00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:09,039
with
 

2861
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:15,789
with
length uh L um and uh Critter

2862
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:15,799

 

2863
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:19,750

C right so she picks up C Critters she

2864
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:19,760
C right so she picks up C Critters she
 

2865
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,950
C right so she picks up C Critters she
traverses distance L she gets from A to

2866
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
traverses distance L she gets from A to
 

2867
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,710
traverses distance L she gets from A to
B or vice versa our trails are are are

2868
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:25,720
B or vice versa our trails are are are
 

2869
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,069
B or vice versa our trails are are are
bidirectional

2870
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:27,079
bidirectional
 

2871
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:34,069
bidirectional
here uh we need to Define

2872
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:34,079

 

2873
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,630

edges and they look like this so we sort

2874
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:36,640
edges and they look like this so we sort
 

2875
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,390
edges and they look like this so we sort
of have two different cases uh one uh is

2876
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:39,400
of have two different cases uh one uh is
 

2877
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,390
of have two different cases uh one uh is
where uh you have a store and when is

2878
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:41,400
where uh you have a store and when is
 

2879
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,109
where uh you have a store and when is
when you don't right because that that's

2880
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:43,119
when you don't right because that that's
 

2881
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,789
when you don't right because that that's
going to affect how your your state

2882
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:44,799
going to affect how your your state
 

2883
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,870
going to affect how your your state
changes

2884
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:47,880

 

2885
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,549

so right so the first one would be uh oh

2886
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:52,559
so right so the first one would be uh oh
 

2887
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,190
so right so the first one would be uh oh
did I get this whole thing backward oh

2888
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:54,200
did I get this whole thing backward oh
 

2889
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,950
did I get this whole thing backward oh
don't tell me

2890
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:55,960
don't tell me
 

2891
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:00,430
don't tell me
that no I did okay good um great so the

2892
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:00,440
that no I did okay good um great so the
 

2893
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,510
that no I did okay good um great so the
first case would be a does not has have

2894
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,520
first case would be a does not has have
 

2895
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,549
first case would be a does not has have
a

2896
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:04,559
a
 

2897
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:11,470
a
store

2898
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:11,480

 

2899
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,750

um right so in this case she leaves with

2900
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:14,760
um right so in this case she leaves with
 

2901
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,190
um right so in this case she leaves with
the same number of Critters she had in

2902
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:16,200
the same number of Critters she had in
 

2903
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,950
the same number of Critters she had in
her bag minus whatever Critter she picks

2904
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:18,960
her bag minus whatever Critter she picks
 

2905
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,270
her bag minus whatever Critter she picks
up along the way right so now I'm going

2906
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,280
up along the way right so now I'm going
 

2907
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,829
up along the way right so now I'm going
to have a uh an edge

2908
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:26,839

 

2909
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,029

of

2910
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:29,039
of
 

2911
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:30,670

length

2912
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:30,680
length
 

2913
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,029
length
L uh and I'm going to go

2914
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:34,039
L uh and I'm going to go
 

2915
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:39,549
L uh and I'm going to go
from va a comma I

2916
01:00:39,549 --> 01:00:39,559
from va a comma I
 

2917
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:45,109
from va a comma I
to v b comma I minus C right so the idea

2918
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
to v b comma I minus C right so the idea
 

2919
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,390
to v b comma I minus C right so the idea
is that I go from A to B and in the

2920
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:47,400
is that I go from A to B and in the
 

2921
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,349
is that I go from A to B and in the
process I lose C Critters right but I

2922
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:50,359
process I lose C Critters right but I
 

2923
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:51,910
process I lose C Critters right but I
have to do this for all the possible

2924
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:51,920
have to do this for all the possible
 

2925
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,029
have to do this for all the possible
eyes that I could see in my state so

2926
01:00:55,029 --> 01:00:55,039
eyes that I could see in my state so
 

2927
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:58,190
eyes that I could see in my state so
that goes from

2928
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:58,200

 

2929
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,150

2932
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
K
 

2933
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,069
K
right

2934
01:01:07,069 --> 01:01:07,079
right
 

2935
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:09,630
right
C associated with the Trail T which I

2936
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:09,640
C associated with the Trail T which I
 

2937
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,670
C associated with the Trail T which I
decided not to use okay uh right so the

2938
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:12,680
decided not to use okay uh right so the
 

2939
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,950
decided not to use okay uh right so the
the basic Point here is that there are a

2940
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:14,960
the basic Point here is that there are a
 

2941
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,069
the basic Point here is that there are a
bunch of different states where I can

2942
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
bunch of different states where I can
 

2943
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,630
bunch of different states where I can
Traverse this Trail but I have to have

2944
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:17,640
Traverse this Trail but I have to have
 

2945
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,510
Traverse this Trail but I have to have
at least C Critters in my bag if I'm

2946
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:19,520
at least C Critters in my bag if I'm
 

2947
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,510
at least C Critters in my bag if I'm
allowed to Traverse this Trail or else I

2948
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:21,520
allowed to Traverse this Trail or else I
 

2949
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,109
allowed to Traverse this Trail or else I
will be sad okay uh and so kind of copy

2950
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
will be sad okay uh and so kind of copy
 

2951
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,470
will be sad okay uh and so kind of copy
this Edge a bunch of different times to

2952
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,480
this Edge a bunch of different times to
 

2953
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,109
this Edge a bunch of different times to
represent all the possible transitions I

2954
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:28,119
represent all the possible transitions I
 

2955
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:28,870
represent all the possible transitions I
could

2956
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:28,880
could
 

2957
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,910
could
make and similarly let's say that a does

2958
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
make and similarly let's say that a does
 

2959
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,270
make and similarly let's say that a does
have a

2960
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,280

 

2961
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,630

store well I still want to add an edge

2962
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:39,640
store well I still want to add an edge
 

2963
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,230
store well I still want to add an edge
but now I have the luxury of clearing

2964
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
but now I have the luxury of clearing
 

2965
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,109
but now I have the luxury of clearing
out all the stuff in my bag uh before

2966
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:44,119
out all the stuff in my bag uh before
 

2967
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:46,950
out all the stuff in my bag uh before
collecting the critters yeah so now uh I

2968
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:46,960
collecting the critters yeah so now uh I
 

2969
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,230
collecting the critters yeah so now uh I
still want an edge of length

2970
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:49,240
still want an edge of length
 

2971
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,069
still want an edge of length
L um but now I get to connect more

2972
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:53,079
L um but now I get to connect more
 

2973
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,870
L um but now I get to connect more
vertices and reset my state state in the

2974
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:54,880
vertices and reset my state state in the
 

2975
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,430
vertices and reset my state state in the
process right so now I'm going to go

2976
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:56,440
process right so now I'm going to go
 

2977
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,829
process right so now I'm going to go
from va a comma I

2978
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:00,839
from va a comma I
 

2979
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:04,309
from va a comma I
to v

2980
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
to v
 

2981
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,430
to v
b and uh where am I going to end

2982
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:07,440
b and uh where am I going to end
 

2983
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,510
b and uh where am I going to end
up well how many Critters are going to

2984
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:09,520
up well how many Critters are going to
 

2985
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,589
up well how many Critters are going to
be in my bag I have a bag of capacity

2986
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:12,599
be in my bag I have a bag of capacity
 

2987
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,269
be in my bag I have a bag of capacity
K and I just Traverse The Edge from A to

2988
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:15,279
K and I just Traverse The Edge from A to
 

2989
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:16,789
K and I just Traverse The Edge from A to
B which contains C

2990
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799
B which contains C
 

2991
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,870
B which contains C
Critters

2992
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:19,880

 

2993
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,109

so I get in v k minus C like that uh and

2994
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:24,119
so I get in v k minus C like that uh and
 

2995
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:26,910
so I get in v k minus C like that uh and
of of course um I can do that for for

2996
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:26,920
of of course um I can do that for for
 

2997
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,309
of of course um I can do that for for
all

2998
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:29,319
all
 

2999
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:31,460
all
I uh

3000
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:31,470
I uh
 

3001
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,910
I uh
[Music]

3002
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:34,920

 

3003
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,990

from oh yeah I have to be

3004
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:39,000

 

3005
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,190

careful well no actually just for all I

3006
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,200
careful well no actually just for all I
 

3007
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,589
careful well no actually just for all I
is fine yeah I think there might be a

3008
01:02:43,589 --> 01:02:43,599
is fine yeah I think there might be a
 

3009
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,990
is fine yeah I think there might be a
there's either mistake in how I copied

3010
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:45,000
there's either mistake in how I copied
 

3011
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,829
there's either mistake in how I copied
it down or a mistake in the problem a

3012
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:46,839
it down or a mistake in the problem a
 

3013
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:51,470
it down or a mistake in the problem a
mistake in the

3014
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:51,480

 

3015
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,430

problem yeah I think this is right yes

3016
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,440
problem yeah I think this is right yes
 

3017
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,589
problem yeah I think this is right yes
so I think there's we we wrote for all I

3018
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:55,599
so I think there's we we wrote for all I
 

3019
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,750
so I think there's we we wrote for all I
and some interval but we didn't have to

3020
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:57,760
and some interval but we didn't have to
 

3021
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,870
and some interval but we didn't have to
okay right so uh those are our different

3022
01:02:59,870 --> 01:02:59,880
okay right so uh those are our different
 

3023
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,470
okay right so uh those are our different
cases right so essentially in this case

3024
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:01,480
cases right so essentially in this case
 

3025
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,230
cases right so essentially in this case
we we we clear out our our Q here or or

3026
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:04,240
we we we clear out our our Q here or or
 

3027
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,230
we we we clear out our our Q here or or
well not even a q just our our set of

3028
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,240
well not even a q just our our set of
 

3029
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,549
well not even a q just our our set of
spheres we reset we go back here notice

3030
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:08,559
spheres we reset we go back here notice
 

3031
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,069
spheres we reset we go back here notice
that the second vertex doesn't even have

3032
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:10,079
that the second vertex doesn't even have
 

3033
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,589
that the second vertex doesn't even have
an i in its index because it doesn't

3034
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:12,599
an i in its index because it doesn't
 

3035
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:16,990
an i in its index because it doesn't
matter okay and then similarly uh you

3036
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:17,000
matter okay and then similarly uh you
 

3037
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,870
matter okay and then similarly uh you
know so that gets me from A to B I also

3038
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:18,880
know so that gets me from A to B I also
 

3039
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,150
know so that gets me from A to B I also
have to do the symmetric thing to go

3040
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
have to do the symmetric thing to go
 

3041
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,269
have to do the symmetric thing to go
from B to

3042
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:23,279

 

3043
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:27,789

a

3044
01:03:27,789 --> 01:03:27,799

 

3045
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:29,910

okay so now I have a

3046
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:29,920
okay so now I have a
 

3047
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,390
okay so now I have a
graph um and first of all we should

3048
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,400
graph um and first of all we should
 

3049
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,430
graph um and first of all we should
reason and make sure uh that we can

3050
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:34,440
reason and make sure uh that we can
 

3051
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,589
reason and make sure uh that we can
actually construct this graph in a

3052
01:03:35,589 --> 01:03:35,599
actually construct this graph in a
 

3053
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,150
actually construct this graph in a
reasonable amount of

3054
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:37,160
reasonable amount of
 

3055
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:48,950
reasonable amount of
time so let's do that really

3056
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960

 

3057
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,630

fast right so uh the number of vertices

3058
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:51,640
fast right so uh the number of vertices
 

3059
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,269
fast right so uh the number of vertices
on our

3060
01:03:53,269 --> 01:03:53,279
on our
 

3061
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:54,990
on our
graph

3062
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:55,000
graph
 

3063
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,190
graph
well I basically have k + one copies of

3064
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
well I basically have k + one copies of
 

3065
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,710
well I basically have k + one copies of
my graph so it's equal to k + 1 * n

3066
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:01,720
my graph so it's equal to k + 1 * n
 

3067
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,910
my graph so it's equal to k + 1 * n
that's good so that's order K and time

3068
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
that's good so that's order K and time
 

3069
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,470
that's good so that's order K and time
uh order K and space I suppose uh and

3070
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:08,480
uh order K and space I suppose uh and
 

3071
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,630
uh order K and space I suppose uh and
similarly uh there's

3072
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:10,640
similarly uh there's
 

3073
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,870
similarly uh there's
K

3074
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:12,880
K
 

3075
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,510
K
edges um that are associated with every

3076
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:16,520
edges um that are associated with every
 

3077
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,150
edges um that are associated with every
Trail and there's order n Trails because

3078
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:19,160
Trail and there's order n Trails because
 

3079
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,109
Trail and there's order n Trails because
I have a degree bound so overall there's

3080
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:22,119
I have a degree bound so overall there's
 

3081
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:25,230
I have a degree bound so overall there's
order k n

3082
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:25,240
order k n
 

3083
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,510
order k n
is in my graph

3084
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:28,520
is in my graph
 

3085
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,309
is in my graph
okay great so now uh my problem is not

3086
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
okay great so now uh my problem is not
 

3087
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,109
okay great so now uh my problem is not
so bad I have a a source uh which is the

3088
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:36,119
so bad I have a a source uh which is the
 

3089
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:39,069
so bad I have a a source uh which is the
the place where our our Walker

3090
01:04:39,069 --> 01:04:39,079
the place where our our Walker
 

3091
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:41,670
the place where our our Walker
starts f t which is the destination

3092
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:41,680
starts f t which is the destination
 

3093
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,150
starts f t which is the destination
where she wants to go um so what do I

3094
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:45,160
where she wants to go um so what do I
 

3095
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,710
where she wants to go um so what do I
need well I just need any

3096
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,720
need well I just need any
 

3097
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,349
need well I just need any
path that starts at

3098
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:52,359
path that starts at
 

3099
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:55,269
path that starts at
vsk right in other words she starts at s

3100
01:04:55,269 --> 01:04:55,279
vsk right in other words she starts at s
 

3101
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:58,109
vsk right in other words she starts at s
and has a full bag with K capacity and

3102
01:04:58,109 --> 01:04:58,119
and has a full bag with K capacity and
 

3103
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:05,510
and has a full bag with K capacity and
ends up at to V uh T comma I for any I

3104
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,520
ends up at to V uh T comma I for any I
 

3105
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,630
ends up at to V uh T comma I for any I
right because it doesn't matter how much

3106
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:06,640
right because it doesn't matter how much
 

3107
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,950
right because it doesn't matter how much
capacity she has in her bag when she

3108
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:07,960
capacity she has in her bag when she
 

3109
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,710
capacity she has in her bag when she
reads her her her

3110
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:09,720
reads her her her
 

3111
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,390
reads her her her
destination um so this is for all I any

3112
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:13,400
destination um so this is for all I any
 

3113
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,069
destination um so this is for all I any
path

3114
01:05:15,069 --> 01:05:15,079
path
 

3115
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:16,710
path
avoids

3116
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
avoids
 

3117
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,630
avoids
sadness and the way this problem is

3118
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:19,640
sadness and the way this problem is
 

3119
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,990
sadness and the way this problem is
written right so how could I do that

3120
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,000
written right so how could I do that
 

3121
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,630
written right so how could I do that
well she wants the shortest path um so I

3122
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:24,640
well she wants the shortest path um so I
 

3123
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,029
well she wants the shortest path um so I
can just do dicer's

3124
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:29,039

 

3125
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,150

algorithm from vsk and do a bit of

3126
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:33,160
algorithm from vsk and do a bit of
 

3127
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,390
algorithm from vsk and do a bit of
cleanup afterward to check all the

3128
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
cleanup afterward to check all the
 

3129
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,750
cleanup afterward to check all the
different eyes and find this closest one

3130
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:36,760
different eyes and find this closest one
 

3131
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,390
different eyes and find this closest one
and how much time does that

3132
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:38,400
and how much time does that
 

3133
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,870
and how much time does that
take well my graph takes KNN spa space

3134
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:42,880
take well my graph takes KNN spa space
 

3135
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,150
take well my graph takes KNN spa space
because it has knen vertices and Order

3136
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:45,160
because it has knen vertices and Order
 

3137
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,349
because it has knen vertices and Order
knen uh edges so

3138
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:48,359
knen uh edges so
 

3139
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:51,589
knen uh edges so
overall this is going to take order KNN

3140
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:51,599
overall this is going to take order KNN
 

3141
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,069
overall this is going to take order KNN
log KNN time time which is a good thing

3142
01:05:55,069 --> 01:05:55,079
log KNN time time which is a good thing
 

3143
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:56,069
log KNN time time which is a good thing
because that's exactly what the problem

3144
01:05:56,069 --> 01:05:56,079
because that's exactly what the problem
 

3145
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:57,029
because that's exactly what the problem
asks

3146
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:57,039
asks
 

3147
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:01,470
asks
for and of course uh uh if the uh

3148
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:01,480
for and of course uh uh if the uh
 

3149
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,069
for and of course uh uh if the uh
shortest path is

3150
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
shortest path is
 

3151
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,309
shortest path is
infinity then what do we

3152
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
infinity then what do we
 

3153
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,880
infinity then what do we
know you say it with me sadness is

3154
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:09,890
know you say it with me sadness is
 

3155
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:17,069
know you say it with me sadness is
[Laughter]

3156
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:17,079

 

3157
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:20,150

unavoidable this is a weird thing to

3158
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,160
unavoidable this is a weird thing to
 

3159
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,390
unavoidable this is a weird thing to
write on a

3160
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:22,400
write on a
 

3161
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,990
write on a
Blackboard okay so that's our basic

3162
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:25,000
Blackboard okay so that's our basic
 

3163
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,630
Blackboard okay so that's our basic
problem here so what was our strategy if

3164
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:26,640
problem here so what was our strategy if
 

3165
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,430
problem here so what was our strategy if
we step back 10 ft essentially we took

3166
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:28,440
we step back 10 ft essentially we took
 

3167
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,150
we step back 10 ft essentially we took
our graph um and rather than just making

3168
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:31,160
our graph um and rather than just making
 

3169
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,829
our graph um and rather than just making
our graph we make K copies of it with

3170
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:32,839
our graph we make K copies of it with
 

3171
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:35,190
our graph we make K copies of it with
edges that kind of Point upstairs uh

3172
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:35,200
edges that kind of Point upstairs uh
 

3173
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,029
edges that kind of Point upstairs uh
meaning that you you you give away

3174
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:37,039
meaning that you you you give away
 

3175
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,029
meaning that you you you give away
spheres uh in the the process of

3176
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:39,039
spheres uh in the the process of
 

3177
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,029
spheres uh in the the process of
traversing these different edges except

3178
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
traversing these different edges except
 

3179
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,430
traversing these different edges except
when you hit the stores which brings you

3180
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:42,440
when you hit the stores which brings you
 

3181
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,829
when you hit the stores which brings you
back to level zero um so that was our

3182
01:06:44,829 --> 01:06:44,839
back to level zero um so that was our
 

3183
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:46,230
back to level zero um so that was our
our basic graph structure and then we

3184
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:46,240
our basic graph structure and then we
 

3185
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,510
our basic graph structure and then we
just need to do shortest path on that

3186
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:48,520
just need to do shortest path on that
 

3187
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,870
just need to do shortest path on that
thing all right any questions about that

3188
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:50,880
thing all right any questions about that
 

3189
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,710
thing all right any questions about that
yes last time we did graph duplication

3190
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
yes last time we did graph duplication
 

3191
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,990
yes last time we did graph duplication
we made a it was layered graph and you

3192
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
we made a it was layered graph and you
 

3193
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,190
we made a it was layered graph and you
kept making these Transitions and it was

3194
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:00,200
kept making these Transitions and it was
 

3195
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,710
kept making these Transitions and it was
a d so can't we do this in linear time

3196
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:03,720
a d so can't we do this in linear time
 

3197
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,750
a d so can't we do this in linear time
can't we do this in linear time so in

3198
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:06,760
can't we do this in linear time so in
 

3199
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,750
can't we do this in linear time so in
other words why is our graph not a dag

3200
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:08,760
other words why is our graph not a dag
 

3201
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,349
other words why is our graph not a dag
in this particular case

3202
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:11,359
in this particular case
 

3203
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:16,309
in this particular case
um let me think about that for a

3204
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:16,319

 

3205
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,150

second what there's something about this

3206
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,160
second what there's something about this
 

3207
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,549
second what there's something about this
problem that mean it says that the graph

3208
01:07:19,549 --> 01:07:19,559
problem that mean it says that the graph
 

3209
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:21,710
problem that mean it says that the graph
has to be a dag uh in particular I guess

3210
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:21,720
has to be a dag uh in particular I guess
 

3211
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,510
has to be a dag uh in particular I guess
you could keep walking like if you had a

3212
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
you could keep walking like if you had a
 

3213
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,349
you could keep walking like if you had a
path with a store that were exactly the

3214
01:07:26,349 --> 01:07:26,359
path with a store that were exactly the
 

3215
01:07:26,359 --> 01:07:27,630
path with a store that were exactly the
same as the number of Critters you could

3216
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:27,640
same as the number of Critters you could
 

3217
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,390
same as the number of Critters you could
keep walking back and forth along that

3218
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:29,400
keep walking back and forth along that
 

3219
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,430
keep walking back and forth along that
path um and so there's like a little

3220
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:31,440
path um and so there's like a little
 

3221
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,829
path um and so there's like a little
cycle there which would be enough to not

3222
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:33,839
cycle there which would be enough to not
 

3223
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,990
cycle there which would be enough to not
be able to do it in linear time well the

3224
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,000
be able to do it in linear time well the
 

3225
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,670
be able to do it in linear time well the
edges that we constructed are not Ed are

3226
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:38,680
edges that we constructed are not Ed are
 

3227
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,549
edges that we constructed are not Ed are
not don't necessarily correspond to the

3228
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:40,559
not don't necessarily correspond to the
 

3229
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,510
not don't necessarily correspond to the
edges in the original Trails that's not

3230
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:42,520
edges in the original Trails that's not
 

3231
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,269
edges in the original Trails that's not
the problem uh sure that's absolutely

3232
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:45,279
the problem uh sure that's absolutely
 

3233
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,150
the problem uh sure that's absolutely
right so we we constructed a directed

3234
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:47,160
right so we we constructed a directed
 

3235
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,349
right so we we constructed a directed
graph out of our original one but that

3236
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:49,359
graph out of our original one but that
 

3237
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,230
graph out of our original one but that
director graph also can contain Cycles

3238
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:51,240
director graph also can contain Cycles
 

3239
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,190
director graph also can contain Cycles
right um so yeah so I I think the

3240
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:54,200
right um so yeah so I I think the
 

3241
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,630
right um so yeah so I I think the
example I'm giving you works so I have a

3242
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:55,640
example I'm giving you works so I have a
 

3243
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,910
example I'm giving you works so I have a
graph with two vertices maybe there's

3244
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:58,920
graph with two vertices maybe there's
 

3245
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,470
graph with two vertices maybe there's
other grass stuff going on but whatever

3246
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:01,480
other grass stuff going on but whatever
 

3247
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,829
other grass stuff going on but whatever
I have two vertices here and I have some

3248
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:03,839
I have two vertices here and I have some
 

3249
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,910
I have two vertices here and I have some
number of Critters here and I have a

3250
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:06,920
number of Critters here and I have a
 

3251
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,670
number of Critters here and I have a
store on either end of my Edge just

3252
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:09,680
store on either end of my Edge just
 

3253
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,630
store on either end of my Edge just
because I'm boring and

3254
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:12,640

 

3255
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,990

conservative and now well assuming that

3256
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:16,000
conservative and now well assuming that
 

3257
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,590
conservative and now well assuming that
c is less than K I can just keep going

3258
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:17,600
c is less than K I can just keep going
 

3259
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,829
c is less than K I can just keep going
back and forth along this Edge as many

3260
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:18,839
back and forth along this Edge as many
 

3261
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:22,030
back and forth along this Edge as many
times I want and this is for free right

3262
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:22,040
times I want and this is for free right
 

3263
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,030
times I want and this is for free right
because every time I get to the end of

3264
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
because every time I get to the end of
 

3265
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,430
because every time I get to the end of
The Edge I throw all my critters away um

3266
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,440
The Edge I throw all my critters away um
 

3267
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,990
The Edge I throw all my critters away um
so that's an example of a cycle in My

3268
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:27,000
so that's an example of a cycle in My
 

3269
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,390
so that's an example of a cycle in My
Graph and because there's a cycle I'm

3270
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:29,400
Graph and because there's a cycle I'm
 

3271
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,669
Graph and because there's a cycle I'm
not in the the dag case anymore a cycle

3272
01:08:32,669 --> 01:08:32,679
not in the the dag case anymore a cycle
 

3273
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:36,030
not in the the dag case anymore a cycle
in the in the constructed graph sorry

3274
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:36,040
in the in the constructed graph sorry
 

3275
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,829
in the in the constructed graph sorry
yeah it is a cycle here and also a cycle

3276
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
yeah it is a cycle here and also a cycle
 

3277
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,030
yeah it is a cycle here and also a cycle
in the constructed graph

3278
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:40,040
in the constructed graph
 

3279
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,390
in the constructed graph
um yeah sorry I guess that's

3280
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:43,400
um yeah sorry I guess that's
 

3281
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,550
um yeah sorry I guess that's
true all right any other questions I can

3282
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:45,560
true all right any other questions I can
 

3283
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,749
true all right any other questions I can
make a hash of here excellent so am I

3284
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:48,759
make a hash of here excellent so am I
 

3285
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:51,709
make a hash of here excellent so am I
out of time ah Shucks no um okay in that

3286
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:51,719
out of time ah Shucks no um okay in that
 

3287
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:53,950
out of time ah Shucks no um okay in that
case we'll do the last problem here

3288
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:53,960
case we'll do the last problem here
 

3289
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,990
case we'll do the last problem here
actually last problem I think is the

3290
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:55,000
actually last problem I think is the
 

3291
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,789
actually last problem I think is the
most interesting one so as usual I've

3292
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:56,799
most interesting one so as usual I've
 

3293
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,590
most interesting one so as usual I've
left myself with not enough

3294
01:08:59,590 --> 01:08:59,600
left myself with not enough
 

3295
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,590
left myself with not enough
time okay which of these boards is the

3296
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
time okay which of these boards is the
 

3297
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,950
time okay which of these boards is the
tidiest the answer is none of yeah none

3298
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
tidiest the answer is none of yeah none
 

3299
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,349
tidiest the answer is none of yeah none
of the above so let's use the backs

3300
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
of the above so let's use the backs
 

3301
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,669
of the above so let's use the backs
here um

3302
01:09:12,669 --> 01:09:12,679
here um
 

3303
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:16,229
here um
okay right so our last problem is a uh

3304
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:16,239
okay right so our last problem is a uh
 

3305
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:18,789
okay right so our last problem is a uh
shipping problem not a trans shipment

3306
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:18,799
shipping problem not a trans shipment
 

3307
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,829
shipping problem not a trans shipment
problem which happens to be my area of

3308
01:09:20,829 --> 01:09:20,839
problem which happens to be my area of
 

3309
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:24,430
problem which happens to be my area of
research but rather uh just uh a a good

3310
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:24,440
research but rather uh just uh a a good
 

3311
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,189
research but rather uh just uh a a good
old uh shipping thing so here

3312
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:28,199
old uh shipping thing so here
 

3313
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:31,430
old uh shipping thing so here
um Strangely I did not give myself my

3314
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:31,440
um Strangely I did not give myself my
 

3315
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,309
um Strangely I did not give myself my
complete notes so this will be fun um

3316
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:35,319
complete notes so this will be fun um
 

3317
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:37,510
complete notes so this will be fun um
right so I'm trying to ship servers from

3318
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:37,520
right so I'm trying to ship servers from
 

3319
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,870
right so I'm trying to ship servers from
San Francisco to Cambridge by truck and

3320
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:39,880
San Francisco to Cambridge by truck and
 

3321
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,590
San Francisco to Cambridge by truck and
I have all these bunch of third-party

3322
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:41,600
I have all these bunch of third-party
 

3323
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,229
I have all these bunch of third-party
companies that all have pairs of cities

3324
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:44,239
companies that all have pairs of cities
 

3325
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:45,950
companies that all have pairs of cities
that they can ship between and only so

3326
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:45,960
that they can ship between and only so
 

3327
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,390
that they can ship between and only so
much these companies are kind of Divas

3328
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:47,400
much these companies are kind of Divas
 

3329
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,789
much these companies are kind of Divas
they have a weight limit they only have

3330
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:48,799
they have a weight limit they only have
 

3331
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,789
they have a weight limit they only have
like cities they're directed edges I

3332
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:50,799
like cities they're directed edges I
 

3333
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,590
like cities they're directed edges I
can't like they don't drive their trucks

3334
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:52,600
can't like they don't drive their trucks
 

3335
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,350
can't like they don't drive their trucks
back apparently or maybe they like pick

3336
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:54,360
back apparently or maybe they like pick
 

3337
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,510
back apparently or maybe they like pick
up somebody else's stuff and they're

3338
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:55,520
up somebody else's stuff and they're
 

3339
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,390
up somebody else's stuff and they're
just picking your stuff up in the boring

3340
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:57,400
just picking your stuff up in the boring
 

3341
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,550
just picking your stuff up in the boring
direction or or whatever uh so I have a

3342
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:00,560
direction or or whatever uh so I have a
 

3343
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:06,870
direction or or whatever uh so I have a
bunch of I have N Trucking

3344
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:06,880

01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,750
of uh every shipping route every
Trucking route here this is the Target

3356
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:29,760
Trucking route here this is the Target
 

3357
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,910
Trucking route here this is the Target
right so this is like where the truck

3358
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:30,920
right so this is like where the truck
 

3359
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,189
right so this is like where the truck
starts this is where the truck

3360
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:34,199

 

3361
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:38,709

ends this is the max

3362
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:38,719
ends this is the max
 

3363
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,110
ends this is the max
weight that the truck can handle so like

3364
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:41,120
weight that the truck can handle so like
 

3365
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,350
weight that the truck can handle so like
the truck only has so much space in it

3366
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:43,360
the truck only has so much space in it
 

3367
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,590
the truck only has so much space in it
uh you know the tires are only so big uh

3368
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:46,600
uh you know the tires are only so big uh
 

3369
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,070
uh you know the tires are only so big uh
if I put something of of weight bigger

3370
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:48,080
if I put something of of weight bigger
 

3371
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,430
if I put something of of weight bigger
than W uh then my my truck is is going

3372
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:50,440
than W uh then my my truck is is going
 

3373
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,990
than W uh then my my truck is is going
to die so that's the most that I can put

3374
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:52,000
to die so that's the most that I can put
 

3375
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,270
to die so that's the most that I can put
on this truck and this is the

3376
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:55,280
on this truck and this is the
 

3377
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,030
on this truck and this is the
cost okay and I have uh end roots that

3378
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:58,040
cost okay and I have uh end roots that
 

3379
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,470
cost okay and I have uh end roots that
look like this I'm trying to ship

3380
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:00,480
look like this I'm trying to ship
 

3381
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,189
look like this I'm trying to ship
servers and of course some of my servers

3382
01:11:02,189 --> 01:11:02,199
servers and of course some of my servers
 

3383
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:03,990
servers and of course some of my servers
are are too darn busy but we make an

3384
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:04,000
are are too darn busy but we make an
 

3385
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,030
are are too darn busy but we make an
assumption here which is that our

3386
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,040
assumption here which is that our
 

3387
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,990
assumption here which is that our
Trucking routes form a uh sort of a

3388
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:07,000
Trucking routes form a uh sort of a
 

3389
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,630
Trucking routes form a uh sort of a
continuous Network I can get from s tot

3390
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:09,640
continuous Network I can get from s tot
 

3391
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,470
continuous Network I can get from s tot
and ship at the very least like a pencil

3392
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:11,480
and ship at the very least like a pencil
 

3393
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,950
and ship at the very least like a pencil
eraser you know like some minimal amount

3394
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:12,960
eraser you know like some minimal amount
 

3395
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,990
eraser you know like some minimal amount
of weight okay and so the basic uh end

3396
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:18,000
of weight okay and so the basic uh end
 

3397
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,590
of weight okay and so the basic uh end
point of this problem is going to be uh

3398
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:20,600
point of this problem is going to be uh
 

3399
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,189
point of this problem is going to be uh
to sort of figure out the heaviest thing

3400
01:11:22,189 --> 01:11:22,199
to sort of figure out the heaviest thing
 

3401
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:25,669
to sort of figure out the heaviest thing
that I can ship uh and and uh we we give

3402
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
that I can ship uh and and uh we we give
 

3403
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,470
that I can ship uh and and uh we we give
you a problem on the uh sort of on the

3404
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:27,480
you a problem on the uh sort of on the
 

3405
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,470
you a problem on the uh sort of on the
path toward that uh to help prove a

3406
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:29,480
path toward that uh to help prove a
 

3407
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,950
path toward that uh to help prove a
little bit about this this is a very

3408
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:30,960
little bit about this this is a very
 

3409
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,030
little bit about this this is a very
typical kind of setup so again I've got

3410
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,040
typical kind of setup so again I've got
 

3411
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,830
typical kind of setup so again I've got
a bunch of trucking routs each one of

3412
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:36,840
a bunch of trucking routs each one of
 

3413
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,830
a bunch of trucking routs each one of
which has a max weight and I'm going to

3414
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:38,840
which has a max weight and I'm going to
 

3415
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,870
which has a max weight and I'm going to
want to know first of all what's the

3416
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:39,880
want to know first of all what's the
 

3417
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,070
want to know first of all what's the
maximum amount of weight I can ship and

3418
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:42,080
maximum amount of weight I can ship and
 

3419
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,030
maximum amount of weight I can ship and
then what is the minimum cost I can ship

3420
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:44,040
then what is the minimum cost I can ship
 

3421
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,350
then what is the minimum cost I can ship
that that

3422
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,360
that that
 

3423
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,470
that that
weight so in problem a which is marked

3424
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
weight so in problem a which is marked
 

3425
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,070
weight so in problem a which is marked
as useful

3426
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:50,080
as useful

as useful
digression um we're first going to prove

3428
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:52,280
digression um we're first going to prove
 

3429
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,310
digression um we're first going to prove
kind of a handy uh in equality I decided

3430
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:55,320
kind of a handy uh in equality I decided
 

3431
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,070
kind of a handy uh in equality I decided
to go off book with my proof ever so

3432
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:57,080
to go off book with my proof ever so
 

3433
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,030
to go off book with my proof ever so
slightly of this so get excited uh for

3434
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,040
slightly of this so get excited uh for
 

3435
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,430
slightly of this so get excited uh for
this to be slightly uh wrong in a subtle

3436
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
this to be slightly uh wrong in a subtle
 

3437
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,790
this to be slightly uh wrong in a subtle
way which is what I specialize in um but

3438
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:04,800
way which is what I specialize in um but
 

3439
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,830
way which is what I specialize in um but
in particular uh we're going to make a a

3440
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:06,840
in particular uh we're going to make a a
 

3441
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,950
in particular uh we're going to make a a
definition here so let's say that Pi is

3442
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:09,960
definition here so let's say that Pi is
 

3443
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,830
definition here so let's say that Pi is
a

3444
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:12,840

 

3445
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,950

weighted

3446
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
weighted
 

3447
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:21,950
weighted
path okay then uh the bottleneck of

3448
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:21,960

 

3449
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:27,510

Pi of Pi is going to be uh the the

3450
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:27,520
Pi of Pi is going to be uh the the
 

3451
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,950
Pi of Pi is going to be uh the the
minimum Edge

3452
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:30,960

01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:40,800
pi and to make sure that we see how this
 

3457
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,790
pi and to make sure that we see how this
is connected to the problem um you know

3458
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:42,800
is connected to the problem um you know
 

3459
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,390
is connected to the problem um you know
if I'm trying to ship a server and I

3460
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:44,400
if I'm trying to ship a server and I
 

3461
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,709
if I'm trying to ship a server and I
have to put on truck one and truck two

3462
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:45,719
have to put on truck one and truck two
 

3463
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:47,030
have to put on truck one and truck two
and truck three and truck four and truck

01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:54,760
the small is the only one that matters
 

3471
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,990
the small is the only one that matters
in terms of the heaviest thing that I

given a directed graph uh and two
 

3479
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,310
given a directed graph uh and two
vertices s and t we're going to define a

3480
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:07,320
vertices s and t we're going to define a
 

3481
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,590
vertices s and t we're going to define a
quantity called B of s comma

3482
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:10,600
quantity called B of s comma
 

3483
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,070
quantity called B of s comma
T and we're going to say that this is

01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,070
from pass to T of the
bottleneck

3492
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080

 

3493
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,830

of Pi okay so so to sanity check this

3494
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:28,840
of Pi okay so so to sanity check this
 

3495
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,189
of Pi okay so so to sanity check this
quantity here essentially what it's

3496
01:13:30,189 --> 01:13:30,199
quantity here essentially what it's
 

3497
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:31,189
quantity here essentially what it's
saying is at the end of the day I have

3498
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
saying is at the end of the day I have
 

3499
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,870
saying is at the end of the day I have
this big network of trucking routes I

3500
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:33,880
this big network of trucking routes I
 

3501
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,310
this big network of trucking routes I
just want to go from one city to another

3502
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:35,320
just want to go from one city to another
 

3503
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,149
just want to go from one city to another
and I don't care which series of trucks

3504
01:13:37,149 --> 01:13:37,159
and I don't care which series of trucks
 

3505
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:38,750
and I don't care which series of trucks
I want to use I just want to maximize

3506
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:38,760
I want to use I just want to maximize
 

3507
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,470
I want to use I just want to maximize
the weight that I could ship right and

3508
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:41,480
the weight that I could ship right and
 

3509
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:42,950
the weight that I could ship right and
so this is saying I'm going to look at

3510
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:42,960
so this is saying I'm going to look at
 

3511
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,149
so this is saying I'm going to look at
all the different paths that I could

3512
01:13:45,149 --> 01:13:45,159
all the different paths that I could
 

3513
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:48,070
all the different paths that I could

3561
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,669
all uh V in I of T so let's see what
this is saying so remember that this is

01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:57,679
this is saying so remember that this is
 

3563
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,709
this is saying so remember that this is
like the capacity that I can ship from s

3569
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,950
upper bounds the minimum of two things
right either the capacity of shipping to

from that neighbor to me notice this is

3576
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:17,199
from that neighbor to me notice this is
 

3577
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,990
from that neighbor to me notice this is
kind of similar to a triangle inequality

3578
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:20,000
kind of similar to a triangle inequality
 

3579
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,310
kind of similar to a triangle inequality
which is why we're going to kind of know

3580
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:21,320
which is why we're going to kind of know
 

3581
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,669
which is why we're going to kind of know
how to solve Part B of this problem

3582
01:15:22,669 --> 01:15:22,679
how to solve Part B of this problem
 

3583
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:25,030
how to solve Part B of this problem
pretty easily

3584
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
pretty easily
 

3585
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:31,270
pretty easily
okay um and moreover uh

3586
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:31,280

 

3587
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,470

with uh

3588
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:35,480

 

3589
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:39,790

01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:43,560
some V Star in
 

3593
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,830
some V Star in
if

3594
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
if
 

3595
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,830
if
okay guess what that VAR star is going

3596
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
okay guess what that VAR star is going
 

3597
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,790
okay guess what that VAR star is going
to be it's going to be the vertex that's

3598
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:50,800
to be it's going to be the vertex that's
 

3599
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,629
to be it's going to be the vertex that's
sort of the previous one on the path of

3600
01:15:52,629 --> 01:15:52,639
sort of the previous one on the path of
 

3601
01:15:52,639 --> 01:15:55,189
sort of the previous one on the path of
of of of of trucks that I actually take

3602
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:55,199
of of of of trucks that I actually take
 

3603
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:58,750
of of of of trucks that I actually take
to ship stuff right okay so how could we

3604
01:15:58,750 --> 01:15:58,760
to ship stuff right okay so how could we
 

3605
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,629
to ship stuff right okay so how could we
prove this so the intuition here is that

3606
01:16:00,629 --> 01:16:00,639
prove this so the intuition here is that
 

3607
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,550
prove this so the intuition here is that
the path that's actually giving you this

3608
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:02,560
the path that's actually giving you this
 

3609
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,990
the path that's actually giving you this
bottleneck this BS comma T has to

01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:05,000
bottleneck this BS comma T has to
 

3611
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,709
bottleneck this BS comma T has to
include one of my incoming edges and I'm

3612
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
include one of my incoming edges and I'm
 

3613
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:07,910
include one of my incoming edges and I'm
just trying to find it right that's

3614
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:07,920
just trying to find it right that's
 

3615
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,149
just trying to find it right that's
that's roughly what's what's going on in

3616
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:09,159
that's roughly what's what's going on in
 

3617
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:11,070
that's roughly what's what's going on in
this inequality and and by the way

3618
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:11,080
this inequality and and by the way
 

3619
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,390
this inequality and and by the way
whenever a problem asks you to prove an

3620
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:12,400
whenever a problem asks you to prove an
 

3621
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,350
whenever a problem asks you to prove an

01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,830
saying like Okay but like what is this
really telling me about life and and and

3630
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:19,840
really telling me about life and and and
 

3631
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,110
really telling me about life and and and
this is a good uh

3632
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:22,120
this is a good uh
 

3633
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,350
this is a good uh
example okay so to that end um I'm going

3634
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:25,360
example okay so to that end um I'm going
 

3635
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,990
example okay so to that end um I'm going
to make a definition which I found to be

3636
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:27,000
to make a definition which I found to be
 

3637
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,470
to make a definition which I found to be
convenient when I was solving this

3638
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,480
convenient when I was solving this
 

3639
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,110
convenient when I was solving this
problem um which is the following I'm

3640
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,120
problem um which is the following I'm
 

3641
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,070
problem um which is the following I'm
going to say that Pi s comma t uh is

3642
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:35,080
going to say that Pi s comma t uh is
 

3643
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,550
going to say that Pi s comma t uh is
going to be the actual path uh that

3644
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:37,560
going to be the actual path uh that
 

3645
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,990
going to be the actual path uh that
gives me the bottleneck so this is kind

3646
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:39,000
gives me the bottleneck so this is kind
 

3647
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,270
gives me the bottleneck so this is kind
of like the ARG Max over all Pi I'm use

3648
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280
of like the ARG Max over all Pi I'm use
 

3649
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,310
of like the ARG Max over all Pi I'm use
really bad notation Pi is the connect S2

3650
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,320
really bad notation Pi is the connect S2
 

3651
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,229
really bad notation Pi is the connect S2
T that's how we're going to think of

3652
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:50,239
T that's how we're going to think of
 

3653
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,070
T that's how we're going to think of
that of the

3654
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,080
that of the
 

3655
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,830
that of the
bottleneck

3656
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:56,840

 

3657
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,590

so in other words

3658
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:58,600
so in other words
 

3659
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,950
so in other words
like this is the uh path that actually

3660
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:01,960
like this is the uh path that actually
 

3661
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,390
like this is the uh path that actually
realizes uh this this quantity B right

3662
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:04,400
realizes uh this this quantity B right
 

3663
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:12,430
realizes uh this this quantity B right
so in other words B of s t is equal to

3664
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:12,440

 

3665
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,510

bottleneck Pi only has two lines has two

3666
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:15,520
bottleneck Pi only has two lines has two
 

3667
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,030
bottleneck Pi only has two lines has two
this is convenient for me because the

3668
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,040
this is convenient for me because the
 

3669
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,350
this is convenient for me because the
reasoning about that path uh makes some

3670
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,360
reasoning about that path uh makes some
 

3671
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,830
reasoning about that path uh makes some
sense um okay so now uh we're going to

3672
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:23,840
sense um okay so now uh we're going to
 

3673
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,510
sense um okay so now uh we're going to
prove the inequality first and then we

3674
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:26,520
prove the inequality first and then we
 

3675
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,390
prove the inequality first and then we
may or may not choose prove the equality

3676
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,400
may or may not choose prove the equality
 

3677
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,669
may or may not choose prove the equality
case depending on how I feel okay so uh

3678
01:17:32,669 --> 01:17:32,679
case depending on how I feel okay so uh
 

3679
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:35,149
case depending on how I feel okay so uh
right so let's section this off try and

3680
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:35,159
right so let's section this off try and
 

3681
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:36,030
right so let's section this off try and
use my board a little more

3682
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:36,040
use my board a little more
 

3683
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,390
use my board a little more
conservatively

3684
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:37,400
conservatively
 

3685
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,590
conservatively
here uh

3686
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:39,600
here uh
 

3687
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,830
here uh
okay so right so now let's

3688
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:43,840
okay so right so now let's
 

3689
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,430
okay so right so now let's
take a Vertex uh

3690
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:46,440
take a Vertex uh
 

3691
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,709
take a Vertex uh
V from the

3692
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719
V from the
 

3693
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,990
V from the
incoming uh edges here of

3694
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,000
incoming uh edges here of
 

3695
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,229
incoming uh edges here of
t right because that's what we need to

3696
01:17:54,229 --> 01:17:54,239
t right because that's what we need to
 

3697
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,390
t right because that's what we need to
to prove this and we're just going to

3698
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:55,400
to prove this and we're just going to
 

3699
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,629
to prove this and we're just going to
prove the inequality directly here uh in

3700
01:17:58,629 --> 01:17:58,639
prove the inequality directly here uh in
 

3701
01:17:58,639 --> 01:18:00,270
prove the inequality directly here uh in
particular

3702
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:00,280
particular
 

3703
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,189
particular
um we can

3704
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:03,199
um we can
 

3705
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,270
um we can
define a path that goes from s to T as

3706
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:06,280
define a path that goes from s to T as
 

3707
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:11,590
define a path that goes from s to T as
follows I could take the uh Pi

3708
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:11,600
follows I could take the uh Pi
 

3709
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,510
follows I could take the uh Pi
SV and then concatenate onto the end of

3710
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:14,520
SV and then concatenate onto the end of
 

3711
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,669
SV and then concatenate onto the end of
this

3712
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
this
 

3713
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:20,790
this
guy um T right because we know that

3714
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:20,800
guy um T right because we know that
 

3715
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,950
guy um T right because we know that
there's a directed Edge from V to T by

3716
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:22,960
there's a directed Edge from V to T by
 

3717
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,669
there's a directed Edge from V to T by
definition of of what this I is

3718
01:18:25,669 --> 01:18:25,679
definition of of what this I is
 

3719
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,990
definition of of what this I is
okay um right and so this is kind of

3720
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:29,000
okay um right and so this is kind of
 

3721
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,390
okay um right and so this is kind of
convenient because this is like the

3722
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:30,400
convenient because this is like the
 

3723
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,750
convenient because this is like the
bottleneck path for one of my neighbors

3724
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:32,760
bottleneck path for one of my neighbors
 

3725
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,830
bottleneck path for one of my neighbors
and now I'm just kind of sticking an

3726
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:33,840
and now I'm just kind of sticking an
 

3727
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,270
and now I'm just kind of sticking an
edge on there and we know uh that of

3728
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:36,280
edge on there and we know uh that of
 

3729
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,669
edge on there and we know uh that of
course this is a candidate path to get

3730
01:18:38,669 --> 01:18:38,679
course this is a candidate path to get
 

3731
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:40,470
course this is a candidate path to get
from s but it may not be the one that

3732
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:40,480
from s but it may not be the one that
 

3733
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,550
from s but it may not be the one that
actually achieves the bottleneck

3734
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:43,560
actually achieves the bottleneck
 

3735
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,350
actually achieves the bottleneck
okay right so

3736
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:46,360
okay right so
 

3737
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,310
okay right so
uh yeah uh and let's uh oops let's

3738
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:49,320
uh yeah uh and let's uh oops let's
 

3739
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,229
uh yeah uh and let's uh oops let's
define that to be Pi uh twiddle just for

3740
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
define that to be Pi uh twiddle just for
 

3741
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,669
define that to be Pi uh twiddle just for
for fun I like give things names okay so

3742
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:55,679
for fun I like give things names okay so
 

3743
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,629
for fun I like give things names okay so
what do we know we know that b of s

3744
01:18:59,629 --> 01:18:59,639
what do we know we know that b of s
 

3745
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:04,669
what do we know we know that b of s
comma T well this by definition is the

3746
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:04,679
comma T well this by definition is the
 

3747
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:08,550
comma T well this by definition is the
max

3748
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:08,560

 

3749
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,910

bottleneck of any incoming path going

3750
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:11,920
bottleneck of any incoming path going
 

3751
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,669
bottleneck of any incoming path going
from s to

3752
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
from s to
 

3753
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:18,470
from s to
T this is a path from s to T yeah so

3754
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,480
T this is a path from s to T yeah so
 

3755
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,390
T this is a path from s to T yeah so
because this is the max it is bigger

3756
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,400
because this is the max it is bigger
 

3757
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,870
because this is the max it is bigger
than or equal to bottleneck

3758
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:25,880

 

3759
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,310

of Pi twiddle right that's the nice

3760
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,320
of Pi twiddle right that's the nice
 

3761
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,709
of Pi twiddle right that's the nice
thing about Maxes they tend to be bigger

3762
01:19:29,709 --> 01:19:29,719
thing about Maxes they tend to be bigger
 

3763
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:30,870
thing about Maxes they tend to be bigger
than other

3764
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
than other
 

3765
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,110
than other
stuff okay uh well what is the

3766
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:34,120
stuff okay uh well what is the
 

3767
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,430
stuff okay uh well what is the
bottleneck of Pi twiddle well remember

3768
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:36,440
bottleneck of Pi twiddle well remember
 

3769
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,550
bottleneck of Pi twiddle well remember
our definition of bottle bottleneck here

3770
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
our definition of bottle bottleneck here
 

3771
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,790
our definition of bottle bottleneck here
right it's the Min Edge weight over my

3772
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
right it's the Min Edge weight over my
 

3773
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,070
right it's the Min Edge weight over my
entire

3774
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:42,080
entire
 

3775
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,669
entire
path well I have two options either that

3776
01:19:44,669 --> 01:19:44,679
path well I have two options either that
 

3777
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:47,950
path well I have two options either that
edge weight is The Edge from V to T or

3778
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:47,960
edge weight is The Edge from V to T or
 

3779
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,350
edge weight is The Edge from V to T or
it's the edge

3780
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:49,360
it's the edge
 

3781
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,510
it's the edge
we that's associated to the rest of this

3782
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:52,520
we that's associated to the rest of this
 

3783
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:58,790
we that's associated to the rest of this
stuff yeah so either um this is the Min

3784
01:19:58,790 --> 01:19:58,800
stuff yeah so either um this is the Min
 

3785
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,149
stuff yeah so either um this is the Min
of the uh

3786
01:20:03,149 --> 01:20:03,159

 

3787
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:05,470

bottleneck of the first segment of our

3788
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:05,480
bottleneck of the first segment of our
 

3789
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,229
bottleneck of the first segment of our
path Pi SV by the way that may be empty

3790
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
path Pi SV by the way that may be empty
 

3791
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,510
path Pi SV by the way that may be empty
and that's like okay that's just like a

3792
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,520
and that's like okay that's just like a
 

3793
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,350
and that's like okay that's just like a
one Edge path you can dispense with that

3794
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
one Edge path you can dispense with that
 

3795
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:16,709
one Edge path you can dispense with that
case pretty easily uh or the weight of

3796
01:20:16,709 --> 01:20:16,719
case pretty easily uh or the weight of
 

3797
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,470
case pretty easily uh or the weight of
VT

3798
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
VT
 

3799
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,310
VT
cool well by definition bottl neck of Pi

3800
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:22,320
cool well by definition bottl neck of Pi
 

3801
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,950
cool well by definition bottl neck of Pi
SV

3802
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:23,960
SV
 

3803
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,830
SV
is exactly this quantity right because

3804
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
is exactly this quantity right because
 

3805
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,790
is exactly this quantity right because
that's what I chose it to be over here

3806
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:27,800
that's what I chose it to be over here
 

3807
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,709
that's what I chose it to be over here
yeah so this is exactly Min the b s

3808
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:32,719
yeah so this is exactly Min the b s
 

3809
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,470
yeah so this is exactly Min the b s
comma V That was supposed to be a v but

3810
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:35,480
comma V That was supposed to be a v but
 

3811
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:43,470
comma V That was supposed to be a v but
I wrote a t or W of V comma T and that

3812
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:43,480
I wrote a t or W of V comma T and that
 

3813
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,550
I wrote a t or W of V comma T and that
is exactly what we wanted to prove yeah

3814
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:45,560
is exactly what we wanted to prove yeah
 

3815
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,550
is exactly what we wanted to prove yeah
so that takes care of our inequality

3816
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:47,560
so that takes care of our inequality
 

3817
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,390
so that takes care of our inequality
case do I want to do the equality

3818
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
case do I want to do the equality
 

3819
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,470
case do I want to do the equality
case I don't think I do yeah so uh it's

3820
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:53,480
case I don't think I do yeah so uh it's
 

3821
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,990
case I don't think I do yeah so uh it's
not too hard to check the equality case

3822
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:55,000
not too hard to check the equality case
 

3823
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,870
not too hard to check the equality case
essentially you you can make a pretty

3824
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:56,880
essentially you you can make a pretty
 

3825
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,030
essentially you you can make a pretty
easy contradiction right because if it's

3826
01:20:59,030 --> 01:20:59,040
easy contradiction right because if it's
 

3827
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,030
easy contradiction right because if it's
strictly larger then what does that mean

3828
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,040
strictly larger then what does that mean
 

3829
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,310
strictly larger then what does that mean
that means that every single incoming

3830
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:03,320
that means that every single incoming
 

3831
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,590
that means that every single incoming
Edge none of them can be the edge where

3832
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
Edge none of them can be the edge where
 

3833
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,030
Edge none of them can be the edge where
your bottleneck path comes in and

3834
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,040
your bottleneck path comes in and
 

3835
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,830
your bottleneck path comes in and
obviously there's something wrong with

3836
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:08,840
obviously there's something wrong with
 

3837
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,350
obviously there's something wrong with
that uh okay so I'll refer you guys to

3838
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:11,360
that uh okay so I'll refer you guys to
 

3839
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,229
that uh okay so I'll refer you guys to
the uh the notes for that one and

3840
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:14,239
the uh the notes for that one and
 

3841
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:17,870
the uh the notes for that one and
finally uh the problem says uh assuming

3842
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:17,880
finally uh the problem says uh assuming
 

3843
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,229
finally uh the problem says uh assuming
that

3844
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:20,239
that
 

3845
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,709
that
uh so now we have kind of a funny

3846
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:22,719
uh so now we have kind of a funny
 

3847
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,110
uh so now we have kind of a funny
constant in here just to make your life

3848
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:24,120
constant in here just to make your life
 

3849
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,270
constant in here just to make your life
a little bit annoying we have

3850
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,280
a little bit annoying we have
 

3851
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:32,350
a little bit annoying we have
um at most three Square Ro TN

3852
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:32,360
um at most three Square Ro TN
 

3853
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,669
um at most three Square Ro TN
cities that we care about um again why

3854
01:21:36,669 --> 01:21:36,679
cities that we care about um again why
 

3855
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:39,750
cities that we care about um again why
three why not uh I think uh and what we

3856
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:39,760
three why not uh I think uh and what we
 

3857
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,790
three why not uh I think uh and what we
want is the weight of the single uh

3858
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
want is the weight of the single uh
 

3859
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,350
want is the weight of the single uh
largest server and the minimum cost to

3860
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360
largest server and the minimum cost to
 

3861
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,470
largest server and the minimum cost to
ship uh that thing so we want one the

3862
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
ship uh that thing so we want one the
 

3863
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,629
ship uh that thing so we want one the
largest weight we can

3864
01:21:51,629 --> 01:21:51,639

 

3865
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:53,990

ship

3866
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
ship
 

3867
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,750
ship
we'll call that W star to ship and two

3868
01:21:59,750 --> 01:21:59,760
we'll call that W star to ship and two
 

3869
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,669
we'll call that W star to ship and two
is the

3870
01:22:02,669 --> 01:22:02,679

 

3871
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:08,709

smallest cost um to ship that weigh W

3872
01:22:08,709 --> 01:22:08,719
smallest cost um to ship that weigh W
 

3873
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,070
smallest cost um to ship that weigh W
star

3874
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,080
star
 

3875
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,830
star
okay so let's do two first because it's

3876
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:13,840
okay so let's do two first because it's
 

3877
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,790
okay so let's do two first because it's
easy so let's say that I was able to

3878
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:15,800
easy so let's say that I was able to
 

3879
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,669
easy so let's say that I was able to
compute W

3880
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:17,679
compute W
 

3881
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,910
compute W
star so now what can I do well I can

3882
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:20,920
star so now what can I do well I can
 

3883
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,270
star so now what can I do well I can
construct a graph by only keep around

3884
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:24,280
construct a graph by only keep around
 

3885
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,750
construct a graph by only keep around
the the the trucks that can ship at most

3886
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:27,760
the the the trucks that can ship at most
 

3887
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,590
the the the trucks that can ship at most
at least this amount of weight because

3888
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:29,600
at least this amount of weight because
 

3889
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,669
at least this amount of weight because
the other ships are I really want them

3890
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
the other ships are I really want them
 

3891
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,750
the other ships are I really want them
to be boats in this problem but the the

3892
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:33,760
to be boats in this problem but the the
 

3893
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,030
to be boats in this problem but the the
other trucks uh are are useless right if

3894
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:36,040
other trucks uh are are useless right if
 

3895
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,310
other trucks uh are are useless right if
they can't cover W star then they're not

3896
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:38,320
they can't cover W star then they're not
 

3897
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,430
they can't cover W star then they're not
pulling their weight yeah so to do

3898
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,440
pulling their weight yeah so to do
 

3899
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,070
pulling their weight yeah so to do
uh part two

3900
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,080
uh part two
 

3901
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,590
uh part two
here what can I do um I can make a new

3902
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:47,600
here what can I do um I can make a new
 

3903
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:54,189
here what can I do um I can make a new
graph uh G Sub C with a vertex

3904
01:22:54,189 --> 01:22:54,199
graph uh G Sub C with a vertex
 

3905
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:56,229

01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:09,920

 

3911
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:16,390

sorry per uh shipping route uh with

3912
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:16,400
sorry per uh shipping route uh with
 

3913
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,709
sorry per uh shipping route uh with
um this is going to be an unfortunate

3914
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:18,719
um this is going to be an unfortunate
 

3915
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,750
um this is going to be an unfortunate
clash in terminology I'm going to say

3916
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:20,760
clash in terminology I'm going to say
 

3917
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:27,790
clash in terminology I'm going to say
Edge weight to refer to the edge in My

3918
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:27,800

 

3919
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,910

Graph and that's going to be equal to

3920
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
Graph and that's going to be equal to
 

3921
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,149
Graph and that's going to be equal to
the cost of the edge

3922
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:33,159
the cost of the edge
 

3923
01:23:33,159 --> 01:23:37,390
the cost of the edge
um uh and only keep around

3924
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:37,400
um uh and only keep around
 

3925
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:41,149
um uh and only keep around
uh but only for

3926
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:41,159

 

3927
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:45,270

roots that can carry at least

3928
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,280
roots that can carry at least
 

3929
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,430
roots that can carry at least
um W star amount of

3930
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:48,440
um W star amount of
 

3931
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,910
um W star amount of
weight and now what do we do well it's

3932
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:50,920
weight and now what do we do well it's
 

3933
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,590
weight and now what do we do well it's
the shortest path right at this Point um

3934
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
the shortest path right at this Point um
 

3935
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,070
the shortest path right at this Point um
you know shortest path which is really

3936
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:55,080
you know shortest path which is really
 

3937
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,750
you know shortest path which is really
the minimum cost in this case because

3938
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:56,760
the minimum cost in this case because
 

3939
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,870
the minimum cost in this case because
that's what we're associating to the

3940
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:57,880
that's what we're associating to the
 

3941
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,709
that's what we're associating to the
edges um is going to give me the cost of

3942
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
edges um is going to give me the cost of
 

3943
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,669
edges um is going to give me the cost of
shipping wstar in my network I think

3944
01:24:02,669 --> 01:24:02,679
shipping wstar in my network I think
 

3945
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:04,110
shipping wstar in my network I think
that's pretty obvious from this

3946
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:04,120
that's pretty obvious from this
 

3947
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:09,830
that's pretty obvious from this
construction um so that's drra d i j k s

3948
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:09,840
construction um so that's drra d i j k s
 

3949
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,750
construction um so that's drra d i j k s
t r

3950
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
t r
 

3951
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,990
t r
a and now the only question is how much

3952
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,000
a and now the only question is how much
 

3953
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,390
a and now the only question is how much
time does it take so let's say that I do

3954
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:16,400
time does it take so let's say that I do
 

3955
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,310
time does it take so let's say that I do
the brain dead version of dyra where I

3956
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,320
the brain dead version of dyra where I
 

3957
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,470
the brain dead version of dyra where I
just use a direct access array to do my

3958
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:20,480
just use a direct access array to do my
 

3959
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,709
just use a direct access array to do my
priority CU so if you call that'll take

3960
01:24:23,709 --> 01:24:23,719
priority CU so if you call that'll take
 

3961
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:30,189
priority CU so if you call that'll take
Big O of mod V cubed here squared

3962
01:24:30,189 --> 01:24:30,199
Big O of mod V cubed here squared
 

3963
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:32,669
Big O of mod V cubed here squared
squared yep you're right sorry I was

3964
01:24:32,669 --> 01:24:32,679
squared yep you're right sorry I was
 

3965
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:35,950
squared yep you're right sorry I was
thinking Johnson's algorithm okay well

3966
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:35,960
thinking Johnson's algorithm okay well
 

3967
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:39,470
thinking Johnson's algorithm okay well
in this case how big is V well it's

3968
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:39,480
in this case how big is V well it's
 

3969
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,590
in this case how big is V well it's
square root of n 3 * square root of n at

3970
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:42,600
square root of n 3 * square root of n at
 

3971
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,750
square root of n 3 * square root of n at
most so of course v^2 uh is really big O

3972
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:46,760
most so of course v^2 uh is really big O
 

3973
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,550
most so of course v^2 uh is really big O
of n uh and and and the that part is

3974
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:50,560
of n uh and and and the that part is
 

3975
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,709
of n uh and and and the that part is
solved yeah so really our only uh

3976
01:24:53,709 --> 01:24:53,719
solved yeah so really our only uh
 

3977
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:56,270
solved yeah so really our only uh
remaining problem here is to do part one

3978
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:56,280
remaining problem here is to do part one
 

3979
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,669
remaining problem here is to do part one
and I don't have nearly enough time in

3980
01:24:57,669 --> 01:24:57,679
and I don't have nearly enough time in
 

3981
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:59,229
and I don't have nearly enough time in
fact I'm completely out of time so maybe

3982
01:24:59,229 --> 01:24:59,239
fact I'm completely out of time so maybe
 

3983
01:24:59,239 --> 01:25:00,790
fact I'm completely out of time so maybe
we'll just talk through it really

3984
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:00,800
we'll just talk through it really
 

3985
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,310
we'll just talk through it really
briefly sorry about that um essentially

3986
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:04,320
briefly sorry about that um essentially
 

3987
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,590
briefly sorry about that um essentially
the basic observation here is that the

3988
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:06,600
the basic observation here is that the
 

3989
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,790
the basic observation here is that the
inequality that we proved in part A of

3990
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:08,800
inequality that we proved in part A of
 

3991
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,910
inequality that we proved in part A of
our problem it's kind of like the

3992
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:10,920
our problem it's kind of like the
 

3993
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,109
our problem it's kind of like the
triangle inequality of the bottleneck

3994
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:13,119
triangle inequality of the bottleneck

01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:26,440
the basic assumption here being that
 

4007
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,270
the basic assumption here being that
well my shortest path has to come from

4008
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:28,280
well my shortest path has to come from
 

4009
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,149
well my shortest path has to come from
somewhere right so if I look over all my

4010
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
somewhere right so if I look over all my
 

4011
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,350
somewhere right so if I look over all my
neighbors and then I kind of add in my

4012
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:32,360
neighbors and then I kind of add in my
 

4013
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,830
neighbors and then I kind of add in my
closest The Edge uh or rather you know

4014
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:35,840
closest The Edge uh or rather you know
 

4015
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,750
closest The Edge uh or rather you know
the sum of the path length to the

4016
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:38,760
the sum of the path length to the
 

4017
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,950
the sum of the path length to the
previous vertex plus the edge to me it

4018
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:40,960
previous vertex plus the edge to me it
 

4019
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,390
previous vertex plus the edge to me it
gives the shortest path to me here

4020
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:43,400
gives the shortest path to me here
 

4021
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,990
gives the shortest path to me here
instead of that we're saying the biggest

4022
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:45,000
instead of that we're saying the biggest

instead of that we're saying the biggest
bottleneck path so what do I do I look

4024
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:47,520
bottleneck path so what do I do I look
 

4025
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,350
bottleneck path so what do I do I look
at all of my incoming neighbors I find

4026
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
at all of my incoming neighbors I find
 

4027
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,229
at all of my incoming neighbors I find
the one with the biggest bottleneck

4028
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:51,239
the one with the biggest bottleneck
 

4029
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:52,629
the one with the biggest bottleneck
which is band limited by their

4030
01:25:52,629 --> 01:25:52,639
which is band limited by their

bottleneck plus the bottleneck of the
 

4033
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,109

incoming Edge uh and then I update

4034
01:25:57,109 --> 01:25:57,119
incoming Edge uh and then I update
 

4035
01:25:57,119 --> 01:25:59,669
incoming Edge uh and then I update
myself so the only thing remaining here

4036
01:25:59,669 --> 01:25:59,679
myself so the only thing remaining here
 

4037
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:02,310
myself so the only thing remaining here
is to basically do exactly uh dce's

4038
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,320
is to basically do exactly uh dce's
 

4039
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,750
is to basically do exactly uh dce's
algorithm but rather than updating by

01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:04,760
algorithm but rather than updating by
 

4041
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,830

summing EDG length we update by using

4042
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:06,840
summing EDG length we update by using
 

4043
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,629
summing EDG length we update by using
this formula and essentially everything

4044
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
this formula and essentially everything

board I'll I'll let you guys do that one

4052
01:26:17,149 --> 01:26:17,159
board I'll I'll let you guys do that one
 

4053
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:18,310
board I'll I'll let you guys do that one
at home but I actually think the

4054
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
at home but I actually think the
 

4055
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,709
at home but I actually think the
explanation of the written material is

4056
01:26:19,709 --> 01:26:19,719
explanation of the written material is
 

4057
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:21,709
explanation of the written material is
pretty self-evident for this problem so

4058
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:21,719
pretty self-evident for this problem so
 

4059
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:27,149
pretty self-evident for this problem so
that's probably just as

4060
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:27,159

 

4061
01:26:27,159 --> 01:26:30,159
