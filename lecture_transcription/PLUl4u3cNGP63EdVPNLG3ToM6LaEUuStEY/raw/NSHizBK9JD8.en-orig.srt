the the problem with weighted shortest

74
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
the the problem with weighted shortest
 

75
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,749
the the problem with weighted shortest
paths is if our weights were negative

76
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
paths is if our weights were negative
 

77
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,910
paths is if our weights were negative
and there could exist cycles then we

78
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
and there could exist cycles then we
 

79
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,429
and there could exist cycles then we
could have negative weight cycles and

80
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
could have negative weight cycles and
 

81
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,630
could have negative weight cycles and
that would be

82
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
that would be
 

83
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,230
that would be
more difficult to handle because then

84
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
more difficult to handle because then
 

85
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,830
more difficult to handle because then
you have

86
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
you have
 

87
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,149
you have
vertices where you have an unbounded

88
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159

through

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640

for a shortest path there might not be a

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
for a shortest path there might not be a
 

95
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,109
for a shortest path there might not be a
finite length shortest path so

96
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
finite length shortest path so
 

97
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,870
finite length shortest path so
but in the in the condition where we

98
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
but in the in the condition where we
 

99
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,870
but in the in the condition where we
didn't have cycles in the graph of

100
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
didn't have cycles in the graph of
 

101
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,310
didn't have cycles in the graph of

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,469
so we are also able to do uh
that in linear time by exploiting the

that in linear time by exploiting the
 

109
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,270
that in linear time by exploiting the
fact that our vertices could be ordered

110
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
fact that our vertices could be ordered
 

111
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,910

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
expanded dag that had multiple layers
 

179
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,869
expanded dag that had multiple layers
okay so that's what we've done up until

180
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
okay so that's what we've done up until
 

181
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,149
okay so that's what we've done up until
now

182
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
now
 

183
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,390
now
we've gotten linear for some types of

184
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
we've gotten linear for some types of
 

185
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,550
we've gotten linear for some types of
graphs

186
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
graphs
 

187
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,270
graphs
and we've gotten kind of quadratic v

188
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
and we've gotten kind of quadratic v
 

189
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,270
and we've gotten kind of quadratic v
times e

190
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
times e
 

191
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,070
times e
for

192
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
for
 

193
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,990
for
general graphs ones that could contain

194
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
general graphs ones that could contain
 

195
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,990
general graphs ones that could contain
negative cycles now

196
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
negative cycles now
 

197
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,869
negative cycles now
how

198
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
how
 

199
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,750
how
bad is this well if the graph is sparse

200
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
bad is this well if the graph is sparse
 

201
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,149
bad is this well if the graph is sparse
right if if the number of edges in our

202
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
right if if the number of edges in our
 

203
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,550
right if if the number of edges in our
graph is on the order of v

204
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
graph is on the order of v
 

205
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,110
graph is on the order of v
then this is quadratic time and v right

206
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
then this is quadratic time and v right
 

207
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,910
then this is quadratic time and v right
v squared but if this is

208
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
v squared but if this is
 

209
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,350
v squared but if this is
if it's the graph is dense where we have

210
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
if it's the graph is dense where we have
 

211
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,990
if it's the graph is dense where we have
quadratic limit like the complete graph

212
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
quadratic limit like the complete graph
 

213
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,990
quadratic limit like the complete graph
where every edge is present then we have

214
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
where every edge is present then we have
 

215
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,750
where every edge is present then we have
quadratically many

216
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
quadratically many
 

217
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,390
quadratically many
edges in our graph in v and so this

218
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
edges in our graph in v and so this
 

219
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,229
edges in our graph in v and so this
running time is v cubed

220
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
running time is v cubed
 

221
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,149
running time is v cubed
v cube's not great in terms of its

222
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
v cube's not great in terms of its
 

223
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,070
v cube's not great in terms of its
running time we would like something

224
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
running time we would like something
 

225
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,470
running time we would like something
closer to linear

226
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
closer to linear
 

227
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,069
closer to linear
right and so that's what we're going to

228
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
right and so that's what we're going to
 

229
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,509
right and so that's what we're going to
do

230
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
do
 

231
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,550
do
today

232
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
today
 

233
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,509
today
if we have uh this restriction where we

234
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
if we have uh this restriction where we
 

235
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,150
if we have uh this restriction where we
have non-negative weights we can't have

236
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
have non-negative weights we can't have
 

237
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,230
have non-negative weights we can't have
negative weight cycles

238
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
negative weight cycles
 

239
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,710
negative weight cycles
right and this is a restriction that

240
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
right and this is a restriction that
 

241
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,150
right and this is a restriction that
comes up a lot

242
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
comes up a lot
 

243
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,350
comes up a lot
for many gra graphs you might encounter

244
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
for many gra graphs you might encounter
 

245
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,390
for many gra graphs you might encounter
right a lot of times you're uh you don't

246
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
right a lot of times you're uh you don't
 

247
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,310
right a lot of times you're uh you don't
have both positive and negative weights

248
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
have both positive and negative weights
 

249
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,150
have both positive and negative weights
right i don't have a negative distance

250
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
right i don't have a negative distance
 

251
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,270
right i don't have a negative distance
to my house right

252
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
to my house right
 

253
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,749
to my house right
in any metric we have non-negative

254
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
in any metric we have non-negative
 

255
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,950
in any metric we have non-negative
weights

256
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
weights
 

257
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,710
weights
right so

258
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
right so
 

259
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,790
right so
the these things come up a lot and we

260
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
the these things come up a lot and we
 

261
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,950
the these things come up a lot and we
can actually do quite a bit better since

262
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
can actually do quite a bit better since
 

263
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,030
can actually do quite a bit better since
there are no negative weight cycles we

264
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
there are no negative weight cycles we
 

265
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,230
there are no negative weight cycles we
can get almost linear

266
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
can get almost linear
 

267
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,390
can get almost linear
right it's not going to be quite

268
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
right it's not going to be quite
 

269
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,070
right it's not going to be quite
v plus e

270
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
v plus e
 

271
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,830
v plus e
as you see up here

272
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
as you see up here
 

273
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,350
as you see up here
on the slide we're going to get

274
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
on the slide we're going to get
 

275
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,189
on the slide we're going to get
something very close

276
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
something very close
 

277
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,950
something very close
it's v plus e but on the v term we have

278
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
it's v plus e but on the v term we have
 

279
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,189
it's v plus e but on the v term we have
this logarithmic factor in v which

280
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
this logarithmic factor in v which
 

281
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,430
this logarithmic factor in v which
remember for all intents and purposes

282
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
remember for all intents and purposes
 

283
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,870
remember for all intents and purposes
this log of that thing in real life is

284
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
this log of that thing in real life is
 

285
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,390
this log of that thing in real life is
not going to be bigger than like a

286
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
not going to be bigger than like a
 

287
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,270
not going to be bigger than like a
factor of 30 or something like that

288
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
factor of 30 or something like that
 

289
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,390
factor of 30 or something like that
right

290
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
right
 

291
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,749
right
maybe 60 but it's a it's a small number

292
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
maybe 60 but it's a it's a small number
 

293
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,710
maybe 60 but it's a it's a small number
and so

294
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
and so
 

295
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,629
and so
this is actually pretty good performance

296
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
this is actually pretty good performance
 

297
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,230
this is actually pretty good performance
it's almost linear that's what i'm

298
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
it's almost linear that's what i'm
 

299
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,310
it's almost linear that's what i'm
saying almost linear here and that's

300
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
saying almost linear here and that's
 

301
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,110
saying almost linear here and that's
what we're going to try to do today

302
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
what we're going to try to do today
 

303
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,110
what we're going to try to do today
so

304
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
so
 

305
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,029
so
how do we do this well i'm going to make

306
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
how do we do this well i'm going to make
 

307
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,150
how do we do this well i'm going to make
two observations here first off

308
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
two observations here first off
 

309
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,629
two observations here first off
our idea

310
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
our idea
 

311
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,950
our idea
is going to be to generalize the notion

312
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
is going to be to generalize the notion
 

313
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,350
is going to be to generalize the notion
of bfs right when we had bfs we split up

314
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
of bfs right when we had bfs we split up
 

315
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,790
of bfs right when we had bfs we split up
our graph

316
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800

to solve unweighted short uh solve

318
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
to solve unweighted short uh solve
 

319
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,110
to solve unweighted short uh solve
weighted shortest paths with bfs we

320
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
weighted shortest paths with bfs we
 

321
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,909
weighted shortest paths with bfs we
could take our positive edge weights

322
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
could take our positive edge weights
 

323
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,830
could take our positive edge weights
break them up into individual

324
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
break them up into individual
 

325
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,390
break them up into individual
edges

326
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
edges
 

327
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,590
edges
but if the the total weight of our edges

328
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
but if the the total weight of our edges
 

329
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,110
but if the the total weight of our edges
was large

330
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
was large
 

331
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,950
was large
then we'd have a problem because now

332
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
then we'd have a problem because now
 

333
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,950
then we'd have a problem because now
we've expanded the size of our graph

334
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
we've expanded the size of our graph
 

335
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,950
we've expanded the size of our graph
right this is the same issue that we had

336
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
right this is the same issue that we had
 

337
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,590
right this is the same issue that we had
with something like radix sort where

338
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
with something like radix sort where
 

339
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,749
with something like radix sort where
we don't want our algorithm to run in

340
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
we don't want our algorithm to run in
 

341
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,790
we don't want our algorithm to run in
the size of the numbers in our input

342
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
the size of the numbers in our input
 

343
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,790
the size of the numbers in our input
we want our algorithm to run in the

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
we want our algorithm to run in the

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,430
we want our algorithm to run in the
number of numbers in our input right

346
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
number of numbers in our input right
 

347
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,830
number of numbers in our input right
this is the difference between n and u

348
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
this is the difference between n and u
 

349
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,189
this is the difference between n and u
right uh back when we were talking about

350
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
right uh back when we were talking about
 

351
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,150
right uh back when we were talking about
data structures here

352
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
data structures here
 

353
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,710
data structures here
if the size of our weights are large

354
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
if the size of our weights are large
 

355
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,870
if the size of our weights are large
compared to v and e

356
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
compared to v and e
 

357
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,309
compared to v and e
then

358
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
then
 

359
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,870
then
we can't doing this expansion is going

360
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
we can't doing this expansion is going
 

361
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,589
we can't doing this expansion is going
to be difficult but if we had

362
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
to be difficult but if we had
 

363
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,830
to be difficult but if we had
say some graph

364
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
say some graph
 

365
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,670
say some graph
this is my graph g

366
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
this is my graph g
 

367
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,909
this is my graph g
and we had a source vertex s

368
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
and we had a source vertex s
 

369
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,390
and we had a source vertex s
the idea here

370
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
the idea here
 

371
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,469
the idea here
is going to still be to try to grow

372
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
is going to still be to try to grow
 

373
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,870
is going to still be to try to grow
you know a frontier of increasing

374
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
you know a frontier of increasing
 

375
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,909
you know a frontier of increasing
distance from my source

376
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
distance from my source
 

377
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,870
distance from my source
and try to maintain all of the things

378
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880

 

379
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,230

within a certain distance from my source

380
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
within a certain distance from my source
 

381
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,070
within a certain distance from my source
so that's the idea grow a sphere

382
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
so that's the idea grow a sphere
 

383
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,629
so that's the idea grow a sphere
centered at my source repeatedly explore

384
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
centered at my source repeatedly explore
 

385
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,510
centered at my source repeatedly explore
closer vertices

386
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
closer vertices
 

387
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,749
closer vertices
before i get to further ones but

388
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
before i get to further ones but
 

389
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,270
before i get to further ones but
how can i explore closer vertices

390
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
how can i explore closer vertices
 

391
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,510
how can i explore closer vertices
if i don't know the distances beforehand

392
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
if i don't know the distances beforehand
 

393
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,710
if i don't know the distances beforehand
right

394
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
right
 

395
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,870
right
this is kind of seems like a circular

396
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
this is kind of seems like a circular
 

397
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,189
this is kind of seems like a circular
logic right i'm going to use the

398
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
logic right i'm going to use the
 

399
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,670
logic right i'm going to use the
distance to my things to compute the

400
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
distance to my things to compute the
 

401
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,990
distance to my things to compute the
distances to my things that doesn't work

402
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
distances to my things that doesn't work
 

403
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,670
distances to my things that doesn't work
so well right

404
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
so well right
 

405
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,230
so well right
so how do we do this well the idea here

406
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
so how do we do this well the idea here
 

407
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,070
so how do we do this well the idea here
is to

408
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
is to
 

409
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,309
is to
gradually compute the distances compute

410
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
gradually compute the distances compute
 

411
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,710
gradually compute the distances compute
the distances as we go

412
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
the distances as we go
 

413
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,029
the distances as we go
so that we maintain this property now

414
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
so that we maintain this property now
 

415
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,189
so that we maintain this property now
this property this idea

416
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
this property this idea
 

417
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,629
this property this idea
wouldn't work

418
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
wouldn't work
 

419
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,790
wouldn't work
necessarily in the context of negative

420
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
necessarily in the context of negative
 

421
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,390
necessarily in the context of negative
edge weights

422

423
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,270

then this monotonicity more specifically
 

495
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,750
then this monotonicity more specifically
means that

496
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
means that
 

497
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,550
means that
the shortest path from

right

506
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
right
 

507
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,389
right
how do these relate to each other

508
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
how do these relate to each other
 

509
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,110
how do these relate to each other
if this is along that path

510
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
if this is along that path
 

511
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,990
if this is along that path
then this has to be at least as large

512
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
then this has to be at least as large
 

513
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,110
then this has to be at least as large
as the sub-path right because all of

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
as the sub-path right because all of

these the weight of this path cannot be
 

517
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,790
these the weight of this path cannot be
negative

negative
 

519
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,470

so that's the thing that dijkstra is

520
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
so that's the thing that dijkstra is
 

521
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,990
so that's the thing that dijkstra is
going to exploit

601
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,910

right so here's the idea i'm not going

602
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
right so here's the idea i'm not going
 

603
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,670
right so here's the idea i'm not going
to give you the distances to all these

604
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
to give you the distances to all these
 

605
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,870
to give you the distances to all these
vertices

606
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880

 

607
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,870

instead i'm going to give you the

608
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
instead i'm going to give you the
 

609
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,509
instead i'm going to give you the
order of the vertices in some increasing

610
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
order of the vertices in some increasing
 

611
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,710
order of the vertices in some increasing
distance

612
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
distance
 

613
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,069
distance
from s

614
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
from s
 

615
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,269
from s
okay so basically i'm saying if i had

616
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
okay so basically i'm saying if i had
 

617
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,590
okay so basically i'm saying if i had
some i don't know here's a graph uh

618
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
some i don't know here's a graph uh
 

619
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,350
some i don't know here's a graph uh
let's see if i can remember

620
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
let's see if i can remember
 

621
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,150
let's see if i can remember
okay

622
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160

 

623
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,829

okay and i'm gonna put some edges on

624
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
okay and i'm gonna put some edges on
 

625
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:36,069
okay and i'm gonna put some edges on
here

626
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079

 

627
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,190

okay and i'm going to call these

628
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
okay and i'm going to call these
 

629
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,710
okay and i'm going to call these
vertices

630
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
vertices
 

631
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,350
vertices
0 1 2

632
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
0 1 2
 

633
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,629
0 1 2
3 and 4. okay so here's a graph

634
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639

 

635
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,750

maybe i put some edge weights on here

636
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
maybe i put some edge weights on here
 

637
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,790
maybe i put some edge weights on here
i'm going to say this one is

638
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
i'm going to say this one is
 

639
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,470
i'm going to say this one is
3

640
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
3
 

641
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,629
3
this one is 2

642
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
this one is 2
 

643
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,190
this one is 2
this one is 3 this is

644
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
this one is 3 this is
 

645
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,470
this one is 3 this is
1

646
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
1
 

647
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,870
1
this is 1 this is 0 and this is 0.

648
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
this is 1 this is 0 and this is 0.
 

649
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,750
this is 1 this is 0 and this is 0.
so

650
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
so
 

651
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,949
so
from vertex one two

652
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
from vertex one two
 

653
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,590
from vertex one two
two uh that was a two for

654
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
two uh that was a two for
 

655
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,590
two uh that was a two for
the labeling of that vertex

656
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
the labeling of that vertex
 

657
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,590
the labeling of that vertex
that edge is zero weight okay so here's

658
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
that edge is zero weight okay so here's
 

659
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,190
that edge is zero weight okay so here's
a weighted graph

660
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
a weighted graph
 

661
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,870
a weighted graph
okay and i don't necessarily know

662
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
okay and i don't necessarily know
 

663
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,470
okay and i don't necessarily know
i could use bellman ford to find

664
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
i could use bellman ford to find
 

665
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,350
i could use bellman ford to find
shortest paths from this vertex

666
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
shortest paths from this vertex
 

667
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,790
shortest paths from this vertex
zero

668
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
zero
 

669
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,350
zero
right

670
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360

 

671
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,269

but the idea here is i'm not going to

672
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
but the idea here is i'm not going to
 

673
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,110
but the idea here is i'm not going to
give you shortest paths i'm going to try

674
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
give you shortest paths i'm going to try
 

675
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,110
give you shortest paths i'm going to try
to compute shortest paths but i'm going

676
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
to compute shortest paths but i'm going
 

677
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,629
to compute shortest paths but i'm going
to give you some additional information

678
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
to give you some additional information
 

679
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,790
to give you some additional information
i'm going to give you the order of their

680
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
i'm going to give you the order of their
 

681
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,590
i'm going to give you the order of their
shortest path distance

682
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600

 

683
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,509

684
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
from the source
 

685
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,350
from the source
and i can just i'm going to eyeball this

686
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
and i can just i'm going to eyeball this
 

687
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,310
and i can just i'm going to eyeball this
and say

688
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320

 

689
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,470

i'm going to change this slightly to

690
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
i'm going to change this slightly to
 

691
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,470
i'm going to change this slightly to
make it a little bit more interesting

692
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
make it a little bit more interesting
 

693
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,150
make it a little bit more interesting
i'm going to say this

694
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
i'm going to say this
 

695
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,269
i'm going to say this
is

696
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
is
 

697
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,829
is

698
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
distance 4
 

699
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,710
distance 4
okay

700
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
okay
 

701
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,949
okay
all right so now what we have is

702
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
all right so now what we have is
 

703
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,710
all right so now what we have is
the shortest path distance i'm just

704
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
the shortest path distance i'm just
 

705
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,470
the shortest path distance i'm just
eyeballing this the shortest path

706
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
eyeballing this the shortest path
 

707
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,829
eyeballing this the shortest path
distance

708
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
distance
 

709
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,829
distance
to

710
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839

 

711
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,829

ah bad example

712
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
ah bad example
 

713
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,150
ah bad example
all right so

714
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
all right so
 

715
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,829
all right so
these are the weights

716
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
these are the weights
 

717
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,230
these are the weights
shortest path distance to 3 is going to

718
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
shortest path distance to 3 is going to
 

719
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,629
shortest path distance to 3 is going to
be 2 i'm going to say

720
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
be 2 i'm going to say
 

721
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,550
be 2 i'm going to say
through there

722
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
through there
 

723
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,110
through there
shortest path distance here is two also

724
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
shortest path distance here is two also
 

725
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,430
shortest path distance here is two also
shortest path distance here is also two

726
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
shortest path distance here is also two
 

727
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,790
shortest path distance here is also two
because i can go through both of these

728
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
because i can go through both of these
 

729
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,550
because i can go through both of these
zeros and

730
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
zeros and
 

731
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,710
zeros and
it's not a problem and then the shortest

732
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
it's not a problem and then the shortest
 

733
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,230
it's not a problem and then the shortest
path distance here is two to here and a

734
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
path distance here is two to here and a
 

735
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,030
path distance here is two to here and a
third to there okay so these are

736
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
third to there okay so these are
 

737
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,870
third to there okay so these are
listed in increasing distance

738
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
listed in increasing distance
 

739
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,310
listed in increasing distance
from my source

740
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
from my source
 

741
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,670
from my source
okay i

742
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
okay i
 

743
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,750
okay i
i had to compute those deltas to

744
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
i had to compute those deltas to
 

745
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,189
i had to compute those deltas to
kind of convince you that this is the

746
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
kind of convince you that this is the
 

747
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,430
kind of convince you that this is the
right ordering but this is a right

748
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
right ordering but this is a right
 

749
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,590
right ordering but this is a right
ordering of these things now it's not

750
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
ordering of these things now it's not
 

751
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,509
ordering of these things now it's not
the only right ordering

752
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
the only right ordering
 

753
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,470
the only right ordering
right

754
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
right
 

755
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,350
right
but it is a right order okay so i'm told

756
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
but it is a right order okay so i'm told
 

757
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,110
but it is a right order okay so i'm told
i'm i'm arguing to you that i could

758
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
i'm i'm arguing to you that i could
 

759
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,350
i'm i'm arguing to you that i could
solve single source shortest paths

760
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
solve single source shortest paths
 

761
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,949
solve single source shortest paths
in linear time

762
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
in linear time
 

763
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,189
in linear time
if i were to give you the vertices in

764
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
if i were to give you the vertices in
 

765
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,110
if i were to give you the vertices in
increasing distance how could i do that

766
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
increasing distance how could i do that
 

767
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,030
increasing distance how could i do that
well

768
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
well
 

769
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,350
well
it because of this first observation

770
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
it because of this first observation
 

771
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,829
it because of this first observation
i know that if these are increasing in

772
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
i know that if these are increasing in
 

773
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,350
i know that if these are increasing in

one exception
 

783
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,509

anyone know what that exception is no no

anyone know what that exception is no no
 

785
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,430
anyone know what that exception is no no
edge can go backwards in this ordering

786
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
edge can go backwards in this ordering
 

787
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,990
edge can go backwards in this ordering
based on this observation

788
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
based on this observation
 

789
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,990
based on this observation
except under what condition

790
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
except under what condition
 

791
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,430
except under what condition
yeah

792
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
yeah
 

793
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,670
yeah
if the weight is zero yeah so if the

794
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
if the weight is zero yeah so if the
 

795
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,670
if the weight is zero yeah so if the
weight is zero just just like this

796
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
weight is zero just just like this
 

797
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,470
weight is zero just just like this
situation here

798
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
situation here
 

799
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,990
situation here
then i could go backwards in the

800
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
then i could go backwards in the
 

801
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,430
then i could go backwards in the
ordering

802
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
ordering
 

803
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,230
ordering
seems problematic right the idea is i'm

804
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
seems problematic right the idea is i'm
 

805
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,110
seems problematic right the idea is i'm
going to want to construct a dag

806
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
going to want to construct a dag
 

807
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,749
going to want to construct a dag
so that i can run dag relaxation

808
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
so that i can run dag relaxation
 

809
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,629
so that i can run dag relaxation
well

810
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
well
 

811
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,030
well
if i have a

812
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
if i have a
 

813
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,949
if i have a
component here

814
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959

 

815
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,069

that has zero weights

816
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
that has zero weights
 

817
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,670
that has zero weights
i can kind of

818
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
i can kind of
 

819
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,310
i can kind of
coalesce this thing down

820
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
coalesce this thing down
 

821
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,550
coalesce this thing down
i can i can deal with this this this

822
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
i can i can deal with this this this
 

823
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,310
i can i can deal with this this this
component separately

824
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
component separately
 

825
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,350
component separately
right

826
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
right
 

827
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,749
right
let's let's worry about that separately

828
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
let's let's worry about that separately
 

829
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,030
let's let's worry about that separately
if we do

830
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
if we do
 

831
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,430
if we do
we can kind of collapse this edge down

832
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
we can kind of collapse this edge down
 

833
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,150
we can kind of collapse this edge down
into a single vertex

834
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
into a single vertex
 

835
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,629
into a single vertex
and transform this graph so it does

836
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
and transform this graph so it does
 

837
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,710
and transform this graph so it does
respect the ordering okay so i'm going

838
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
respect the ordering okay so i'm going
 

839
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,790
respect the ordering okay so i'm going
to transform this

840
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
to transform this
 

841
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,910
to transform this
graph

842
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
graph
 

843
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,189
graph
into

844
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
into
 

845
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,550
into
a new graph

846
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
a new graph
 

847
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,430
a new graph
this is a graph

848
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440

 

849
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,629

contains vertex 2 and vertex 0

850
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
contains vertex 2 and vertex 0
 

851
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,749
contains vertex 2 and vertex 0
vertex

852
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
vertex
 

853
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,150
vertex
1 and 3 here

854
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
1 and 3 here
 

855
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,030
1 and 3 here
and vertex 4.

856
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
and vertex 4.
 

857
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,270
and vertex 4.
okay now we have

858
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
okay now we have
 

859
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,429
okay now we have
uh and i'm only going to keep edges

860
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
uh and i'm only going to keep edges
 

861
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,390
uh and i'm only going to keep edges
going forward in the

862
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400

 

863
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,270

ah

864
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
ah
 

865
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,949
ah
i'm going to need to collapse this

866
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
i'm going to need to collapse this
 

867
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,549
i'm going to need to collapse this
entire section

868
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559

 

869
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,510

right this entire section

870
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
right this entire section
 

871
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,990
right this entire section
down into one vertex this doesn't quite

872
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
down into one vertex this doesn't quite
 

873
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,029
down into one vertex this doesn't quite
work

874
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
work
 

875
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,990
work
okay

876
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
okay
 

877
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,390
okay
let's let's ignore uh

878
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400
let's let's ignore uh
 

879
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,070
let's let's ignore uh
zero weight edges for now let's assume

880
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
zero weight edges for now let's assume
 

881
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:41,350
zero weight edges for now let's assume
these are

882
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360

 

883
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,789

all right there's something broken here

884
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
all right there's something broken here
 

885
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,510
all right there's something broken here
if i have a cycle here

886
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520

 

887
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,310

yeah

888
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
yeah
 

889
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,470
yeah
right now i don't have a cycle of zero

890
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
right now i don't have a cycle of zero
 

891
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,350
right now i don't have a cycle of zero
weight

892
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
weight
 

893
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,190
weight
right so what i could do is i could take

894
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
right so what i could do is i could take
 

895
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,630
right so what i could do is i could take
this vertex

896
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
this vertex
 

897
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,510
this vertex
and put it after both of these vertices

898
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
and put it after both of these vertices
 

899
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,430
and put it after both of these vertices
and now i would or

900
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
and now i would or
 

901
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,350
and now i would or
i could rearrange the order of these

902
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
i could rearrange the order of these
 

903
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,789
i could rearrange the order of these
three vertices where there's a path of

904
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
three vertices where there's a path of
 

905
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,310
three vertices where there's a path of
length zero

906
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
length zero
 

907
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,710
length zero
and get a new ordering that still

908
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
and get a new ordering that still
 

909
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,390
and get a new ordering that still
satisfies the property

910
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
satisfies the property
 

911
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,669
satisfies the property
okay

912
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
okay
 

913
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,669
okay
and that's always the case

914
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
and that's always the case
 

915
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,470
and that's always the case
because uh paths

916
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
because uh paths
 

917
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,270
because uh paths
uh

918
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
uh
 

919
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,190
uh
can't increase

920
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
can't increase
 

921
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,070
can't increase
path can't decrease in in weight i can

922
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
path can't decrease in in weight i can
 

923
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,310
path can't decrease in in weight i can
rearrange the ordering of these things

924
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
rearrange the ordering of these things
 

925
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,350
rearrange the ordering of these things
so that

926
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
so that
 

927
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,750
so that
three comes first

928
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
three comes first
 

929
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,390
three comes first
one comes second and two comes third

930
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
one comes second and two comes third
 

931
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,350
one comes second and two comes third
of those three vertices okay

932
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360

 

933
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,430

yeah so for for every set of

934
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
yeah so for for every set of
 

935
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,470
yeah so for for every set of
uh

936
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
uh
 

937
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,830
uh
zero edges i can just

938
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
zero edges i can just
 

939
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,070
zero edges i can just
flip the relationship if they have the

940
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
flip the relationship if they have the
 

941
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,510
flip the relationship if they have the
same distance okay in my input

942
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
same distance okay in my input
 

943
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,990
same distance okay in my input
i'm given vertices that have the same

944
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
i'm given vertices that have the same
 

945
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,990
i'm given vertices that have the same
distance from the source and so if those

946
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
distance from the source and so if those
 

947
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,750
distance from the source and so if those
are the same distance from the source

948
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
are the same distance from the source
 

949
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,909
are the same distance from the source
and they're connected by zero eight edge

950
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
and they're connected by zero eight edge
 

951
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,350
and they're connected by zero eight edge
it doesn't hurt me to flip their

952
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
it doesn't hurt me to flip their
 

953
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,830
it doesn't hurt me to flip their
ordering so i'm gonna do that okay

954
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
ordering so i'm gonna do that okay
 

955
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,950
ordering so i'm gonna do that okay
so let's

956
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
so let's
 

957
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,630
so let's
convert that into a graph with a

958
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
convert that into a graph with a
 

959
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:12,950
convert that into a graph with a
different ordering

960
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960

 

961
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,270

zero

962
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
zero
 

963
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,950
zero
three now one

964
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
three now one
 

965
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,549
three now one
two

966
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
two
 

967
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,630
two
okay and i have this distance this edge

968
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
okay and i have this distance this edge
 

969
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,230
okay and i have this distance this edge
this edge this edge this edge

970
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240

 

971
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,830

this edge

972
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840

 

973
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,230

what am i missing two to three

974
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240

 

975
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,669

and

976
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
and
 

977
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,390
and
here

978
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
here
 

979
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,669
here
i think i have all of those edges

980
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
i think i have all of those edges
 

981
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,350
i think i have all of those edges
yeah

982
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
yeah
 

983
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,549
yeah
okay

984
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
okay
 

985
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,789
okay
now i have the property that

986
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
now i have the property that
 

987
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,110
now i have the property that
every edge that could participate in the

988
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
every edge that could participate in the
 

989
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,510
every edge that could participate in the
shortest path are going forward in the

990
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
shortest path are going forward in the
 

991
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,549
shortest path are going forward in the
ordering

992
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
ordering
 

993
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,630
ordering
right because

994
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
right because
 

995
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,190
right because
all of these

996
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
all of these
 

997
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,350
all of these
are zero weight

998
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,360
are zero weight
 

999
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,270
are zero weight
so we flip those around so they're going

1000
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
so we flip those around so they're going
 

1001
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,149
so we flip those around so they're going
correct with respect to the ordering

1002
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
correct with respect to the ordering
 

1003
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,350
correct with respect to the ordering
and any

1004
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
and any
 

1005
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,390
and any
edge going backwards that is positive

1006
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
edge going backwards that is positive
 

1007
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,510
edge going backwards that is positive
weight

1008
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
weight
 

1009
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,350
weight
certainly can't be used in any shortest

1010
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
certainly can't be used in any shortest
 

1011
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,070
certainly can't be used in any shortest
path so i'm just going to get rid of

1012
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
path so i'm just going to get rid of
 

1013
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,669
path so i'm just going to get rid of
them

1014
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679

 

1015
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,669

yeah what do i do if there's a zero

1016
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
yeah what do i do if there's a zero
 

1017
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,950
yeah what do i do if there's a zero
weight cycle

1018
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
weight cycle
 

1019
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,789
weight cycle
if there's a zero weight cycle i can

1020
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
if there's a zero weight cycle i can
 

1021
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,350
if there's a zero weight cycle i can
just coalesce them all together down to

1022
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
just coalesce them all together down to
 

1023
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,990
just coalesce them all together down to
a single vertex because if i reach one

1024
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
a single vertex because if i reach one
 

1025
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,230
a single vertex because if i reach one
of them i can reach all of them

1026
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
of them i can reach all of them
 

1027
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,430
of them i can reach all of them
okay

1028
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440

 

1029
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,070

exactly i'm computing a topological so

1030
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
exactly i'm computing a topological so
 

1031
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,669
exactly i'm computing a topological so
the idea here is we're trying to

1032
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
the idea here is we're trying to
 

1033
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,270
the idea here is we're trying to
construct a dag

1034
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
construct a dag
 

1035
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,950
construct a dag
i can construct this dag in linear time

1036
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:42,960
i can construct this dag in linear time
 

1037
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,549
i can construct this dag in linear time
and then i can run

1038
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
and then i can run
 

1039
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,029
and then i can run
dag relaxation on this graph

1040
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
dag relaxation on this graph
 

1041
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,750
dag relaxation on this graph
in linear time to get shortest paths

1042
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:49,760
in linear time to get shortest paths
 

1043
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,789
in linear time to get shortest paths
so that's

1044
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
so that's
 

1045
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,029
so that's
that's an approach if i knew the

1046
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
that's an approach if i knew the
 

1047
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,950
that's an approach if i knew the
ordering of the vertices in increasing

1048
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
ordering of the vertices in increasing
 

1049
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,950
ordering of the vertices in increasing
distance

1050
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
distance
 

1051
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,029
distance
then i could use dag relaxation so we're

1052
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
then i could use dag relaxation so we're
 

1053
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,590
then i could use dag relaxation so we're
going to use both of these observations

1054
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
going to use both of these observations
 

1055
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,750
going to use both of these observations
that's how we're going to solve this uh

1056
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
that's how we're going to solve this uh
 

1057
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,990
that's how we're going to solve this uh
single source shortest problem

1058
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
single source shortest problem
 

1059
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,710
single source shortest problem
with non-negative weights using dijkstra

1060
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
with non-negative weights using dijkstra
 

1061
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,830
with non-negative weights using dijkstra
so that's

1062
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
so that's
 

1063
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,549
so that's
finally now where we're coming to

1064
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
finally now where we're coming to
 

1065
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,789
finally now where we're coming to

now dykstra
 

1097
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,789
now dykstra
was this dutch computer scientist

1098
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
was this dutch computer scientist
 

1099
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,549
was this dutch computer scientist
okay this is him

1100
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
okay this is him
 

1101
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,430
okay this is him
pretty famous he he wrote a monograph on

1102
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
pretty famous he he wrote a monograph on
 

1103
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,390
pretty famous he he wrote a monograph on
why

1104
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
why
 

1105
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,430
why
uh programming languages should uh start

1106
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
uh programming languages should uh start
 

1107
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,549
uh programming languages should uh start
with

1108
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559

so i like him but uh in particular he

1112
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
so i like him but uh in particular he
 

1113
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,950
so i like him but uh in particular he
designed this very nice generalization

1114
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
designed this very nice generalization
 

1115
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,830
designed this very nice generalization
of bfs for weighted graphs

1116
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840

1117
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,149

uh but maybe i didn't spell this right

1118
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
uh but maybe i didn't spell this right
 

1119
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,630
uh but maybe i didn't spell this right
because when he writes his name he

1120
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
because when he writes his name he
 

1121
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,669
because when he writes his name he
writes it with a y with a dash over it

1122
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
writes it with a y with a dash over it
 

1123
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,230
writes it with a y with a dash over it
so

1124
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240

 

1125
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,789

on a dutch typewriter
you might have a a character that looks

1130
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:27,600
you might have a a character that looks
 

1131
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,110
you might have a a character that looks

1139
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,029

this looks

1140
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
this looks
 

1141
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,870
this looks
pretty similar to an ij

1142
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
pretty similar to an ij
 

1143
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,190
pretty similar to an ij
so

1144
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200

 

1145
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,350

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
in a lot of manuscripts
 

1147
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,029
in a lot of manuscripts
we write it as

1148
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
we write it as
 

1149
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,549
we write it as
d i j there's no j sound in dijkstra

1150
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
d i j there's no j sound in dijkstra
 

1151
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,190
d i j there's no j sound in dijkstra
it's coming from this this y here okay

1152
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
it's coming from this this y here okay
 

1153
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,190
it's coming from this this y here okay
so that's a interesting way to remember

1154
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
so that's a interesting way to remember
 

1155
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,510
so that's a interesting way to remember
how to spell dijkstra

1156
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
how to spell dijkstra
 

1157
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,630
how to spell dijkstra
but the basic idea behind dijkstra is

generalize bfs

1186
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,240
generalize bfs
 

1187
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,070
generalize bfs
so how do we know

1188
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
so how do we know
 

1189
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,190
so how do we know

1195
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:55,669

1207
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,510

okay and the data structure we're going

1208
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
okay and the data structure we're going
 

1209
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,149
okay and the data structure we're going
to use is something i like to call

1210
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
to use is something i like to call
 

1211
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:22,470

okay so this is a little different than
 

1215
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,350

1221
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,909

00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
uh unit
 

1223
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,549

this changeable priority queue has three

1224
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
this changeable priority queue has three
 

1225
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,070
this changeable priority queue has three
operations

1226
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
operations
 

1227
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,750
operations
we're going to say it's a

1228
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
we're going to say it's a
 

1229
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,870
we're going to say it's a
queue

1230
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
queue
 

1231
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,669
queue
we can build it

1232
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
we can build it
 

1233
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,149
we can build it
on an iterable set

1234
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
on an iterable set
 

1235
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,070
on an iterable set
of items just

1236
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080
of items just
 

1237
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,029
of items just
stick

1238
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
stick
 

1239
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,549
stick
x uh like n items in there

1240
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
x uh like n items in there
 

1241
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,710
x uh like n items in there
we can

1242
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
we can
 

1243
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,350
we can
delete min

1244
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360

 

1245
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,669

from the queue

1246
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
from the queue
 

1247
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,750
from the queue
okay this is the same now as the

1248
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
okay this is the same now as the
 

1249
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,830
okay this is the same now as the
priority queue it's this third operation

1250
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:07,840
priority queue it's this third operation
 

1251
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,789
priority queue it's this third operation
that's going to be different

1252
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799

 

1253
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,470

decrease

1254
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480

 

1255
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,789

the key

1256
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
the key
 

1257
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,310
the key
of an item that has id id

1258
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
of an item that has id id
 

1259
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,430
of an item that has id id
okay so this is a little strange

1260
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440
okay so this is a little strange
 

1261
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,430
okay so this is a little strange
what the heck is this id

1262
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
what the heck is this id
 

1263
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,350
what the heck is this id
all right with the changeable priority

1264
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
all right with the changeable priority
 

1265
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,310
all right with the changeable priority
queue

1266
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
queue
 

1267
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,029
queue
each of our items has two values instead

1268
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
each of our items has two values instead
 

1269
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,310
each of our items has two values instead
of one value it has a key

1270
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
of one value it has a key
 

1271
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,789
of one value it has a key
but it also on which the priority queue

1272
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
but it also on which the priority queue
 

1273
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,669
but it also on which the priority queue
is

1274
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:39,679
is
 

1275
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,430
is
deleting the min

1276
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440
deleting the min
 

1277
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,710
deleting the min
item

1278
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
item
 

1279
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,950
item
with the minimum key

1280
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
with the minimum key
 

1281
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,830
with the minimum key
but also each item has an id associated

1282
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
but also each item has an id associated
 

1283
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,029
but also each item has an id associated
with it a unique integer

1284
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
with it a unique integer
 

1285
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,190
with it a unique integer
okay so that

1286
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
okay so that
 

1287
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,350
okay so that
when we perform this operation decrease

1288
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,360
when we perform this operation decrease
 

1289
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,630
when we perform this operation decrease
key

1290
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
key
 

1291
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,590
key
it can find some

1292
00:25:59,590 --> 00:25:59,600
it can find some
 

1293
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,390
it can find some
item in our data structure with a given

1294
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
item in our data structure with a given
 

1295
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,510
item in our data structure with a given
id

1296
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,520
id
 

1297
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,430
id
and if it's contained there it's going

1298
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
and if it's contained there it's going
 

1299
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,430
and if it's contained there it's going
to change its

1300
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
to change its
 

1301
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,310
to change its
key

1302
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
key
 

1303
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,350
key
to some smaller value okay

1304
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,360
to some smaller value okay
 

1305
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,390
to some smaller value okay
okay

1306
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
okay
 

1307
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,750
okay
and

1308
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
and
 

1309
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,830
and
don't worry about the edge cases here

1310
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
don't worry about the edge cases here
 

1311
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,750
don't worry about the edge cases here
we're always going to make sure this k

1312
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
we're always going to make sure this k
 

1313
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,310
we're always going to make sure this k
is going to be smaller than whatever

1314
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,320
is going to be smaller than whatever
 

1315
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,950
is going to be smaller than whatever
that key was to begin with all right so

1316
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960
that key was to begin with all right so
 

1317
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,029
that key was to begin with all right so
this is a really a kind of a funky

1318
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
this is a really a kind of a funky
 

1319
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,390
this is a really a kind of a funky
operation

1320
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400

 

1321
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,830

if i had a priority queue

1322
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
if i had a priority queue
 

1323
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,510
if i had a priority queue
not a changeable priority queue but i

1324
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
not a changeable priority queue but i
 

1325
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,269
not a changeable priority queue but i
had a priority queue and i wanted to

1326
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
had a priority queue and i wanted to
 

1327
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,310
had a priority queue and i wanted to
implement a changeable priority queue

1328
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,320
implement a changeable priority queue
 

1329
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,909
implement a changeable priority queue
how could i do it

1330
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919

 

1331
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,789

well

1332
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
well
 

1333
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,630
well
a regular priority queue is already

1334
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
a regular priority queue is already
 

1335
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,590
a regular priority queue is already
going to get me these two operations

1336
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,600
going to get me these two operations
 

1337
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,590
going to get me these two operations
it's just this one i essentially need to

1338
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
it's just this one i essentially need to
 

1339
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,430
it's just this one i essentially need to
find something by a id

1340
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
find something by a id
 

1341
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,230
find something by a id
and then update its key

1342
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
and then update its key
 

1343
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,830
and then update its key
okay so the idea how to implement

1344
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840

 

1345
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,149

this is going to be to use a regular

1346
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
this is going to be to use a regular
 

1347
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,190
this is going to be to use a regular
priority queue

1348
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200

 

1349
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,750

i'm going to call it q prime

1350
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
i'm going to call it q prime
 

1351
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,510
i'm going to call it q prime
and i'm going to cross link it

1352
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520

 

1353
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,510

with a dictionary d

1354
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520

 

1355
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,549

okay

1356
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:30,559
okay
 

1357
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,630
okay
so this is just a regular priority queue

1358
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
so this is just a regular priority queue
 

1359
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,830
so this is just a regular priority queue
on my items that has the key as defined

1360
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
on my items that has the key as defined
 

1361
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,470
on my items that has the key as defined
above right

1362
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:38,480
above right
 

1363
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,230
above right
but i'm going to cross-link it with a

1364
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
but i'm going to cross-link it with a
 

1365
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,789
but i'm going to cross-link it with a
dictionary a dictionary that maps ids

1366
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
dictionary a dictionary that maps ids
 

1367
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,710
dictionary a dictionary that maps ids
to their location in the priority queue

1368
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
to their location in the priority queue
 

1369
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,549
to their location in the priority queue
we've done this many times in the data

1370
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559
we've done this many times in the data
 

1371
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,750
we've done this many times in the data
structures

1372
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
structures
 

1373
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,389
structures
section we're trying to cross-link to

1374
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
section we're trying to cross-link to
 

1375
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,789
section we're trying to cross-link to
data structures to make

1376
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:54,799
data structures to make
 

1377
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,470
data structures to make
a query on a different type of key

1378
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,480
a query on a different type of key
 

1379
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,230
a query on a different type of key
to find its place in another data

1380
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
to find its place in another data
 

1381
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,750
to find its place in another data
structure okay

1382
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:01,760
structure okay
 

1383
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,950
structure okay
so

1384
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
so
 

1385
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,350
so
if we had a priority queue in a

1386
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
if we had a priority queue in a
 

1387
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,789
if we had a priority queue in a
dictionary

1388
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
dictionary
 

1389
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,789
dictionary
we could do this stuff

1390
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:08,799
we could do this stuff
 

1391
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,389
we could do this stuff
pretty fast

1392
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:10,399
pretty fast
 

1393
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,310
pretty fast
okay

1394
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
okay
 

1395
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,310
okay
in particular i'm going to assume that

1396
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,320
in particular i'm going to assume that
 

1397
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,470
in particular i'm going to assume that
our ids of our vertices

1398
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
our ids of our vertices
 

1399
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,549
our ids of our vertices
are the integers between zero and v

1400
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
are the integers between zero and v
 

1401
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,470
are the integers between zero and v
minus one and so for my dictionary

1402
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
minus one and so for my dictionary
 

1403
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,549
minus one and so for my dictionary
i could get constant time looking up of

1404
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
i could get constant time looking up of
 

1405
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,070
i could get constant time looking up of
that id

1406
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
that id
 

1407
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,230
that id
by using what data structure

1408
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240

 

1409
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,549

we could get okay so we could get

1410
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
we could get okay so we could get
 

1411
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,430
we could get okay so we could get
expected constant time

1412
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
expected constant time
 

1413
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,710
expected constant time
if we used a hash table

1414
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
if we used a hash table
 

1415
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,669
if we used a hash table
but if we knew that our

1416
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:43,679
but if we knew that our
 

1417
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,549
but if we knew that our
vertex ids were just the numbers from 0

1418
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
vertex ids were just the numbers from 0
 

1419
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,149
vertex ids were just the numbers from 0
to v minus 1

1420
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
to v minus 1
 

1421
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,110
to v minus 1
we could get a rid of that expected time

1422
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
we could get a rid of that expected time
 

1423
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,630
we could get a rid of that expected time
by using

1424
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
by using
 

1425
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,350
by using
a direct access array

1426
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
a direct access array
 

1427
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,669
a direct access array
great okay so that's what the assumption

1428
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679
great okay so that's what the assumption
 

1429
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,990
great okay so that's what the assumption
and so really the name of the game here

1430
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
and so really the name of the game here
 

1431
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,549
and so really the name of the game here
is to choose a priority queue here

1432
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:04,559
is to choose a priority queue here
 

1433
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,870
is to choose a priority queue here
that's going to make these things fast

1434
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
that's going to make these things fast
 

1435
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,630
that's going to make these things fast
when we start to look at dijkstra okay

1436
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
when we start to look at dijkstra okay
 

1437
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,310
when we start to look at dijkstra okay
so we're going to use this

1438
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
so we're going to use this
 

1439
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,470
so we're going to use this
data structure

1440
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,480
data structure
 

1441
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,669
data structure
to

1442
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
to
 

1443
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,710
to
keep track of

1444
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
keep track of
 

1445
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,029
keep track of
our distance estimates to all of the

1446
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
our distance estimates to all of the
 

1447
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,710
our distance estimates to all of the
vertices

1448
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
vertices
 

1449
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,029
vertices
away from s okay so this is dijkstra's

1450
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:23,039
away from s okay so this is dijkstra's
 

1451
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,029
away from s okay so this is dijkstra's
algorithm

1452
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
algorithm
 

1453
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,750

okay set

1454
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
okay set
 

1455
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,269
okay set
so same initialization step

1456
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
so same initialization step
 

1457
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,990
so same initialization step
we're going to set our this is a

1458
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
we're going to set our this is a
 

1459
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,269
we're going to set our this is a
estimate d not delta

1460
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:37,279
estimate d not delta
 

1461
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,590
estimate d not delta
we're going to want the d's to be our

1462
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
we're going to want the d's to be our
 

1463
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,350
we're going to want the d's to be our
deltas at the end of the algorithm

1464
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
deltas at the end of the algorithm
 

1465
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,269
deltas at the end of the algorithm
that's what we're going to have to prove

1466
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
that's what we're going to have to prove
 

1467
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,750
that's what we're going to have to prove
so we first set all of them to infinity

1468
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,760
so we first set all of them to infinity
 

1469
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,029
so we first set all of them to infinity
and then

1470
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
and then
 

1471
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,950
and then
set

1472
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
set
 

1473
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,590

right
 

1479
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,909
right
and here we're never going to update it

1480

and here we're never going to update it
 

1481
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,750
and here we're never going to update it
again right because

1482
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
again right because
 

1483
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,710
again right because

1578
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
has
 

1579
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,669
has
minimum distance

1580
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679

 

1581
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,350

okay so i'm going to remove i'm going to

1582
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,360
okay so i'm going to remove i'm going to
 

1583
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,789
okay so i'm going to remove i'm going to
look at all the things in my priority

1584
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:08,799
look at all the things in my priority
 

1585
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,029
look at all the things in my priority
queue at the start it's just going to be

1586
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
queue at the start it's just going to be
 

1587
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,430
queue at the start it's just going to be
s right because everything has shortest

1588
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
s right because everything has shortest
 

1589
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,470
s right because everything has shortest
path distance estimate infinite except

1590
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:16,480
path distance estimate infinite except
 

1591
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,789
path distance estimate infinite except
for s and so that's clearly the smallest

1592
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:18,799
for s and so that's clearly the smallest
 

1593
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,710
for s and so that's clearly the smallest
okay so i'm going to remove that from my

1594
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
okay so i'm going to remove that from my
 

1595
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,950
okay so i'm going to remove that from my
queue and then i'm going to process it

1596
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:22,960
queue and then i'm going to process it
 

1597
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,110
queue and then i'm going to process it
okay how am i going to process it

1598
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120
okay how am i going to process it
 

1599
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,509
okay how am i going to process it
it's the exact same kind of thing as dag

1600
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:27,519
it's the exact same kind of thing as dag
 

1601
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,990
it's the exact same kind of thing as dag
relaxation i'm going to relax all its

1602
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,000
relaxation i'm going to relax all its
 

1603
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,830
relaxation i'm going to relax all its
outgoing edges right so

1604
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:31,840
outgoing edges right so
 

1605
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,990
outgoing edges right so
just for completeness for

1606
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000

i'm going to
relax

1618
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
relax
 

1619
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,710
relax
oh sorry

1620
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720

 

1621
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,029

we have to check whether

1622
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
we have to check whether
 

1623
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,710
we have to check whether
whether we can relax it right

1624
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
whether we can relax it right
 

1625
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,110
whether we can relax it right
basically

1626
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120
basically
 

1627
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,190
basically
if

1628
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
if
 

1629
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,310
if
d the shortest path distance estimate to

00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,320
d the shortest path distance estimate to

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,630
d the shortest path distance estimate to

1632
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:08,640

 

1633
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,669

right

1634
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:09,679
right
 

1635
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,509
right
is

1636
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:11,519
is
 

1637
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,950
is
greater than

1638
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:12,960
greater than
 

1639
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,389
greater than
going to

1640
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
going to
 

1641
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,389
going to
u first and then

1642
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:16,399
u first and then
 

1643
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,310
u first and then
crossing that edge

1644
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320

 

1645
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,710

right

1646
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:22,720

 

1647
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,389

if going through that is better this

1648
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
if going through that is better this
 

1649
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,830
if going through that is better this
this is violating our triangle

1650
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:25,840
this is violating our triangle
 

1651
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,590
this is violating our triangle
inequality

1652
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
inequality
 

1653
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,669
inequality
and so we relax

1654
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:31,679

 

1655
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,830

edge

1656
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:33,840
edge
 

1657
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,029
edge
u v

1658
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:35,039
u v
 

1659
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,830
u v
and by that we mean

1660
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
and by that we mean
 

1661
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,470
and by that we mean
sets this thing to be equal to that

1662
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480
sets this thing to be equal to that
 

1663
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,230
sets this thing to be equal to that
thing

1664
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240
thing
 

1665
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,310
thing
right that's what we meant by relax and

1666
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,320
right that's what we meant by relax and
 

1667
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,190
right that's what we meant by relax and
then we have one other thing to do we've

1668
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
then we have one other thing to do we've
 

1669
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,630
then we have one other thing to do we've
changed these

1670
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:48,640
changed these
 

1671
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,430
changed these
distance estimates

1672
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440

 

1673
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,350

but our q doesn't know that we change

1674
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
but our q doesn't know that we change
 

1675
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,350
but our q doesn't know that we change
these things right we added these items

1676
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
these things right we added these items
 

1677
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,110
these things right we added these items
in here

1678
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
in here
 

1679
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,029
in here
right

1680
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:01,039
right
 

1681
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,950
right
but it doesn't know that my distances

1682
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:02,960
but it doesn't know that my distances
 

1683
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,350
but it doesn't know that my distances
has changed right so we have to tell the

1684
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,360
has changed right so we have to tell the
 

1685
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,830
has changed right so we have to tell the
queue to remember

1686
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
queue to remember
 

1687
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,389
queue to remember
we uh to change its

1688
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
we uh to change its
 

1689
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,909
we uh to change its
key value

1690
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:11,919
key value
 

1691
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,030
key value
associated with the item v

1692
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,040
associated with the item v
 

1693
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,909
associated with the item v
right

1694
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:15,919
right
 

1695
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,030
right
so

1696
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
so
 

1697
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,669
so
decrease

1698
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679

 

1699
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,589

what is it decrease

1700
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:23,599
what is it decrease
 

1701
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,270
what is it decrease

1717
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,109
v the one that i just decreased here
right and i know that i decreased it

1718
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
right and i know that i decreased it
 

1719
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,109
right and i know that i decreased it
because i set it to a smaller value that

1720
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:41,119
because i set it to a smaller value that
 

1721
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,310
because i set it to a smaller value that
makes sense

1722
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,320
makes sense
 

1723
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,669
makes sense
all right so that's

1724
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
all right so that's
 

1725
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,829
all right so that's
dijkstra

1726
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
dijkstra
 

1727
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,790
dijkstra
let's run it on

1728
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:48,800
let's run it on
 

1729
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,069
let's run it on
an example

1730
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:50,079
an example
 

1731
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,589
an example
okay so here's an example

1732
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:53,599

 

1733
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,349

i have a

1734
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359
i have a
 

1735
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,150
i have a
directed graph it does contain cycles in

1736
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160
directed graph it does contain cycles in
 

1737
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,510
directed graph it does contain cycles in
particular here are some cycles

1738
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
particular here are some cycles
 

1739
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,710
particular here are some cycles
i think those are the the main ones

1740
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
i think those are the the main ones
 

1741
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,230
i think those are the the main ones
okay there are definitely cycles in this

1742
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
okay there are definitely cycles in this
 

1743
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,589
okay there are definitely cycles in this
graph

1744
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:09,599

 

1745
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,150

and but as you see all of the weights

1746
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
and but as you see all of the weights
 

1747
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,310
and but as you see all of the weights
are non-negative in particular they're

1748
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,320
are non-negative in particular they're
 

1749
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,430
are non-negative in particular they're
positive actually it's going to be just

1750
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
positive actually it's going to be just
 

1751
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,270
positive actually it's going to be just

in writing out this example so let's run

1754
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:21,920
in writing out this example so let's run
 

1755
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,910
in writing out this example so let's run
dijkstra on this

1756
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,920
dijkstra on this
 

1757
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,550
dijkstra on this
graph okay first we initialize and we

1758
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
graph okay first we initialize and we
 

1759
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,790
graph okay first we initialize and we
set the shortest path distance i'm going

1760
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
set the shortest path distance i'm going
 

1761
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,589
set the shortest path distance i'm going
to label it in white here

1762
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
to label it in white here
 

1763
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,510
to label it in white here
to all of the things and i'm going to as

1764
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
to all of the things and i'm going to as
 

1765
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,270
to all of the things and i'm going to as
i update it i'm just going to cross them

1766
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
i update it i'm just going to cross them
 

1767
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,230
i update it i'm just going to cross them
out and write a new number okay

1768
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,240
out and write a new number okay
 

1769
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,550
out and write a new number okay
so that's what it is at the start right

1770
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
so that's what it is at the start right
 

1771
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,230
so that's what it is at the start right
that's initialization that's after step

1772
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
that's initialization that's after step
 

1773
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,030
that's initialization that's after step
one

1774
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
one
 

1775
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,270
one
and then i stick things into my queue

1776
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,280
and then i stick things into my queue
 

1777
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,790
and then i stick things into my queue
what's in my queue here's my q

1778
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
what's in my queue here's my q
 

1779
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,510
what's in my queue here's my q
right it's everything

1780
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:51,520
right it's everything
 

1781
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,829
right it's everything
right it's vertices

1782
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:53,839
right it's vertices
 

1783
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,589
right it's vertices
s a b

1784
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,599
s a b
 

1785
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,510
s a b
c d

1786
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520
c d
 

1787
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,390
c d
okay

1788
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,400
okay
 

1789
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,990
okay
i got five items

1790
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
i got five items
 

1791
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,910
i got five items
in my queue

1792
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
in my queue
 

1793
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,910
in my queue
really it's the item pair with its

1794
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
really it's the item pair with its
 

1795
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,069
really it's the item pair with its
shortest distance estimate i'm just not

1796
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
shortest distance estimate i'm just not
 

1797
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,310
shortest distance estimate i'm just not
going to rewrite that here okay

1798
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320
going to rewrite that here okay
 

1799
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,870
going to rewrite that here okay
so the idea here is what's the the while

1800
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
so the idea here is what's the the while
 

1801
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,829
so the idea here is what's the the while
loop okay q is not empty great

1802
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
loop okay q is not empty great
 

1803
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,430
loop okay q is not empty great
we're gonna delete

1804
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:15,440
we're gonna delete
 

1805
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,430
we're gonna delete
the one with the smallest distance

1806
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,440
the one with the smallest distance
 

1807
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,349
the one with the smallest distance
estimate which is

1808
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
estimate which is
 

1809
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,030
estimate which is
s right yeah

1810
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
s right yeah
 

1811
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,950
s right yeah
so i remove that

1812
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
so i remove that
 

1813
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,030
so i remove that
and then i relax edges out of s right so

1814
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,040
and then i relax edges out of s right so
 

1815
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,630
and then i relax edges out of s right so
i relax edge

1816
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
i relax edge
 

1817
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,670
i relax edge
here

1818
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
here
 

1819
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,710
here
to a

1820
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:30,720
to a
 

1821
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,870
to a
that's better than the distance estimate

1822
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:32,880
that's better than the distance estimate
 

1823
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,270
that's better than the distance estimate
10 is better than the distance estimate

1824
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
10 is better than the distance estimate
 

1825
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,589
10 is better than the distance estimate
infinite so i'm going to

1826
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
infinite so i'm going to
 

1827
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,589
infinite so i'm going to
change this to 10.

1828
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:39,599
change this to 10.
 

1829
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,910
change this to 10.
and then here's another outgoing edge

1830
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:41,920
and then here's another outgoing edge
 

1831
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,069
and then here's another outgoing edge
3 is better than

1832
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
3 is better than
 

1833
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,069
3 is better than
infinite so

1834
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
infinite so
 

1835
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,430
infinite so
i'm going to change its delta to 3.

1836
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,440
i'm going to change its delta to 3.
 

1837
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,710
i'm going to change its delta to 3.
okay so now i go back in here

1838
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:52,720
okay so now i go back in here
 

1839
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,470
okay so now i go back in here
and i change the distance estimates

1840
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
and i change the distance estimates
 

1841
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,470
and i change the distance estimates
associated with my q

1842
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:56,480
associated with my q
 

1843
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,069
associated with my q
okay

1844
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
okay
 

1845
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,150
okay
now next step of the algorithm

1846
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,160
now next step of the algorithm
 

1847
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,430
now next step of the algorithm
s is done

1848
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,440
s is done
 

1849
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,310
s is done
right i've processed everything

1850
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
right i've processed everything
 

1851
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,310
right i've processed everything
distance 0 away

1852
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,320
distance 0 away
 

1853
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,910
distance 0 away
but i'm now going to use my priority

1854
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:07,920
but i'm now going to use my priority
 

1855
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,270
but i'm now going to use my priority
queue to say

1856
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
queue to say
 

1857
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,349
queue to say
which of my vertices has the shortest

1858
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:11,359
which of my vertices has the shortest
 

1859
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,390
which of my vertices has the shortest
distance estimate now

1860
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:14,400
distance estimate now
 

1861
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,710
distance estimate now
so which one is it

1862
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:16,720
so which one is it
 

1863
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,790
so which one is it
a b or c or d

1864
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800

 

1865
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,430

yeah it's three c right three is smaller

1866
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:23,440
yeah it's three c right three is smaller
 

1867
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,030
yeah it's three c right three is smaller
than 10. so

1868
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,040
than 10. so
 

1869
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,230
than 10. so
q is going to magically delete c for me

1870
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
q is going to magically delete c for me
 

1871
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,150
q is going to magically delete c for me
tell me what that is and now i'm going

1872
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
tell me what that is and now i'm going
 

1873
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,470
tell me what that is and now i'm going
to process that right i've now changed

1874
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,480
to process that right i've now changed
 

1875
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,750
to process that right i've now changed
my boundary

1876
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:33,760
my boundary
 

1877
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,109
my boundary
to this

1878
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
to this
 

1879
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,910
to this
okay and now i relax edges

1880
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
okay and now i relax edges
 

1881
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,589
okay and now i relax edges
out of c

1882
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
out of c
 

1883
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,630
out of c
so

1884
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
so
 

1885
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,349
so
here's an edge out of c that's a 4

1886
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:43,359
here's an edge out of c that's a 4
 

1887
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,030
here's an edge out of c that's a 4
a 4 plus the 3 is smaller than 10

1888
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
a 4 plus the 3 is smaller than 10
 

1889
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,510
a 4 plus the 3 is smaller than 10
so i update it

1890
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,520
so i update it
 

1891
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,630
so i update it
3 plus 8 is 11. that's smaller than

1892
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:52,640
3 plus 8 is 11. that's smaller than
 

1893
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,470
3 plus 8 is 11. that's smaller than
infinite so i update it i relax

1894
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,480
infinite so i update it i relax
 

1895
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,430
infinite so i update it i relax
3 plus 2 is smaller than infinite so i

1896
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,440
3 plus 2 is smaller than infinite so i
 

1897
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,589
3 plus 2 is smaller than infinite so i
relax that as well

1898
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:01,599
relax that as well
 

1899
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,109
relax that as well
okay

1900
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
okay
 

1901
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,910
okay
now of the things still left in my queue

1902
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:05,920
now of the things still left in my queue
 

1903
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,670
now of the things still left in my queue
i'm actually going to

1904
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:07,680
i'm actually going to
 

1905
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,349
i'm actually going to
remove it from my queue instead of

1906
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:09,359
remove it from my queue instead of
 

1907
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,589
remove it from my queue instead of
crossing it out maybe that's better

1908
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599

 

1909
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,310

of the vertices still left in my queue

1910
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:16,320
of the vertices still left in my queue
 

1911
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,870
of the vertices still left in my queue
which has smallest distance

1912
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:18,880
which has smallest distance
 

1913
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,630
which has smallest distance
yeah d

1914
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:20,640
yeah d
 

1915
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,270
yeah d
d has five seven or eleven five is the

1916
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,280
d has five seven or eleven five is the
 

1917
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,069
d has five seven or eleven five is the
smallest so i remove d from my q and i

1918
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:26,079
smallest so i remove d from my q and i
 

1919
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,750
smallest so i remove d from my q and i
relax edges from it

1920
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:27,760
relax edges from it
 

1921
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,069
relax edges from it
and now my

1922
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,079
and now my
 

1923
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,390
and now my
boundary looks something like this

1924
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
boundary looks something like this
 

1925
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,349
boundary looks something like this
okay

1926
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
okay
 

1927
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,470
okay
i relax edges out of it five plus five

1928
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
i relax edges out of it five plus five
 

1929
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,109
i relax edges out of it five plus five
that's ten ten is smaller than eleven so

1930
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
that's ten ten is smaller than eleven so
 

1931
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,310
that's ten ten is smaller than eleven so
that's

1932
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,320
that's
 

1933
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,390
that's
a ten

1934
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
a ten
 

1935
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,750
a ten
and that's the only outgoing edge from d

1936
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:45,760
and that's the only outgoing edge from d
 

1937
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,829
and that's the only outgoing edge from d
so i'm done okay and then the last seven

1938
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:49,839
so i'm done okay and then the last seven
 

1939
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,589
so i'm done okay and then the last seven
is smaller than 10.

1940
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599

 

1941
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,470

i relax edges out of a

1942
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,480
i relax edges out of a
 

1943
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,990
i relax edges out of a
right

1944
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
right
 

1945
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,030
right
a

1946
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,040
a
 

1947
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,870
a
to b

1948
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:00,880
to b
 

1949
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:09,430
to b
seven plus two is smaller than ten

1950
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,440

 

1951
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,109

and now i'm done so what i did every

1952
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,119
and now i'm done so what i did every
 

1953
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,150
and now i'm done so what i did every
time i

1954
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,160
time i
 

1955
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,990
time i
removed s or i removed a vertex i set

1956
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,000
removed s or i removed a vertex i set
 

1957
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,190
removed s or i removed a vertex i set
its shortest path distance to the

1958
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
its shortest path distance to the
 

1959
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,910
its shortest path distance to the
small the the last value i assigned to

1960
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920
small the the last value i assigned to
 

1961
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,430
small the the last value i assigned to
it so this was then three

1962
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
it so this was then three
 

1963
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,750
it so this was then three
and then a was seven

1964
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
and then a was seven
 

1965
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,589
and then a was seven
b was nine

1966
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:29,599
b was nine
 

1967
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,910
b was nine
and then d was five

1968
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:31,920
and then d was five
 

1969
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,950
and then d was five
okay

1970
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:32,960
okay
 

1971
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,349
okay
so that's dijkstra in action

1972
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
so that's dijkstra in action
 

1973
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,030
so that's dijkstra in action
it seems like

1974
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,040
it seems like
 

1975
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,109
it seems like
these are the shortest path distances

1976
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
these are the shortest path distances
 

1977
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,270
these are the shortest path distances
but how do we prove that did it do the

1978
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,280
but how do we prove that did it do the
 

1979
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,829
but how do we prove that did it do the
right thing

1980
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
right thing
 

1981
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,349
right thing
well let's find out

1982
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
well let's find out
 

1983
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,349
well let's find out
so that's what we're going to spend

1984
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359
so that's what we're going to spend
 

1985
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,670
so that's what we're going to spend
some time on right now is talking about

1986
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:49,680
some time on right now is talking about
 

1987
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:57,589
some time on right now is talking about
the correctness of dijkstra's algorithm

1988
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599

 

1989
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,390

okay correctness follows from

1990
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400

 

1991
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,510

kind of

1992
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,520
kind of
 

1993
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,510
kind of
two main observations

1994
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:05,520
two main observations
 

1995
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,309
two main observations
okay so the the claim here that we're

1996
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:08,319
okay so the the claim here that we're
 

1997
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,829
okay so the the claim here that we're
trying to prove is that

1998
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:11,839
trying to prove is that
 

1999
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,230
trying to prove is that
d of s

2000
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240
d of s
 

2001
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,069
d of s
equals the delta

2002
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,079

 

2003
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,309

s so the estimates

2004
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:20,319
s so the estimates
 

2005
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,750
s so the estimates
equal the shortest path distances

2006
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
equal the shortest path distances
 

2007
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,630
equal the shortest path distances
at the end of dijkstra

2008
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:26,640
at the end of dijkstra
 

2009
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,309
at the end of dijkstra
for all

2010
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:30,319

 

2011
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,550

all right

2018

all right
 

2019
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,109
all right
and this is going to follow from two

2020

and this is going to follow from two
 

2021
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,150

i argue to you

i argue to you
 

2039
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,349
i argue to you
that

00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
that
 

2041
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,910

2049
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,230

okay that's not a very strong statement

2050
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
okay that's not a very strong statement
 

2051
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,270
okay that's not a very strong statement
right this is saying if i ever set the

2052
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
right this is saying if i ever set the
 

2053
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,030
right this is saying if i ever set the
the distance estimate

2054

the distance estimate
 

2055

i'm never going to set it to a different

value later on
 

2061
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,069
value later on
and why is that

2062
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079

 

2063
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,109

well

2064
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
well
 

2065
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,390
well
relaxation

2066
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,400
relaxation
 

2067
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,510
relaxation
only ever decreases the distance right

2068
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520

 

2069
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,470

relaxation
 

2071
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,990
relaxation
only decreases

2072
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000

but

2076
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
but
 

2077
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,430
but
we proved in lecture 11 so two lectures

2078
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
we proved in lecture 11 so two lectures
 

2079
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,990
we proved in lecture 11 so two lectures
ago that relaxation is safe

2080
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,000

 

2081
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,910

and what is safe mean

2082
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
and what is safe mean
 

2083
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,750
and what is safe mean
safe means that

2084
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:05,760
safe means that
 

2085
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,630
safe means that
relaxation

2086
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:08,640

 

2087
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,790

that these relaxation will only ever

2088
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:10,800
that these relaxation will only ever
 

2089
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,510
that these relaxation will only ever
change these distance estimates

2090
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
change these distance estimates
 

2091
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,829
change these distance estimates
to

00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:14,839

2093
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,270

infinite right it was never there was

infinite right it was never there was
 

2097
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,270
infinite right it was never there was
never a path

2098
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
never a path
 

2099
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,630
never a path
to my

2100
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:22,640
to my
 

2101
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,190
to my
my vertex or

2102
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,200
my vertex or
 

2103
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,510
my vertex or
it was the length of some path to v

2104
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520

 

2105
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,670

length

2106
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:33,680
length
 

2107
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,550
length
of

2108
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:34,560
of
 

2109
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,150
of
some

2110
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
some
 

2111
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,630
some
path

2112
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:38,640

 

2113
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,990

okay so what does that mean

2114
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,000
okay so what does that mean
 

2115
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,109
okay so what does that mean
it only decreases

2116
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
it only decreases
 

2117
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,030
it only decreases
but it's always the length of some path

2118
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,040
but it's always the length of some path
 

2119
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,750
but it's always the length of some path
to v right so if this is the length of

2120
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:49,760
to v right so if this is the length of
 

2121
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,150
to v right so if this is the length of
the shortest path to v i could never set

2122
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,160
the shortest path to v i could never set
 

2123
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,829
the shortest path to v i could never set
it to a smaller length

2124
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:53,839
it to a smaller length
 

2125
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,150
it to a smaller length
right because there are no paths with

2126
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,160
right because there are no paths with
 

2127
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,349
right because there are no paths with
shorter distance that's the kind of

2128
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:57,359
shorter distance that's the kind of
 

2129
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,750
shorter distance that's the kind of
little point okay so with this

2130
00:42:59,750 --> 00:42:59,760
little point okay so with this
 

2131
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,829
little point okay so with this
observation

2132
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:01,839
observation
 

2133
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,510

i i'm gonna argue this final claim

2134
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520
i i'm gonna argue this final claim
 

2135
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,069
i i'm gonna argue this final claim
it suffices to show

2136
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:12,079

 

2137
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,390

that

2138
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400

 

2139
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,990

my estimate

2140
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,000
my estimate
 

2141
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,790
my estimate
equals the shortest distance

2142
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:22,800

 

2143
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,349

when

2144
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,910

okay
 

2153
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,710

and since i remove every vertex from the

in this while loop
i will have eventually set all of the

happy days all right so we'll be done

2166
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
happy days all right so we'll be done
 

2167
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,109
happy days all right so we'll be done
if we can prove that statement all right

2168
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
if we can prove that statement all right
 

2169
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,750
if we can prove that statement all right
so we're gonna prove this by induction

2170
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,760
so we're gonna prove this by induction
 

2171
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,109
so we're gonna prove this by induction
obviously

2172
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,470

the queue
 

2189
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,430
the queue
all right so the q

2190
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
all right so the q
 

2191
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,150
all right so the q
we're we're popping vertices from this q

2192
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,160
we're we're popping vertices from this q
 

2193
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,990
we're we're popping vertices from this q
in some order

2194
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,000
in some order
 

2195
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,309
in some order
so i'm going to just argue that this

2196
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:30,319
so i'm going to just argue that this
 

2197
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,670
so i'm going to just argue that this
claim is true for the first k

2198
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:33,680
claim is true for the first k
 

2199
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,710
claim is true for the first k
right

2200
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
right
 

2201
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,230
right
clearly that's true for k equals 1

2202
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,240
clearly that's true for k equals 1
 

2203
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,510
clearly that's true for k equals 1
base case

2204
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520

 

2205
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,309

k equals 1

2206
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:44,319
k equals 1
 

2207
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,069
k equals 1
right what is k equals 1 that means the

2208
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079
right what is k equals 1 that means the
 

2209
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,829
right what is k equals 1 that means the
first vertex that i pop has this

2210
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:48,839
first vertex that i pop has this
 

2211
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,870
first vertex that i pop has this
property which is definitely true

2212
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880
property which is definitely true
 

2213
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,230
property which is definitely true
because we set

2214
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240
because we set
 

2215
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,990
because we set
the shortest path distance to s to be

2216
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
the shortest path distance to s to be
 

2217
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,230
the shortest path distance to s to be
zero that's all good

2218
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,240
zero that's all good
 

2219
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,990
zero that's all good
okay

2220
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:58,000
okay
 

2221
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:08,069
okay
now we have our inductive step

2222
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:08,079

 

2223
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,190

okay

2224
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,200
okay
 

2225
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,870
okay
assume it's true

2226
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:12,880

 

2227
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,390

and let's let

2238
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720

okay v prime
 

2249
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,470
okay v prime
okay

2250
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
okay
 

2251
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,790
okay
and now let's look at some

2252
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:38,800
and now let's look at some
 

2253
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,950
and now let's look at some
shortest path

2254
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
shortest path
 

2255
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,710
shortest path
from s

2256
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720

 

2257
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,710

to v prime

2258
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:48,720
to v prime
 

2259
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,870
to v prime
so we got the shortest path

2260
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
so we got the shortest path
 

2261
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,109
so we got the shortest path
from s to v prime

2262
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,119
from s to v prime
 

2263
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,589
from s to v prime
it exists v prime is

2264
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:55,599
it exists v prime is
 

2265
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,230
it exists v prime is
accessible let's say we pruned our graph

2266
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:58,240
accessible let's say we pruned our graph
 

2267
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,950
accessible let's say we pruned our graph
to be only the things accessible from s

2268
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
to be only the things accessible from s
 

2269
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,910
to be only the things accessible from s
so that

2270
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:01,920
so that
 

2271
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,309
so that
yeah there exists a shortest path

2272
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319
yeah there exists a shortest path
 

2273
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,510
yeah there exists a shortest path
to v prime okay

2274
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:07,520
to v prime okay
 

2275
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,829
to v prime okay
and now let's think about

2276
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:09,839
and now let's think about
 

2277
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,829
and now let's think about
these vertices

2278
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:11,839
these vertices
 

2279
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,589
these vertices
some of them

2280
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:13,599
some of them
 

2281
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,510
some of them
were removed from the queue

2282
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:15,520
were removed from the queue
 

2283
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,910
were removed from the queue
and some of them were not right s was

2284
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:17,920
and some of them were not right s was
 

2285
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,990
and some of them were not right s was
definitely removed from the queue

2286
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:20,000
definitely removed from the queue
 

2287
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,190
definitely removed from the queue
right

2288
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,200
right
 

2289
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,990
right
but

2290
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,000
but
 

2291
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,670
but
some of these other vertices might not

2292
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
some of these other vertices might not
 

2293
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,630
some of these other vertices might not
be

2294
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:24,640
be
 

2295
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,790
be
right i want to be able to induct on

2296
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:26,800
right i want to be able to induct on
 

2297
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,390
right i want to be able to induct on
this path in particular

2298
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
this path in particular
 

2299
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,230
this path in particular
the vertex before me

2300
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
the vertex before me
 

2301
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,630
the vertex before me
so that i can say that when i removed it

2302
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:32,640
so that i can say that when i removed it
 

2303
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,750
so that i can say that when i removed it
and i relax the edge to v prime

2304
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
and i relax the edge to v prime
 

2305
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,109
and i relax the edge to v prime
then we're all golden right

2306
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:39,119
then we're all golden right
 

2307
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,790
then we're all golden right
but that might not be the case there

2308
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
but that might not be the case there
 

2309
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,510
but that might not be the case there
could be a vertex the vertex preceding

2310
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:43,520
could be a vertex the vertex preceding
 

2311
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,190
could be a vertex the vertex preceding

which means that by induction

okay

2396
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,480
okay
 

2397
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,950
okay
but this is on the shortest path to y

2398
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
but this is on the shortest path to y
 

2399
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,109
but this is on the shortest path to y
right because sub paths of

00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:25,119
right because sub paths of
 

2401
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,270
right because sub paths of
shortest paths are shortest paths so

2402
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,280
shortest paths are shortest paths so
 

2403
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,270
shortest paths are shortest paths so
this has to equal

2404
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
this has to equal
 

2405
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,309
this has to equal

s y right the distance to y so actually
 

2409
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,910
s y right the distance to y so actually
y is all good here right and so if v

2410
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:35,920
y is all good here right and so if v
 

2411
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,630
y is all good here right and so if v

2412
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
prime were y we'd be done
 

2413
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,710
prime were y we'd be done
right that's the same argument as dag

2414
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:40,720
right that's the same argument as dag
 

2415
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,710
right that's the same argument as dag

2417
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,230

2421
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,190

well because we have non-negative

2422
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:49,200
well because we have non-negative

2427
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,549

distance right because it's a sub-path
 

2429
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,150
distance right because it's a sub-path
right so this has to be less than or

2430
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,160
right so this has to be less than or
 

2431
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,430
right so this has to be less than or
equal to the true distance

00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:14,960

 

2445
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,069

but because relaxation is safe

2446
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:18,079
but because relaxation is safe
 

2447
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,309
but because relaxation is safe
we know that our distance estimate for v

2448
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
we know that our distance estimate for v
 

2449
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,549
we know that our distance estimate for v
prime has to be at least the shortest

2450
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:22,559
prime has to be at least the shortest
 

2451
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,829
prime has to be at least the shortest
path distance right

2452
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839

 

2453
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,349

right this is because it's safe

2454
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
right this is because it's safe
 

2455
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,630
right this is because it's safe
this is

2456
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:32,640
this is
 

2457
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,470
this is
weights are

2458
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:34,480
weights are
 

2459
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,349
weights are
uh

2460
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:35,359
uh
 

2461
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,589
uh
greater than or equal to zero

greater than or equal to zero
 

2463
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,910
greater than or equal to zero
right

2464
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:39,920

 

2465
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,670

the last step here

2466
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
the last step here
 

2467
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,870
the last step here
is that

2468
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:42,880
is that
 

2469
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,270
is that
because we're popping the minimum from

2470
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:45,280
because we're popping the minimum from
 

2471
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,430
because we're popping the minimum from
our priority queue

2472
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:47,440
our priority queue
 

2473
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,510
our priority queue
right the thing with the smallest

2474
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
right the thing with the smallest
 

2475
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,349
right the thing with the smallest
shortest path distance

2476
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:51,359
shortest path distance
 

2477
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,190
shortest path distance
this has to be less than or equal to

2478
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,200
this has to be less than or equal to
 

2479
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,030
this has to be less than or equal to
the shortest path distance estimate to y

2480
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
the shortest path distance estimate to y
 

2481
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,950
the shortest path distance estimate to y
right because this is the smallest among

2482
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:00,960
right because this is the smallest among
 

2483
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,510
right because this is the smallest among
all such vertices in my queue

2484
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:05,520

 

2485
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,349

but these are the same value

2486
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:07,359
but these are the same value
 

2487
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,589
but these are the same value
so everything between here is the same

2488
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:09,599
so everything between here is the same
 

2489
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,309
so everything between here is the same
value in particular

2490
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
value in particular
 

2491
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,990
value in particular
the estimate here

2492
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:14,000
the estimate here
 

2493
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,990
the estimate here
is equal to my true shortest path

2494
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,000
is equal to my true shortest path
 

2495
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,670
is equal to my true shortest path
distance which is exactly what we're

2496
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:17,680
distance which is exactly what we're
 

2497
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,190
distance which is exactly what we're
trying to prove okay so that's why

2498
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
trying to prove okay so that's why
 

2499
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,270
trying to prove okay so that's why
dijkstra is correct

2500
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:21,280
dijkstra is correct
 

2501
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,309
dijkstra is correct
and spend the last five minutes on

2502
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
and spend the last five minutes on
 

2503
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,470
and spend the last five minutes on
the running time of dykstra

2504
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,480

 

2505
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,910

well we set this up

2506
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920

 

2507
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,549

so that we did everything in terms of

2508
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
so that we did everything in terms of
 

2509
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,430
so that we did everything in terms of
this

2510
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
this
 

2511
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,270
this
these q operations

2512
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
these q operations
 

2513
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,069
these q operations
right so we have these q operations we

2514
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:42,079
right so we have these q operations we
 

2515
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,349
right so we have these q operations we
have three of them

2516
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:43,359
have three of them
 

2517
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:47,510
have three of them
i'm going to say if i have

2518
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520

 

2519
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,430

a build operation let's say it takes b

2520
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
a build operation let's say it takes b
 

2521
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,309
a build operation let's say it takes b
time

2522
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:50,319
time
 

2523
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,230
time
delete min i'm going to say it takes m

2524
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
delete min i'm going to say it takes m
 

2525
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,470
delete min i'm going to say it takes m
time and this decreased key i'm going to

2526
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
time and this decreased key i'm going to
 

2527
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,309
time and this decreased key i'm going to
say it takes d time

2528
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:56,319
say it takes d time
 

2529
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,230
say it takes d time
okay so what's the running time of

2530
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
okay so what's the running time of
 

2531
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,710
okay so what's the running time of
dijkstra if i take a look at that

2532
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:00,720
dijkstra if i take a look at that
 

2533
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,109
dijkstra if i take a look at that
algorithm over there

2534
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:03,119
algorithm over there
 

2535
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,069
algorithm over there
well i guess

2536
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:06,079

 

2537
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,829

let's switch these back up again

2538
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
let's switch these back up again
 

2539
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,069
let's switch these back up again
okay so what does this do we build once

2540
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:14,079
okay so what does this do we build once
 

2541
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,270
okay so what does this do we build once
right

2542
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
right
 

2543
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,030
right
then we delete

2544
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,040
then we delete
 

2545
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,190
then we delete
the minimum from the queue how many

2546
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
the minimum from the queue how many
 

2547
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,030
the minimum from the queue how many
times

2548
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,040
times
 

2549
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,910
times
v times right we remove every vertex

2550
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:23,920
v times right we remove every vertex
 

2551
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,470
v times right we remove every vertex
from our q

2552
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:26,480
from our q
 

2553
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,270
from our q
then

2554
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
then
 

2555
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,069
then
for every possible edge

2556
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
for every possible edge
 

2557
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,470
for every possible edge
we may need to relax

2558
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,480
we may need to relax
 

2559
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,349
we may need to relax
and decrease the key in our queue

2560
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:35,359
and decrease the key in our queue
 

2561
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,150
and decrease the key in our queue
once for every outgoing edge

2562
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,160
once for every outgoing edge
 

2563
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,230
once for every outgoing edge
okay

2564
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,240
okay
 

2565
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,790
okay
so the running time is

2566
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
so the running time is
 

2567
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,790
so the running time is
b plus

2568
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,800
b plus
 

2569
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,069
b plus
v times

2570
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:46,079
v times

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,270
v times

2572
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
m
 

2573
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,230
m
plus

2574
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,240

2575
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,270
plus
e

2576
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:49,280

d

2580
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,000
d
 

2581
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,630
d
right

2582
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640

 

2583
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,510

okay

2584
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
okay
 

2585
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,510
okay
so how could we implement this priority

2586
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:57,520
so how could we implement this priority
 

2587
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,829
so how could we implement this priority
queue well

2588
00:51:59,829 --> 00:51:59,839
queue well
 

2589
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,069
queue well
if we use the stupidest priority in the

2590
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
if we use the stupidest priority in the
 

2591
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,750
if we use the stupidest priority in the
world

2592
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:03,760
world
 

2593
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,190
world
here's here's a list of different

2594
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,200
here's here's a list of different
 

2595
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,630
here's here's a list of different
implementations we could have for our

2596
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640
implementations we could have for our
 

2597
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,390
implementations we could have for our
priority queues

2598
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:08,400
priority queues
 

2599
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,870
priority queues
and when i say priority queue i mean

2600
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:10,880
and when i say priority queue i mean
 

2601
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,710
and when i say priority queue i mean
this priority queue

2602
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
this priority queue
 

2603
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,069
this priority queue
we're already implementing the

2604
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:14,079
we're already implementing the
 

2605
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,750
we're already implementing the
changeable priority queue by linking it

2606
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:15,760
changeable priority queue by linking it
 

2607
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,630
changeable priority queue by linking it
with a dictionary that's efficient okay

2608
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:18,640
with a dictionary that's efficient okay
 

2609
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,470
with a dictionary that's efficient okay
if i just use an array

2610
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:20,480
if i just use an array
 

2611
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,829
if i just use an array
i can find the min in linear time sure

2612
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:23,839
i can find the min in linear time sure
 

2613
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,069
i can find the min in linear time sure
and i don't have to update that array in

2614
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:26,079
and i don't have to update that array in
 

2615
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,270
and i don't have to update that array in
any way

2616
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:29,280

 

2617
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,109

i mean i can just keep the distances in

2618
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
i mean i can just keep the distances in
 

2619
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,950
i mean i can just keep the distances in
my direct access array i don't have to

2620
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:34,960
my direct access array i don't have to
 

2621
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,710
my direct access array i don't have to
store a separate data structure i just

2622
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
store a separate data structure i just
 

2623
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,630
store a separate data structure i just
store the distances in my direct access

2624
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:38,640
store the distances in my direct access
 

2625
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,230
store the distances in my direct access
array d

2626
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,240
array d
 

2627
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,109
array d
and so i can find it in constant time

2628
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
and so i can find it in constant time
 

2629
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,109
and so i can find it in constant time
and i can update the values stored there

2630
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:45,119
and i can update the values stored there
 

2631
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,710
and i can update the values stored there
and then whenever i want the minimum i

2632
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:46,720
and then whenever i want the minimum i
 

2633
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,710
and then whenever i want the minimum i
can just loop through the whole thing

2634
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:48,720
can just loop through the whole thing
 

2635
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,390
can just loop through the whole thing
right so that gives me a really fast

2636
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,400
right so that gives me a really fast
 

2637
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,829
right so that gives me a really fast
decreased key

2638
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
decreased key
 

2639
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,710
decreased key
but slow delete min but if we take a

2640
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:54,720
but slow delete min but if we take a
 

2641
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,790
but slow delete min but if we take a
look at the running time bound here

2642
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:58,800

 

2643
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,430

we get something if we replace n with v

2644
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
we get something if we replace n with v
 

2645
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,190
we get something if we replace n with v
we get a quadratic time algorithm

2646
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,200
we get a quadratic time algorithm
 

2647
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,270
we get a quadratic time algorithm
in the number of vertices which

2648
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,280
in the number of vertices which
 

2649
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,470
in the number of vertices which
for

2650
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
for
 

2651
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,349
for
a

2652
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:09,359
a
 

2653
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,750
a
dense graph this is in linear time

2654
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:11,760
dense graph this is in linear time
 

2655
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,030
dense graph this is in linear time
that's actually pretty good dense

2656
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:13,040
that's actually pretty good dense
 

2657
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,950
that's actually pretty good dense
meaning that i have at least a quadratic

2658
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
meaning that i have at least a quadratic
 

2659
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,150
meaning that i have at least a quadratic
number of vertices

2660
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160

 

2661
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,990

so that's actually really good and it's

2662
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
so that's actually really good and it's
 

2663
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,309
so that's actually really good and it's
the stupidest possible

2664
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
the stupidest possible
 

2665
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,069
the stupidest possible
data structure we could use for this

2666
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:24,079
data structure we could use for this
 

2667
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,270

now we can do a little better

2670
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:27,119
now we can do a little better
 

2671
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,109
now we can do a little better
actually for not dense i mean for sparse

2672
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:31,119
actually for not dense i mean for sparse
 

2673
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,430
actually for not dense i mean for sparse

then

2678
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
then
 

2679
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,990
then
this is pretty bad it's quadratic right

2680
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,000
this is pretty bad it's quadratic right
 

2681
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,670
this is pretty bad it's quadratic right

okay and if i do that and i put it into

2710
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,280
okay and if i do that and i put it into
 

2711
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,790
okay and if i do that and i put it into
this formula

2712
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:14,800
this formula

i actually get n

2714
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:16,720
i actually get n
 

2715
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,030
i actually get n
or v

2716
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,040
or v
 

2717
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,829
or v
plus v times log v

plus e times log v
 

2721
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,950
plus e times log v
right and so that's going to give me

2722
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:26,960
right and so that's going to give me
 

2723
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,470
right and so that's going to give me
e log v if i'm assuming that i'm first

00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,190
running time bound
for your problem

2784
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:45,200
for your problem
 

2785
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,549
for your problem
a plus

2786
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:46,559
a plus
 

2787
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,069
a plus
v log v but if you happen to know that

2788
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:50,079
v log v but if you happen to know that
 

2789
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,069
v log v but if you happen to know that
your graph is sparse or dense

2790
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079

 

2791
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,630

just using an array or a heap is going

2792
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
just using an array or a heap is going
 

2793
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,789
just using an array or a heap is going
to get you just as good of a running

2794
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
to get you just as good of a running
 

2795
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,349
to get you just as good of a running
time very close to linear

2796
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:01,359
time very close to linear
 

2797
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,710
time very close to linear
right and so in practice

2798
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:04,720
right and so in practice
 

2799
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,470
right and so in practice
most people when they're implementing a

2800
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:06,480
most people when they're implementing a
 

2801
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,630
most people when they're implementing a
graph search algorithm they know

2802
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:08,640
graph search algorithm they know
 

2803
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,870
graph search algorithm they know
if their graph is sparse or dense and so

2804
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:10,880
if their graph is sparse or dense and so
 

2805
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,470
if their graph is sparse or dense and so
they never bother implementing a

2806
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
they never bother implementing a
 

2807
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,990
they never bother implementing a
fibonacci heap which is a little

2808
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,000
fibonacci heap which is a little
 

2809
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,190
fibonacci heap which is a little
complicated okay so they are usually

2810
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
complicated okay so they are usually
 

2811
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,430
complicated okay so they are usually
either in one of these first two cases

2812
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:19,440
either in one of these first two cases
 

2813
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,589
either in one of these first two cases
where v squared is linear because when

2814
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
where v squared is linear because when
 

2815
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,270
where v squared is linear because when
your graph is dense

2816
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
your graph is dense
 

2817
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,069
your graph is dense
or

2818
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:24,079
or
 

2819
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,990
or
you know we're very close to linear e

2820
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
you know we're very close to linear e
 

2821
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,510
you know we're very close to linear e
times log v

2822
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,520
times log v
 

2823
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,789
times log v
which is v log v if your graph is sparse

2824
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
which is v log v if your graph is sparse
 

2825
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,630
which is v log v if your graph is sparse
okay so that's

2826
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:32,640
okay so that's
 

2827
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,750
okay so that's
uh

2828
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:33,760
uh
 

2829
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,710
uh
the running time of dykstra

2830
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:36,720
the running time of dykstra
 

2831
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,990
the running time of dykstra
okay

2832
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,000
okay
 

2833
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,309
okay
so

2834
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:40,319

 

2835
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:41,589

so far

2836
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:41,599
so far
 

2837
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,309
so far
we've gotten all of these nice bounds

2838
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:44,319
we've gotten all of these nice bounds
 

2839
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,750
we've gotten all of these nice bounds
right

2840
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
right
 

2841
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,910
right

and bellman ford you know if we throw

2848
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
and bellman ford you know if we throw
 

2849
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,950

we got to spend that quadratic running
 

2857
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,309
we got to spend that quadratic running
time bound now there are faster

2858
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:04,319
time bound now there are faster
 

2859
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,309
time bound now there are faster
algorithms but this is the fastest we're

2860
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:06,319
algorithms but this is the fastest we're
 

2861

talking about all pairs shortest paths
and we'll pick it up

2868
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,480
and we'll pick it up
 

2869
