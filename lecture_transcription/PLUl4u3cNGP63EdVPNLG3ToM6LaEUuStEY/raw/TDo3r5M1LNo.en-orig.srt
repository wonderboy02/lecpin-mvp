00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,830
lectures we are
over halfway through uh into lecture

three of four

10
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
three of four
 

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,269
three of four
uh today we're going to follow up on

12
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
uh today we're going to follow up on
 

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,070
uh today we're going to follow up on
this idea

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
this idea
 

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,550
this idea
of problem constraints and expansion

16
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
of problem constraints and expansion
 

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,349
of problem constraints and expansion
that was

18
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
that was
 

19
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,269
that was
mentioned especially towards the end of

20
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
mentioned especially towards the end of
 

21
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,549
mentioned especially towards the end of
last lecture we saw

22
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
last lecture we saw
 

23
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,750
last lecture we saw
an example of sub-problem expansion by a

24
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
an example of sub-problem expansion by a
 

25
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,870
an example of sub-problem expansion by a
factor of two

26
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
factor of two
 

27
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,510
factor of two
in the two-player game with coins where

28
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
in the two-player game with coins where
 

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,830
in the two-player game with coins where
we wanted to

30
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
we wanted to
 

31
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,510
we wanted to
have two versions of the game one where

32
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
have two versions of the game one where
 

33
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,510
have two versions of the game one where
i go first and one where you go first so

34
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
i go first and one where you go first so
 

35
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,069
i go first and one where you go first so
this was

36
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
this was
 

37
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,590
this was
expanding the number of sub problems by

38
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
expanding the number of sub problems by
 

39
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,430
expanding the number of sub problems by
factor of two today we'll see a bunch

40
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
factor of two today we'll see a bunch
 

41
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,110
factor of two today we'll see a bunch
more examples of this idea

42
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
more examples of this idea
 

43
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,029
more examples of this idea
including in one setting we've seen

44
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
including in one setting we've seen
 

45
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,790
including in one setting we've seen
already which is bellman ford which you

46
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
already which is bellman ford which you
 

47
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,510
already which is bellman ford which you
can think of

48
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
can think of
 

49
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,990
can think of
as a dynamic program maybe it's a good

50
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
as a dynamic program maybe it's a good
 

51
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,510
as a dynamic program maybe it's a good
time to mention that bellman

52
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
time to mention that bellman
 

53
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,869
time to mention that bellman
invented dynamic programming in the 50s

54
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
invented dynamic programming in the 50s
 

55
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,789
invented dynamic programming in the 50s
same bellman in the bellman ford

56
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
same bellman in the bellman ford
 

57
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,230
same bellman in the bellman ford
algorithm this was actually independent

58
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
algorithm this was actually independent
 

59
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,670
algorithm this was actually independent
discovery by both of them

60
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
discovery by both of them
 

61
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,870
discovery by both of them
and other people so

62
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
and other people so
 

63
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,870
and other people so
he invented dynamic programming and then

64
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
he invented dynamic programming and then
 

65
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,630
he invented dynamic programming and then
a few years later he applied it to solve

66
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
a few years later he applied it to solve
 

67
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,310
a few years later he applied it to solve
the single source shortest paths problem

68
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
the single source shortest paths problem
 

69
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,990
the single source shortest paths problem
so we saw them in the other order we saw

70
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
so we saw them in the other order we saw
 

71
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,270
so we saw them in the other order we saw
single source shortest paths first

72
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
single source shortest paths first
 

73
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,710
single source shortest paths first
because it's a little easier

74
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
because it's a little easier
 

75
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,910
because it's a little easier
and now we're seeing the general

76
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
and now we're seeing the general
 

77
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,230
and now we're seeing the general
framework that this fits into

78
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
framework that this fits into
 

79
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,550
framework that this fits into
and so we'll see how how that works uh

80
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
and so we'll see how how that works uh
 

81
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,550
and so we'll see how how that works uh
why did bellman call dynamic programming

82
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
why did bellman call dynamic programming
 

83
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,149
why did bellman call dynamic programming
dynamic programming mostly because it

84
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
dynamic programming mostly because it
 

85
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,270
dynamic programming mostly because it
sounded cool

86
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
sounded cool
 

87
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,429
sounded cool
and he was trying to impress uh

88
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
and he was trying to impress uh
 

89
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,510
and he was trying to impress uh
government agencies giving him grants

90
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
government agencies giving him grants
 

91
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,789
government agencies giving him grants
i mean how can you argue with something

92
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
i mean how can you argue with something
 

93
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,270
i mean how can you argue with something
as cool sounding as dynamic programming

94
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
as cool sounding as dynamic programming
 

95
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,950
as cool sounding as dynamic programming
but there is some logic to it

96
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
but there is some logic to it
 

97
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,870
but there is some logic to it
programming is a reference to an old

98
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
programming is a reference to an old
 

99
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,069
programming is a reference to an old
form of this word which means

100
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
form of this word which means
 

101
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,670
form of this word which means
optimization and generally we're trying

102
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
optimization and generally we're trying
 

103
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,950
optimization and generally we're trying
to optimize things

104
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
to optimize things
 

105
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,030
to optimize things
and instead of optimizing according to

106
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
and instead of optimizing according to
 

107
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,870
and instead of optimizing according to
some static kind of

108
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
some static kind of
 

109
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,350
some static kind of
approach or program we're doing it

110
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
approach or program we're doing it
 

111
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,469
approach or program we're doing it
dynamically this is

112
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
dynamically this is
 

113
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,149
dynamically this is
a reference to the local brute force

114
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
a reference to the local brute force
 

115
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,469
a reference to the local brute force
we're doing to optimize at each stage

116
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
we're doing to optimize at each stage
 

117
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,709
we're doing to optimize at each stage
so you can't tell at the top whether

118
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
so you can't tell at the top whether
 

119
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,550
so you can't tell at the top whether
what you're going to do in the middle

120
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
what you're going to do in the middle
 

121
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,389
what you're going to do in the middle
and so it's kind of each each

122
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
and so it's kind of each each
 

123
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,590
and so it's kind of each each
sub-problem is is

124
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
sub-problem is is
 

125
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,789
sub-problem is is
behaving differently and so in that

126
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
behaving differently and so in that
 

127
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,109
behaving differently and so in that
sense dynamic

128
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
sense dynamic
 

129
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,270
sense dynamic
it sounds cool all right then we'll go

130
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
it sounds cool all right then we'll go
 

131
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,710
it sounds cool all right then we'll go
to all pair shortest paths we'll see a

132
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
to all pair shortest paths we'll see a
 

133
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,869
to all pair shortest paths we'll see a
new algorithm for that

134
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
new algorithm for that
 

135
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,430
new algorithm for that
that's not asymptotically any better but

136
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
that's not asymptotically any better but
 

137
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,270
that's not asymptotically any better but
it's nice and simple and another way to

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,110
it's nice and simple and another way to

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
a cool way to see uh subproblem
 

141
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,270
a cool way to see uh subproblem
expansion and then we'll look at a

142
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
expansion and then we'll look at a
 

143
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,550
expansion and then we'll look at a

what that is

160
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
what that is
 

161
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,710
what that is
we define subproblems and we saw how to

162
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
we define subproblems and we saw how to
 

163
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,630
we define subproblems and we saw how to
do that for sequences we try either

164
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
do that for sequences we try either

prefixes suffixes or substrings
 

167
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,710
prefixes suffixes or substrings
we prefer prefixes and suffix because

168
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
we prefer prefixes and suffix because
 

169
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,309
we prefer prefixes and suffix because
there's fewer of them

170
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
there's fewer of them

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,630
there's fewer of them
if there's more than one sequence we

172
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
if there's more than one sequence we
 

173
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,710
if there's more than one sequence we
take the product of those spaces

174
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
take the product of those spaces
 

175
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,229
take the product of those spaces
um and then the idea we're going to

176
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
um and then the idea we're going to
 

177
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,390
um and then the idea we're going to
stress today is we can always add

178
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
stress today is we can always add
 

179
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,229
stress today is we can always add
sub-problems to make the next step

180
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
sub-problems to make the next step
 

181
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,270
sub-problems to make the next step
easier

182
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
easier
 

183
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,869
easier
in particular adding constraints to

184
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
in particular adding constraints to
 

185
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,869
in particular adding constraints to
sub-problems in some sense lets us

186
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
sub-problems in some sense lets us
 

187
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,990
sub-problems in some sense lets us
remember things about the subproblem

188
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
remember things about the subproblem
 

189
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,030
remember things about the subproblem
that's calling us

190
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
that's calling us
 

191
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,030
that's calling us
or about the past is one way to think

192
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
or about the past is one way to think
 

193
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,190
or about the past is one way to think
about it or in general to remember state

194
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
about it or in general to remember state
 

195
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,790
about it or in general to remember state
just by adding more sub problems we can

196
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
just by adding more sub problems we can
 

197
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,710
just by adding more sub problems we can
remember more stuff

198
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
remember more stuff
 

199
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,710
remember more stuff
not just what things we're working on

200
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
not just what things we're working on
 

201
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,869
not just what things we're working on
but some context

202
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
but some context
 

203
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,910
but some context
and that's what we'll see lots of

204
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
and that's what we'll see lots of
 

205
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,750
and that's what we'll see lots of
examples of today it'll hopefully make

206
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
examples of today it'll hopefully make
 

207
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,670
examples of today it'll hopefully make
sense by the end of the lecture

208
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
sense by the end of the lecture
 

209
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,350
sense by the end of the lecture
then we need to relate these sub

210
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
then we need to relate these sub
 

211
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,190
then we need to relate these sub
problems with a recurrence relation

212
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
problems with a recurrence relation
 

213
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,190
problems with a recurrence relation
which we usually just call a relation

214
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
which we usually just call a relation
 

215
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,949
which we usually just call a relation
and the key idea here

216
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
and the key idea here
 

217
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,350
and the key idea here
is to come up with a question that if

218
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
is to come up with a question that if
 

219
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,910
is to come up with a question that if
you knew the answer to that question

220
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
you knew the answer to that question
 

221
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,110
you knew the answer to that question
you could reduce

222
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
you could reduce
 

223
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,589
you could reduce
the subproblem you're trying to solve to

224
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
the subproblem you're trying to solve to
 

225
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,309
the subproblem you're trying to solve to
smaller sub-problem solutions

226
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
smaller sub-problem solutions
 

227
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,949
smaller sub-problem solutions
so this question is sort of the

228
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
so this question is sort of the
 

229
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,630
so this question is sort of the
fundamental

so maybe

286
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
so maybe
 

287
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,830
so maybe
some people like this some people don't

288
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
some people like this some people don't

is to think about guessing the answer

290
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
is to think about guessing the answer
 

291
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,230
is to think about guessing the answer
to the question and so you know maybe

292
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
to the question and so you know maybe
 

293
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,110
to the question and so you know maybe
the the answer could be zero one or two

294
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
the the answer could be zero one or two
 

295
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,670
the the answer could be zero one or two
and uh my algorithm will say guess which

296
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
and uh my algorithm will say guess which
 

297
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,629
and uh my algorithm will say guess which
is the right answer

298
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
is the right answer
 

299
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,270
is the right answer
and i'll assume that my algorithm

300
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
and i'll assume that my algorithm
 

301
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,870
and i'll assume that my algorithm
correctly guesses the

302
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
correctly guesses the
 

303
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,909
correctly guesses the
answer and analyze that

304
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
answer and analyze that
 

305
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,430
answer and analyze that
so we can think of the program as going

306
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
so we can think of the program as going
 

307
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,189
so we can think of the program as going
straight through uh you know

308
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
straight through uh you know
 

309
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,110
straight through uh you know
guessing the answer and then recursing

310
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
guessing the answer and then recursing
 

311
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,749
guessing the answer and then recursing
and then combining the solutions however

312
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
and then combining the solutions however
 

313
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,270
and then combining the solutions however
but then at the end of course we can't

314
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
but then at the end of course we can't
 

315
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,790
but then at the end of course we can't
assume that the guess was correct

316
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
assume that the guess was correct
 

317
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,469
assume that the guess was correct
in fact we have to loop over all those

318
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
in fact we have to loop over all those
 

319
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,830
in fact we have to loop over all those
guesses so it's the same thing just

320
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
guesses so it's the same thing just
 

321
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,510
guesses so it's the same thing just
if you think of it this way there's less

322
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
if you think of it this way there's less
 

323
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,189
if you think of it this way there's less
looping in your program but when you

324
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
looping in your program but when you
 

325
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,029
looping in your program but when you
analyze it definitely the loop is really

326
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
analyze it definitely the loop is really
 

327
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,629
analyze it definitely the loop is really
there you have to pay for all the

328
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
there you have to pay for all the
 

329
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,029

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
okay uh then we need to make sure this
 

333
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,150
okay uh then we need to make sure this

we have base cases for the relation we

342
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
we have base cases for the relation we
 

343
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,230
we have base cases for the relation we
have to solve the original problem in

344
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
have to solve the original problem in
 

345
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,590
have to solve the original problem in
terms of these sub problems and then we

346
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
terms of these sub problems and then we
 

347
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,430
terms of these sub problems and then we
analyze the running time

348
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
analyze the running time
 

349
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,150
analyze the running time
usually as the number of sub-problems

350
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
usually as the number of sub-problems
 

351
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,469
usually as the number of sub-problems
times the non-recursive work in each

352
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
times the non-recursive work in each
 

353
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,510

in the relation so recursion is free

354
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
in the relation so recursion is free
 

355
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,629

because we're multiplying by the number

356
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
because we're multiplying by the number
 

357
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,230
because we're multiplying by the number
of subproblems you can also sum over the

358
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
of subproblems you can also sum over the
 

359
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,070
of subproblems you can also sum over the
sub-problems sometimes that gives you

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
sub-problems sometimes that gives you
 

361
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,909
sub-problems sometimes that gives you
a tighter bound and then of course we

362
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
a tighter bound and then of course we
 

363
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,110
a tighter bound and then of course we
also have to add on

364
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
also have to add on
 

365
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,710
also have to add on

449
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,790
the recursive shortest path from s to u
plus the weight of the edge okay so this

450
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
plus the weight of the edge okay so this
 

451
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,710
plus the weight of the edge okay so this
is the guessing or local brute force

452
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720

what we really want is the shortest suv

what we really want is the shortest suv
 

527
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,790
what we really want is the shortest suv
path but that's hard

529
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,909
path but that's hard
so we're going to break it up into

530
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
so we're going to break it up into
 

531
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,469
so we're going to break it up into
smaller pieces for each k

532
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
smaller pieces for each k
 

533

there are no negative weight cycles we

00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
there are no negative weight cycles we
 

543
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,030
there are no negative weight cycles we
only have to go up to v minus one

544
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
only have to go up to v minus one
 

545
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,829
only have to go up to v minus one
uh we prove that and we know then we're

546
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839
uh we prove that and we know then we're
 

547
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,750
uh we prove that and we know then we're

happy
 

549
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,070

but that's that's sort of the last thing

00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
but that's that's sort of the last thing
 

551

it's delta sub v minus 1 of sv

we can solve the original problem unless

there are negative weight cycles and we

there are negative weight cycles and we
use delta sub v

568
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
use delta sub v
 

569
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,150

of sv to check whether they're negative

that but that's the

that but that's the
 

575
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,949
that but that's the
all in the original problem and then we

576
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
all in the original problem and then we
 

577
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,670
all in the original problem and then we
can take

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
here
 

585
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,389

so remember this for a general graph

586
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
so remember this for a general graph
 

587
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,630
so remember this for a general graph
this has cycles so we can't use it

588
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
this has cycles so we can't use it
 

589
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,910
this has cycles so we can't use it
because we're just referring to

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
because we're just referring to

arbitrary delta of svs
 

593

arbitrary delta of svs
so there's no reason to expect no cycles

594
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
so there's no reason to expect no cycles
 

595
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,990
so there's no reason to expect no cycles
there

then if this whole thing has length at

k then this piece has length at most

622
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
k then this piece has length at most

k minus 1. so i only need to

624
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
k minus 1. so i only need to
 

625
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,350
k minus 1. so i only need to
do solve delta sub k minus 1 of sv

626
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
do solve delta sub k minus 1 of sv
 

627
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,190
do solve delta sub k minus 1 of sv
here and so that's what i wrote sorry i

628
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
here and so that's what i wrote sorry i
 

629
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,389
here and so that's what i wrote sorry i
have s u that's what i wrote here

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,269
have s u that's what i wrote here
there's one other thing which is as i

632
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
there's one other thing which is as i
 

633
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,870
there's one other thing which is as i
mentioned a little while ago

635
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,710

it could be that we use fewer than k

636
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
it could be that we use fewer than k
 

637
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,310
it could be that we use fewer than k
edges and so

638
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
edges and so
 

639
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,310
edges and so
let's consider the case where we don't

640
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
let's consider the case where we don't
 

641
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,509
let's consider the case where we don't
follow a last edge

642
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
follow a last edge
 

643
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,550
follow a last edge
and we just add to this min the

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
and we just add to this min the
 

645
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,550
and we just add to this min the
uh shortest path using at most k minus

647
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,470

one edges that's one option

648
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
one edges that's one option
 

649
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,630
one edges that's one option
for having at most k edges if we wrote

650
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
for having at most k edges if we wrote
 

651
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,829
for having at most k edges if we wrote
equality here

652
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
equality here
 

653
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,150
equality here
then we would remove that like the last

654
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
then we would remove that like the last
 

655
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,550
then we would remove that like the last

okay good

658
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
okay good
 

659
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,150

so the key observation here is that this

660
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
so the key observation here is that this

increasing k

670
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
increasing k
 

671
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,710
increasing k
all of the references from delta sub k

672
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
all of the references from delta sub k
 

673
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,790
all of the references from delta sub k
are in terms of delta sub k minus 1

674
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
are in terms of delta sub k minus 1
 

675
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,790
are in terms of delta sub k minus 1
and so this is now magically acyclic

676
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
and so this is now magically acyclic
 

677
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,509
and so this is now magically acyclic
this is why bellman ford worked

678
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
this is why bellman ford worked
 

679
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,670
this is why bellman ford worked

way we're taking our graph that cyclic

682
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
way we're taking our graph that cyclic
 

683
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,069
way we're taking our graph that cyclic
and by spreading it out over various

684
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
and by spreading it out over various
 

685
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,990
and by spreading it out over various
copies of k and referencing always the

686
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
copies of k and referencing always the
 

687
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,269
copies of k and referencing always the
smaller one

688
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
smaller one
 

689
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,509
smaller one
we get an acyclic graph acyclic

690
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
we get an acyclic graph acyclic
 

691
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,389

that's this theta and then
 

711
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,670
that's this theta and then
some overall sub problems so sum over k

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
the size of e and then we sum there's no
 

727
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,190

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
k in this formula so we just multiply by
 

729
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,069
k in this formula so we just multiply by
v and we get v

730

but essentially the same computation
 

741
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,069

okay a few lectures ago we saw johnson's

754
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
okay a few lectures ago we saw johnson's
 

755
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,389
okay a few lectures ago we saw johnson's

very well so

758
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
very well so
 

759
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,430
very well so
one option we could use is just

760
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
one option we could use is just
 

761
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,430
one option we could use is just
this same set of sub problems but for

762
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
this same set of sub problems but for
 

763
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,430
this same set of sub problems but for
all u and v

764
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
all u and v
 

765
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,870
all u and v
right so for u and v and v

766
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
right so for u and v and v
 

767
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,870
right so for u and v and v
that's what we really care about um and

768
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
that's what we really care about um and
 

769
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,150
that's what we really care about um and
then we could say

770
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
then we could say
 

771
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,590
then we could say
k up to v something like that

772
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
k up to v something like that
 

773
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,910
k up to v something like that
so this would work but it would give the

774
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
so this would work but it would give the
 

775
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,269
so this would work but it would give the
same running time as

776
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
same running time as
 

777
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,590
same running time as
running bellman ford v times this is one

778
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
running bellman ford v times this is one
 

779
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,629
running bellman ford v times this is one
solution we know

780
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
solution we know
 

781
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,230
solution we know
but not the best solution we know for

782
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
but not the best solution we know for
 

783
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,829
but not the best solution we know for
how to solve shortest paths

784
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
how to solve shortest paths
 

785
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,750
how to solve shortest paths
so this would give v squared

786
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
so this would give v squared
 

787
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,430
so this would give v squared
e which is at most

788
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
e which is at most
 

789
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,750
e which is at most
v to the fourth for dense graphs it is

790
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
v to the fourth for dense graphs it is
 

791
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,430
v to the fourth for dense graphs it is
theta v to the fourth

792
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
theta v to the fourth
 

793
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,550
theta v to the fourth
so this is v times v times e um but

794
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
so this is v times v times e um but
 

795
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,470
so this is v times v times e um but
worst case is v to the fourth

796
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,480
worst case is v to the fourth
 

797
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,910
worst case is v to the fourth

799
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,990

801
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,030

almost identical but gives v cubed

802
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
almost identical but gives v cubed
 

803
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,150
almost identical but gives v cubed

839
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,790

starting at 1 for convenience so let's

840
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
starting at 1 for convenience so let's
 

841
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,189
starting at 1 for convenience so let's
see why

842
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
see why
 

843
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,629
see why
and then we're going to define some sub

844
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
and then we're going to define some sub
 

845
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,710
and then we're going to define some sub
problems which are

or i could go from u to one to v and
 

925
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,790
or i could go from u to one to v and
then how about with one and two and one

926
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
then how about with one and two and one
 

927
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,829

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
slight tweak but it turns out this uh

939
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,550

okay this is uh v cubed sub problems

940
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
okay this is uh v cubed sub problems
 

941
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,910
okay this is uh v cubed sub problems
two choices for u and v and i have uh

942
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
two choices for u and v and i have uh
 

943
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,470
two choices for u and v and i have uh
v choices for sorry i have v choices for

944
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480

00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
roughly v cubed of these
 

949
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,749
roughly v cubed of these
uh but the key thing is that sounds like

950
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
uh but the key thing is that sounds like
 

951
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,949
uh but the key thing is that sounds like
a lot

952
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
a lot
 

953
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,389
a lot
but the relation becomes cheaper now

954
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
but the relation becomes cheaper now
 

955
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,590
but the relation becomes cheaper now
because i can just write delta u

956
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
because i can just write delta u
 

957
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,150
because i can just write delta u

okay it's a strange it's a strange

972
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
okay it's a strange it's a strange
 

973
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,750
okay it's a strange it's a strange
formula because we're using

974
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
formula because we're using
 

975
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,990
formula because we're using
indices like k for vertices also um

976
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
indices like k for vertices also um
 

977
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,310
indices like k for vertices also um
as well as u and v for vertices but

978
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
as well as u and v for vertices but
 

979
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,110
as well as u and v for vertices but
we're also using k

980
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
we're also using k
 

981
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,789
we're also using k
as a counter but we can do this because

982
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
as a counter but we can do this because
 

983
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,470
as a counter but we can do this because
our vertices are numbered

984
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
our vertices are numbered
 

985
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,310
our vertices are numbered
okay so the idea is the following we

986
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
okay so the idea is the following we
 

987
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,990
okay so the idea is the following we
have vertex u

988
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
have vertex u
 

989
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,789
have vertex u
we have a vertex v and we've already

990
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
we have a vertex v and we've already
 

991
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,710
we have a vertex v and we've already
found the shortest path

992
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
found the shortest path
 

993
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,950
found the shortest path
that uses vertices 1 through k minus 1

994
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
that uses vertices 1 through k minus 1
 

995
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,750
that uses vertices 1 through k minus 1
that's what this quantity is so it could

996
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
that's what this quantity is so it could
 

997
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,870
that's what this quantity is so it could
be

998
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
be
 

999
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,230
be
and now we're thinking we're trying to

1000
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
and now we're thinking we're trying to
 

1001
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,230
and now we're thinking we're trying to
add in this vertex k and think about

1002
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
add in this vertex k and think about
 

1003
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,510
add in this vertex k and think about
what are all the paths that could go

1004
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
what are all the paths that could go
 

1005
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,230
what are all the paths that could go
from u to v using one up to k

1006
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
from u to v using one up to k
 

1007
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,830
from u to v using one up to k
well it could be the shortest path from

1008
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
well it could be the shortest path from
 

1009
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,590
well it could be the shortest path from
u to v using one up to k doesn't use

1010
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
u to v using one up to k doesn't use
 

1011
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,549
u to v using one up to k doesn't use
vertex k

1012
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
vertex k
 

1013
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,549
vertex k
that's the first option just use

1014
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
that's the first option just use
 

1015
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,390
that's the first option just use
vertices one up to k minus one maybe we

1016
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
vertices one up to k minus one maybe we
 

1017
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,029
vertices one up to k minus one maybe we
don't need

1018
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
don't need
 

1019
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,990
don't need
to use k or it could be that the path

1020
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
to use k or it could be that the path
 

1021
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,190
to use k or it could be that the path
goes through k

1022
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
goes through k
 

1023
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,310
goes through k
well it starts at u and it goes to k

1024
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
well it starts at u and it goes to k
 

1025
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,110
well it starts at u and it goes to k
and then it goes from k to v okay all

1026
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
and then it goes from k to v okay all
 

1027
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,070
and then it goes from k to v okay all
using

1028
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
using
 

1029
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,590
using
for simple paths if we assume there are

1030
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
for simple paths if we assume there are
 

1031
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,110
for simple paths if we assume there are
no negative weight cycles and you have

1032
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
no negative weight cycles and you have
 

1033
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,950
no negative weight cycles and you have
to run down and forward to detect them

1034
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
to run down and forward to detect them
 

1035
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,549
to run down and forward to detect them
but assuming no negative weight cycles

1036
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
but assuming no negative weight cycles
 

1037
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,710
but assuming no negative weight cycles
the shortest path from u to v through k

1038
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
the shortest path from u to v through k
 

1039
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,029
the shortest path from u to v through k
must start by using vertices less than k

1040
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
must start by using vertices less than k
 

1041
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,270
must start by using vertices less than k
and then use vertices less than k again

1042
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
and then use vertices less than k again
 

1043
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,470
and then use vertices less than k again
and that's what i've written here it's

1044
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
and that's what i've written here it's
 

1045
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,190
and that's what i've written here it's
from u to k using k minus 1

1046
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
from u to k using k minus 1
 

1047
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,710
from u to k using k minus 1
up to k minus 1 labels and from k to v

1048
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
up to k minus 1 labels and from k to v
 

1049
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,270
up to k minus 1 labels and from k to v
using labels up to k minus one okay the

1050
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
using labels up to k minus one okay the
 

1051
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,070
using labels up to k minus one okay the
cool thing here

1052
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
cool thing here
 

1053
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,150
cool thing here
is the min only has two terms so this

1054
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
is the min only has two terms so this
 

1055
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,669
is the min only has two terms so this
takes constant time

1056
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
takes constant time
 

1057
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,590
takes constant time
non-recursive work so this is uh

1058
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
non-recursive work so this is uh
 

1059
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,110
non-recursive work so this is uh
k is not on the shortest path and this

1060
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
k is not on the shortest path and this
 

1061
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,470
k is not on the shortest path and this
is k is on the shortest path

1062
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480

 

1063
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,230

cool so this is constant non-recursive

1064
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
cool so this is constant non-recursive
 

1065
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,110
cool so this is constant non-recursive
work

1066
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120

 

1067
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,350

so if we jump ahead to the running time

1068
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
so if we jump ahead to the running time
 

1069
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,110
so if we jump ahead to the running time
with this algorithm we get

1070
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120

 

1071
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,950

the number of sub-problems which is v

1072
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
the number of sub-problems which is v
 

1073
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,630
the number of sub-problems which is v
cubed times

1074
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
cubed times
 

1075
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,150
cubed times
the number the amount of work per

1076
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
the number the amount of work per
 

1077
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,909
the number the amount of work per
sub-problem which is constant

1078
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
sub-problem which is constant
 

1079
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,190
sub-problem which is constant
so that's just a v cubed algorithm

1080
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
so that's just a v cubed algorithm
 

1081
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,549
so that's just a v cubed algorithm
for dense graphs this is really good

1082
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
for dense graphs this is really good
 

1083
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,990
for dense graphs this is really good
this is when e is v squared then

1084
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
this is when e is v squared then
 

1085
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,909
this is when e is v squared then
this is the same thing as v times e so

1086
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:37,919
this is the same thing as v times e so
 

1087
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,430
this is the same thing as v times e so
as good as bellman ford

1088
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
as good as bellman ford
 

1089
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,350
as good as bellman ford
uh it's not as good as johnson for

1090
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
uh it's not as good as johnson for
 

1091
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,710
uh it's not as good as johnson for
sparse graphs

1092
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720

1093
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,669
sparse graphs
sparse graphs remember or in general

johnson we got v squared log n

1098
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
johnson we got v squared log n
 

1099
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,470
johnson we got v squared log n
plus v e and this is always spending v

1100
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
plus v e and this is always spending v
 

1101
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,190

but it's cool because it's a very simple
 

1105
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,710

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
quickly write the topological order
 

1109
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,630
quickly write the topological order
this is

1110
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640

 

1111
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,110

all we need is to guarantee that we

1112
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
all we need is to guarantee that we
 

1113
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,950
all we need is to guarantee that we
solve problems in increasing k

00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
so if you wanted to write this algorithm
 

1131
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,310

base case here is

1152
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:55,480

 

1153
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,630

uv0 so i have to define what that means

1154
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
uv0 so i have to define what that means
 

1155
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:58,950
uv0 so i have to define what that means
but

1156
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
but
 

1157
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,590
but
when k equals zero the one through k set

1158
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
when k equals zero the one through k set
 

1159
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,630
when k equals zero the one through k set
is empty

1160
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
is empty
 

1161
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,630
is empty
so all i'm allowed to use are use my

1162
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
so all i'm allowed to use are use my
 

1163

1165
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,029
vertices u and v
and so there are three cases for this 0

1166
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
and so there are three cases for this 0
 

1167
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,590
and so there are three cases for this 0
if u equals v

1168
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
if u equals v
 

1169
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,230
if u equals v
it's w of uv if there's an edge

1170
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
it's w of uv if there's an edge
 

1171
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:25,029
it's w of uv if there's an edge
from u to v and it's infinity otherwise

1172
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039

 

1173
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,950

okay but easy base case constant time

1174
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
okay but easy base case constant time
 

1175
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,710
okay but easy base case constant time
for each

1176
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
for each
 

1177
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,149
for each
and then the original problems we want

1178
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
and then the original problems we want
 

1179
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,270
and then the original problems we want
to solve

1180
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280

 

1181
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,190

are delta u v sides of v

1182
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
are delta u v sides of v
 

1183
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,549
are delta u v sides of v
because i number the vertices one

1184
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
because i number the vertices one
 

1185
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,870
because i number the vertices one
through size of v and if k equals size

1186
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
through size of v and if k equals size
 

1187
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,230
through size of v and if k equals size
of v that means i get to use all my

1188
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
of v that means i get to use all my
 

1189
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,430
of v that means i get to use all my
vertices so that is

1190
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
vertices so that is
 

1191
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,350
vertices so that is
regular shortest paths this is assuming

1192
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
regular shortest paths this is assuming
 

1193
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,029
regular shortest paths this is assuming
no negative weight cycles

1194
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039

 

1195
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,470

okay we already know how to do negative

1196
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
okay we already know how to do negative
 

1197
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,990
okay we already know how to do negative
weight cycle detection so i'm not going

1198
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
weight cycle detection so i'm not going
 

1199
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,190
weight cycle detection so i'm not going
to

1200
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
to
 

1201
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,310
to
talk about that again but then this will

1202
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
talk about that again but then this will
 

1203
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,549
talk about that again but then this will
be

1204
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
be
 

1205
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,070
be
my shortest pathways because uh yeah

1206
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
my shortest pathways because uh yeah
 

1207
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,990
my shortest pathways because uh yeah
i implicitly assumed here that my path

1208
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
i implicitly assumed here that my path
 

1209
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,990
i implicitly assumed here that my path
was simple because

1210
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
was simple because
 

1211
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,789
was simple because
i imagine that i only use k once zero or

1212
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799
i imagine that i only use k once zero or
 

1213
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,669
i imagine that i only use k once zero or
one time

1214
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
one time
 

1215
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,110
one time
and that's true if there are no negative

1216
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
and that's true if there are no negative
 

1217
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,590
and that's true if there are no negative
weight cycles

1218
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
weight cycles
 

1219
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,590
weight cycles
cool and we already did the time part of

1220
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
cool and we already did the time part of
 

1221
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,950
cool and we already did the time part of
sort bot

1222
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
sort bot
 

1223
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,789
sort bot
so v cubed algorithm very simple

1224
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
so v cubed algorithm very simple
 

1225
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,990
so v cubed algorithm very simple
basically five lines of code and you've

1226
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,000
basically five lines of code and you've
 

1227
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,510
basically five lines of code and you've
got all pair shortest paths

1228
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
got all pair shortest paths
 

1229
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,950
got all pair shortest paths
and if your graph is dense this is a

1230
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
and if your graph is dense this is a
 

1231
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,710
and if your graph is dense this is a
great running time if your grass

1232
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
great running time if your grass
 

1233
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,149
great running time if your grass
graph is not dense you should use

1234
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
graph is not dense you should use
 

1235
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,149
graph is not dense you should use
johnson like you will

1236
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
johnson like you will
 

1237
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,830
johnson like you will
and or like you have implemented in your

1238
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
and or like you have implemented in your
 

1239
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,590
and or like you have implemented in your
problem set

1240
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
problem set
 

1241
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,350
problem set
yeah so how was this compared to just

1242
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
yeah so how was this compared to just
 

1243
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,789
yeah so how was this compared to just
running dijkstra's outdoor a bunch of

1244
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
running dijkstra's outdoor a bunch of
 

1245
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,270
running dijkstra's outdoor a bunch of
times

1246
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
times
 

1247
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,390
times
ah what about using dijkstra so let's

1248
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
ah what about using dijkstra so let's
 

1249
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,909
ah what about using dijkstra so let's
compute so uh running dijkstra v times

1250
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
compute so uh running dijkstra v times
 

1251
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:46,710
compute so uh running dijkstra v times
is

1252
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
is
 

1253
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,830
is
the running time of um

1254
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840

 

1255
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,070

johnson

1256
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080

 

1257
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,990

so running dijkstra a bunch of times is

1258
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
so running dijkstra a bunch of times is
 

1259
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,750
so running dijkstra a bunch of times is
great if your graph has

1260
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
great if your graph has
 

1261
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,590
great if your graph has
only non-negative edge weights then you

1262
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,600
only non-negative edge weights then you
 

1263
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,350
only non-negative edge weights then you
should just run dijkstra

1264
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
should just run dijkstra
 

1265
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,149
should just run dijkstra
you get this running time and for sparse

1266
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
you get this running time and for sparse
 

1267
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,590
you get this running time and for sparse
graphs this is superior

1268
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
graphs this is superior
 

1269
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,710
graphs this is superior
if you have negative edge weights you

1270
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
if you have negative edge weights you
 

1271
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,390
if you have negative edge weights you
should run johnson which is bellman ford

1272
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
should run johnson which is bellman ford
 

1273
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,669
should run johnson which is bellman ford
once and then dijkstra

1274
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
once and then dijkstra
 

1275
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,630
once and then dijkstra
v times and we're comparing this to

1276
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
v times and we're comparing this to
 

1277
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,870
v times and we're comparing this to
the cubed which we just got

1278
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
the cubed which we just got
 

1279
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,110
the cubed which we just got
so this i mean how these compare depends

1280
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
so this i mean how these compare depends
 

1281
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,310
so this i mean how these compare depends
on how v and e relate

1282
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
on how v and e relate
 

1283
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,750
on how v and e relate
so on the one hand maybe uh v

1284
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
so on the one hand maybe uh v
 

1285
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,950
so on the one hand maybe uh v
is theta e that's what i would call a

1286
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
is theta e that's what i would call a
 

1287
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,149
is theta e that's what i would call a
very sparse graph it's quite common

1288
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
very sparse graph it's quite common
 

1289
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,270
very sparse graph it's quite common
then the running time we get here

1290
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
then the running time we get here
 

1291
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,789
then the running time we get here
is uh v squared

1292
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
is uh v squared
 

1293
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,950
is uh v squared
log v okay roughly v squared

1294
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960
log v okay roughly v squared
 

1295
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,430
log v okay roughly v squared
on the other hand if we have a very

1296
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
on the other hand if we have a very
 

1297
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,110
on the other hand if we have a very
dense graph v is theta

1298
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
dense graph v is theta
 

1299
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,110
dense graph v is theta
e squared which for simple graphs the

1300
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
e squared which for simple graphs the
 

1301
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,870
e squared which for simple graphs the
most we could hope for

1302
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:52,880
most we could hope for
 

1303
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,909
most we could hope for
uh then this running time

1304
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
uh then this running time
 

1305
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,830
uh then this running time
is v cubed

1306
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
is v cubed
 

1307
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,990
is v cubed
okay so if you know the v is near e

1308
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
okay so if you know the v is near e
 

1309
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,510
okay so if you know the v is near e
squared then this is giving you

1310
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
squared then this is giving you
 

1311
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,310
squared then this is giving you
v cubed anyway from the ve term so why

1312
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
v cubed anyway from the ve term so why
 

1313
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,350
v cubed anyway from the ve term so why
not just use

1314
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
not just use
 

1315
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,870
not just use
this algorithm and often you know a

1316
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:08,880
this algorithm and often you know a
 

1317
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,390
this algorithm and often you know a
priori whether your graph is very sparse

1318
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
priori whether your graph is very sparse
 

1319
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,990
priori whether your graph is very sparse
or very dense or somewhere in between

1320
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
or very dense or somewhere in between
 

1321
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,269
or very dense or somewhere in between
if it's somewhere in between you should

1322
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
if it's somewhere in between you should
 

1323
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,269
if it's somewhere in between you should
still use johnson's algorithm because

1324
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
still use johnson's algorithm because
 

1325
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,710
still use johnson's algorithm because
you're going to get the benefit from

1326
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
you're going to get the benefit from
 

1327
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,430
you're going to get the benefit from
sparsity

1328
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
sparsity
 

1329
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,350
sparsity
and only have to pay this ve instead of

1330
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
and only have to pay this ve instead of
 

1331
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,870
and only have to pay this ve instead of
the v cubed

1332
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
the v cubed
 

1333
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,470
the v cubed
but if you know ahead of time you know

1334
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
but if you know ahead of time you know
 

1335

1411
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,230
you think okay i'm going to multiply 4
and 3 first because that has a higher

1412
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
and 3 first because that has a higher
 

1413
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,590
and 3 first because that has a higher
precedence and then i'll add

1414
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
precedence and then i'll add
 

1415
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,909
precedence and then i'll add
the results up but uh what i'm going to

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,230

okay so you can try all the combinations

1502
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,240
okay so you can try all the combinations
 

1503
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,430
okay so you can try all the combinations
here if i

1504
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
here if i
 

1505
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,029
here if i
for example take the product of 4 times

1506
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
for example take the product of 4 times
 

1507
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,710
for example take the product of 4 times
3 i get 12.

1508
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
3 i get 12.
 

1509
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,029
3 i get 12.
for if i do that first i get 12. then if

1510
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,039
for if i do that first i get 12. then if
 

1511
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,590
for if i do that first i get 12. then if
i add 5 and 7 i get

1512
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
i add 5 and 7 i get
 

1513
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,110
i add 5 and 7 i get
24 which is less than 88.

1514
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
24 which is less than 88.
 

1515
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,430
24 which is less than 88.
and i checked them all and this one is

1516
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
and i checked them all and this one is
 

1517
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,310
and i checked them all and this one is
the maximum

1518
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
the maximum
 

1519
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,590
the maximum
for that example okay so

1520
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:35,600
for that example okay so
 

1521
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,269
for that example okay so
interesting problem um sort of it's a

1522
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
interesting problem um sort of it's a
 

1523
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,190
interesting problem um sort of it's a
bit of a toy problem but it's motivated

1524
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
bit of a toy problem but it's motivated
 

1525
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,710
bit of a toy problem but it's motivated
by lots of

1526
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
by lots of
 

1527
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,230
by lots of
actual problems which i won't go into

1528
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
actual problems which i won't go into
 

1529
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,389
actual problems which i won't go into
here

1530
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
here
 

1531
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,789
here
so to apply this framework

1532
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
so to apply this framework
 

1533
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,070
so to apply this framework
you know we need to identify some

1534
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080
you know we need to identify some
 

1535
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,830
you know we need to identify some
sub-problems this is a

1536
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:55,840
sub-problems this is a
 

1537
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,590
sub-problems this is a
sequence problem we're given a sequence

1538
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
sequence problem we're given a sequence
 

1539
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,950
sequence problem we're given a sequence
of symbols

1540
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
of symbols
 

1541
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,389
of symbols
and so natural things to try our

1542
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
and so natural things to try our
 

1543
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,789
and so natural things to try our
prefixes suffixes and substrings

1544
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
prefixes suffixes and substrings
 

1545
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,149
prefixes suffixes and substrings
i'm going to jump ahead and think about

1546
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
i'm going to jump ahead and think about
 

1547
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,909
i'm going to jump ahead and think about
the relation first

1548
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
the relation first
 

1549
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,669
the relation first
i want to identify some question about

1550
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
i want to identify some question about
 

1551
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,190
i want to identify some question about
the sub-problem

1552
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
the sub-problem
 

1553
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,510
the sub-problem
or its solution that would let me reduce

1554
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
or its solution that would let me reduce
 

1555
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,870
or its solution that would let me reduce
to smaller sub problems

1556
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
to smaller sub problems
 

1557
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,310
to smaller sub problems
this is a little trickier this is very

1558
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,320
this is a little trickier this is very
 

1559
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,149
this is a little trickier this is very
different we're not always doing

1560
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:16,159
different we're not always doing
 

1561
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,990
different we're not always doing
something on the left or on the right

1562
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
something on the left or on the right
 

1563
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,590
something on the left or on the right
or we can't assume there's something

1564
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
or we can't assume there's something
 

1565
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,590
or we can't assume there's something
happening on the left because maybe we

1566
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
happening on the left because maybe we
 

1567
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,669
happening on the left because maybe we
take a product in the middle first

1568
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
take a product in the middle first
 

1569
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,350
take a product in the middle first
if i take a product in the middle first

1570
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
if i take a product in the middle first
 

1571
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,350
if i take a product in the middle first
then i have some result here

1572
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
then i have some result here
 

1573
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,870
then i have some result here
but i still have three things i have the

1574
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
but i still have three things i have the
 

1575
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,310
but i still have three things i have the
thing to the left i have the thing in

1576
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,320
thing to the left i have the thing in
 

1577
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,029
thing to the left i have the thing in
the middle

1578
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039
the middle
 

1579
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,549
the middle
and i have the thing on the right it

1580
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:32,559
and i have the thing on the right it
 

1581
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,990
and i have the thing on the right it
turns out to be very messy to think

1582
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
turns out to be very messy to think
 

1583
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,549
turns out to be very messy to think
about what the first operation is

1584
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:36,559
about what the first operation is
 

1585
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,190
about what the first operation is
because we can think of this as a tree

1586
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200
because we can think of this as a tree
 

1587
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,870
because we can think of this as a tree
um

1588
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
um
 

1589
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,590
um
where we take a product here we take a

1590
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
where we take a product here we take a
 

1591
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:43,990
where we take a product here we take a
sum

1592
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
sum
 

1593
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,070
sum
of 7 and 4

1594
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080

 

1595
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,510

and 3 and 5 over here and then take the

1596
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:51,520
and 3 and 5 over here and then take the
 

1597
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,190
and 3 and 5 over here and then take the
product at the root

1598
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
product at the root
 

1599
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,630
product at the root
but i don't know what the tree is right

1600
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,640
but i don't know what the tree is right
 

1601
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,149
but i don't know what the tree is right
i only know these numbers and these

1602
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
i only know these numbers and these
 

1603
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,590
i only know these numbers and these
operators but i don't know how to

1604
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
operators but i don't know how to
 

1605
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,669
operators but i don't know how to
organize this tree

1606
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
organize this tree
 

1607
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,110
organize this tree
and so the idea is if you think of this

1608
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
and so the idea is if you think of this
 

1609
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,510
and so the idea is if you think of this
tree what is the one thing that's the

1610
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
tree what is the one thing that's the
 

1611
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,950
tree what is the one thing that's the
easiest to identify

1612
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
easiest to identify
 

1613
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,669
easiest to identify
it's the root the root corresponds to

1614
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
it's the root the root corresponds to
 

1615
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:07,990
it's the root the root corresponds to
the

1616
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
the
 

1617
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,630
the
last operation i do in this computation

1618
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
last operation i do in this computation
 

1619
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,870
last operation i do in this computation
the last thing i did was take a product

1620
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
the last thing i did was take a product
 

1621
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,510
the last thing i did was take a product
and that's a lot easier because uh if i

1622
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:15,520
and that's a lot easier because uh if i
 

1623
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,149
and that's a lot easier because uh if i
guess

1624
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159
guess
 

1625
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,669
guess
who's at the root which operator is at

1626
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
who's at the root which operator is at
 

1627
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,830
who's at the root which operator is at
the root that naturally decomposes into

1628
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,840
the root that naturally decomposes into
 

1629
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,789
the root that naturally decomposes into
the left subtree

1630
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
the left subtree
 

1631
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,269
the left subtree
and the right subtree and those will

1632
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
and the right subtree and those will
 

1633
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,149
and the right subtree and those will
always be

1634
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:24,159
always be
 

1635
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,470
always be
substrings we kind of know this this

1636
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,480
substrings we kind of know this this
 

1637
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,470
substrings we kind of know this this
node corresponds to everything left of

1638
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
node corresponds to everything left of
 

1639
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,909
node corresponds to everything left of
this operator

1640
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:31,919
this operator
 

1641
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,549
this operator
and this sub substring or this

1642
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
and this sub substring or this
 

1643
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,310
and this sub substring or this
subtree corresponds to everything to the

1644
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
subtree corresponds to everything to the
 

1645
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,830
subtree corresponds to everything to the
right of the operator

1646
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
right of the operator
 

1647
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,669
right of the operator
so this is our idea

1648
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:43,679

 

1649
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,470

is we're going to guess

1650
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,480

 

1651
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,590

which operation

1652
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,600
which operation
 

1653
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,350
which operation
star i is evaluated

1654
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
star i is evaluated
 

1655
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,750
star i is evaluated
last

1656
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760

 

1657
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,190

or in other words at the root

1658
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200

 

1659
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,230

so this is a question it has uh

1660
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
so this is a question it has uh
 

1661
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,710
so this is a question it has uh
n possible answers i guess actually n

1662
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:08,720
n possible answers i guess actually n
 

1663
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,269
n possible answers i guess actually n
minus one

1664
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
minus one
 

1665
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,350
minus one
from operator one to operator n minus

1666
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
from operator one to operator n minus
 

1667
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,389
from operator one to operator n minus
one

1668
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:12,399
one
 

1669
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,669
one
and so uh we'll just brute force all

1670
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
and so uh we'll just brute force all
 

1671
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,990
and so uh we'll just brute force all
those choices

1672
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
those choices
 

1673
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,710
those choices
okay so i wanted to start here because

1674
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
okay so i wanted to start here because
 

1675
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,230
okay so i wanted to start here because
uh to realize that

1676
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,240
uh to realize that
 

1677
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,029
uh to realize that
if i choose some star i in the middle

1678
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
if i choose some star i in the middle
 

1679
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,549
if i choose some star i in the middle
which might be the right thing like in

1680
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
which might be the right thing like in
 

1681
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,509
which might be the right thing like in
this example

1682
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:27,519
this example
 

1683
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,990
this example
star i is the the middle one middle

1684
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,000
star i is the the middle one middle
 

1685
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,430
star i is the the middle one middle
operator

1686
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:31,440
operator
 

1687
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,190
operator
i naturally decompose into everything to

1688
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
i naturally decompose into everything to
 

1689
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,630
i naturally decompose into everything to
the left of that operator and everything

1690
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
the left of that operator and everything
 

1691
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,070
the left of that operator and everything
to the right of that operator

1692
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,080
to the right of that operator
 

1693
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,870
to the right of that operator
this is a prefix this is a suffix

1694
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:40,880
this is a prefix this is a suffix
 

1695
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,710
this is a prefix this is a suffix
so you might think oh my sub problems

1696
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
so you might think oh my sub problems
 

1697
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,630
so you might think oh my sub problems
are all prefixes and all suffixes but

1698
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,640
are all prefixes and all suffixes but
 

1699
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,549
are all prefixes and all suffixes but
that would be wrong

1700
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:46,559
that would be wrong
 

1701
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,430
that would be wrong
because if you have a bunch of operators

1702
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
because if you have a bunch of operators
 

1703
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,909
because if you have a bunch of operators
and say you choose this one to be last

1704
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:53,919

 

1705
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,669

so i have a prefix here and a suffix

1706
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:55,679
so i have a prefix here and a suffix
 

1707
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,990
so i have a prefix here and a suffix
here and then there'll be some

1708
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
here and then there'll be some
 

1709
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,789
here and then there'll be some
within this suffix i'll choose some

1710
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
within this suffix i'll choose some
 

1711
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,190
within this suffix i'll choose some
operator to be the root of that one

1712
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
operator to be the root of that one
 

1713
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,669
operator to be the root of that one
and i have a prefix and a suffix of this

1714
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
and i have a prefix and a suffix of this
 

1715
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,870
and i have a prefix and a suffix of this
suffix but

1716
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
suffix but
 

1717
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,789
suffix but
in particular i will have to evaluate

1718
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:08,799
in particular i will have to evaluate
 

1719
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,710
in particular i will have to evaluate
this sub-problem which is a prefix of a

1720
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720
this sub-problem which is a prefix of a
 

1721
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,909
this sub-problem which is a prefix of a
suffix in other words

1722
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:11,919
suffix in other words
 

1723
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,310
suffix in other words
a substring so never use a mixture of

1724
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,320
a substring so never use a mixture of
 

1725
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,750
a substring so never use a mixture of
prefixes and suffixes

1726
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:15,760
prefixes and suffixes
 

1727
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,509
prefixes and suffixes
if you need both you probably need all

1728
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
if you need both you probably need all
 

1729
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,830
if you need both you probably need all
sub strings

1730
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:19,840
sub strings
 

1731
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:27,990
sub strings
so our sub problems

1732
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
so our sub problems
 

1733
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,389
so our sub problems
are going to be substrings

1734
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:36,399

 

1735
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,389

okay i'm not going to write the sub

1736
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
okay i'm not going to write the sub
 

1737
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,750
okay i'm not going to write the sub
problems quite yet because there's

1738
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:39,760
problems quite yet because there's
 

1739
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,029
problems quite yet because there's
another idea

1740
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:41,039
another idea
 

1741
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,269
another idea
we need so what do i need to do with a

1742
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
we need so what do i need to do with a
 

1743
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,350
we need so what do i need to do with a
substring

1744
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,360
substring
 

1745
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,870
substring
so i'm going to guess the middle

1746
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:46,880
so i'm going to guess the middle
 

1747
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,710
so i'm going to guess the middle
operator and then evaluate the left

1748
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:48,720
operator and then evaluate the left
 

1749
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,870
operator and then evaluate the left
substring evaluate the right substring

1750
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
substring evaluate the right substring
 

1751
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,990
substring evaluate the right substring
what am i trying to do with those

1752
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,000
what am i trying to do with those
 

1753
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,230
what am i trying to do with those
substrings i guess i'm trying to solve

1754
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
substrings i guess i'm trying to solve
 

1755
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,149
substrings i guess i'm trying to solve
this problem which is

1756
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:56,159
this problem which is
 

1757
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,990
this problem which is
place parentheses in order to maximize

1758
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,000
place parentheses in order to maximize
 

1759
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,430
place parentheses in order to maximize
the result and then return what the

1760
00:32:59,430 --> 00:32:59,440
the result and then return what the
 

1761
00:32:59,440 --> 00:32:59,909
the result and then return what the
result

1762
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
result
 

1763
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,710
result
is okay and i can use parent pointers to

1764
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
is okay and i can use parent pointers to
 

1765
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,990
is okay and i can use parent pointers to
reconstruct what the

1766
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,000
reconstruct what the
 

1767
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,070
reconstruct what the
parentheses actually are

1768
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080

 

1769
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,870

so is it enough once i guess what the

1770
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:10,880
so is it enough once i guess what the
 

1771
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,310
so is it enough once i guess what the
last operator is

1772
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
last operator is
 

1773
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,310
last operator is
is it enough to maximize the part to the

1774
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,320
is it enough to maximize the part to the
 

1775
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,870
is it enough to maximize the part to the
right and maximize the part to the left

1776
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
right and maximize the part to the left
 

1777
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,269
right and maximize the part to the left
will that always maximize my sum or

1778
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:19,279
will that always maximize my sum or
 

1779
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,789
will that always maximize my sum or
product according to what this operator

1780
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:20,799
product according to what this operator
 

1781
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,470
product according to what this operator
is

1782
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
is
 

1783
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,389
is
and you think about it for a while yeah

1784
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
and you think about it for a while yeah
 

1785
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,789
and you think about it for a while yeah
if i want to maximize a sum

1786
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:26,799
if i want to maximize a sum
 

1787
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,029
if i want to maximize a sum
i should maximize the two parts and if i

1788
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,039
i should maximize the two parts and if i
 

1789
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,549
i should maximize the two parts and if i
want to maximize a product i should

1790
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
want to maximize a product i should
 

1791
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,029
want to maximize a product i should
maximize the two parts that seems right

1792
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
maximize the two parts that seems right
 

1793
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,470
maximize the two parts that seems right
except i didn't say that my integers are

1794
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:36,480
except i didn't say that my integers are
 

1795
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,669
except i didn't say that my integers are
positive

1796
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:37,679
positive
 

1797
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,029
positive
so it's true if the integers are

1798
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
so it's true if the integers are
 

1799
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,789
so it's true if the integers are
positive but to make this problem more

1800
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
positive but to make this problem more
 

1801
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,669
positive but to make this problem more
interesting

1802
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
interesting
 

1803
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,269
interesting
we're going to allow the integers to be

1804
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
we're going to allow the integers to be
 

1805
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,870
we're going to allow the integers to be
negative

1806
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
negative
 

1807
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,789
negative
so for example uh 7

1808
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
so for example uh 7
 

1809
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,389
so for example uh 7
plus minus 4 times 3

1810
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
plus minus 4 times 3
 

1811
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,470
plus minus 4 times 3
plus minus 5. so i just added a couple

1812
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,480
plus minus 5. so i just added a couple
 

1813
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,909
plus minus 5. so i just added a couple
of minuses

1814
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
of minuses
 

1815
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,630
of minuses
to a couple of the numbers here

1816
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:00,640
to a couple of the numbers here
 

1817
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,310
to a couple of the numbers here
then it's no longer best to pair them

1818
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
then it's no longer best to pair them
 

1819
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,190
then it's no longer best to pair them
this way so if i pair them this way

1820
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,200
this way so if i pair them this way
 

1821
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,430
this way so if i pair them this way
like this or if i add parentheses this

1822
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,440
like this or if i add parentheses this
 

1823
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,950
like this or if i add parentheses this
way i get

1824
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:08,960
way i get
 

1825
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,790
way i get
3 here and i get minus 2 here

1826
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:12,800
3 here and i get minus 2 here
 

1827
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,149
3 here and i get minus 2 here
so i get product of that as negative 6

1828
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
so i get product of that as negative 6
 

1829
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,750
so i get product of that as negative 6
which is probably not the maximum in

1830
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
which is probably not the maximum in
 

1831
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,069
which is probably not the maximum in
fact i can do better i believe by

1832
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,079

 

1833
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,470

doing the left operator last

1834
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,480

 

1835
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,389

so this is a i claim the best

1836
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:30,399
so this is a i claim the best
 

1837
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,750
so this is a i claim the best
parenthesization if i remembered it

1838
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
parenthesization if i remembered it
 

1839
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,389
parenthesization if i remembered it
correctly

1840
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
correctly
 

1841
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,510
correctly
so this is minus two times minus four

1842
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
so this is minus two times minus four
 

1843
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,190
so this is minus two times minus four
is eight

1844
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,200

 

1845
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,510

uh plus seven is fifteen

1846
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,520
uh plus seven is fifteen
 

1847
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,710
uh plus seven is fifteen
okay so i got a positive number

1848
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
okay so i got a positive number
 

1849
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,829
okay so i got a positive number
definitely better than the negative

1850
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
definitely better than the negative
 

1851
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,629
definitely better than the negative
number i got

1852
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:46,639
number i got
 

1853
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,790
number i got
and i claim this is the best and the key

1854
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:48,800
and i claim this is the best and the key
 

1855
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,909
and i claim this is the best and the key
property here is

1856
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
property here is
 

1857
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,430
property here is
when we take a product of two negative

1858
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440
when we take a product of two negative
 

1859
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,030
when we take a product of two negative
numbers we get a positive number so

1860
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
numbers we get a positive number so
 

1861
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,990
numbers we get a positive number so
sometimes

1862
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
sometimes
 

1863
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,230
sometimes
you actually want to make things small

1864
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
you actually want to make things small
 

1865
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,030
you actually want to make things small
because small

1866
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
because small
 

1867
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,349
because small
might mean very negative you take two

1868
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
might mean very negative you take two
 

1869
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,069
might mean very negative you take two
very big

1870
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
very big
 

1871
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,310
very big
negative numbers very small negative

1872
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
negative numbers very small negative
 

1873
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,670

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,270
you take their product you get a very
big product positively

1878
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280
big product positively
 

1879
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,910
big product positively
because the signs cancel okay so this

1880
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:09,920
because the signs cancel okay so this
 

1881
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,030
because the signs cancel okay so this
seems tricky

1882
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
seems tricky
 

1883
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,790
seems tricky
we want to work on substrings but we

00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800
we want to work on substrings but we
 

1885

we want to work on substrings but we
don't know whether we're trying to

but that's not good maybe overall on
 

1895

00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:22,880
this entire expression i get
 

1897
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,190
this entire expression i get
negative a million and that's not what i

wanted i wanted to maximize the sum
so i need to i still need to solve the

but i also need to solve the min

1910
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,280

if i can solve max and min i'll know the

1914
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
if i can solve max and min i'll know the
 

1915
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,510
if i can solve max and min i'll know the
entire kind of range that i could get

1916
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520
entire kind of range that i could get
 

1917
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,829
entire kind of range that i could get
and i really only i'll care about men

1918
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
and i really only i'll care about men
 

1919

especially when it lets me go negative

1920
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
especially when it lets me go negative
 

1921
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,470
especially when it lets me go negative
but let's just solve it in all cases the

1922
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,480
but let's just solve it in all cases the
 

1923
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,150
but let's just solve it in all cases the
min and the max

1924
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,160
min and the max
 

1925
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,589
min and the max
and then just brute force the rest

1926
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:53,599
and then just brute force the rest
 

1927
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,310
and then just brute force the rest
that's what i'm going to write down

1928
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:56,320
that's what i'm going to write down
 

1929
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,270
that's what i'm going to write down
so that was some motivation on why we

1930
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
so that was some motivation on why we
 

1931
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,910
so that was some motivation on why we
are going to define subproblems this way

1932
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
are going to define subproblems this way
 

1933
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,470
are going to define subproblems this way
so i'm going to define x of i comma j

1934
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:04,480
so i'm going to define x of i comma j
 

1935
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,950
so i'm going to define x of i comma j
comma

1936
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:04,960

opt to be
 

1939
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,030
opt to be
so opt here is going to be either

1940
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
so opt here is going to be either
 

1941
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,310
so opt here is going to be either
min or max and this is my

1942
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,320
min or max and this is my
 

1943
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,790
min or max and this is my
sub problem expansion i really just care

1944
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
sub problem expansion i really just care
 

1945
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,589
sub problem expansion i really just care
about max

1946
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:17,599
about max
 

1947
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,510
about max
at the very end but i'm going to care

1948
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,520
at the very end but i'm going to care
 

1949
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,270
at the very end but i'm going to care
about min along the way

1950
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
about min along the way
 

1951
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,750
about min along the way
and i j is going to specify my substring

1952
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:25,760
and i j is going to specify my substring
 

1953
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,630
and i j is going to specify my substring
so this is going to be the opt value

1954
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:30,640
so this is going to be the opt value
 

1955
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,470
so this is going to be the opt value
opt stands for optimum here or

like this okay so i'm going to get the
 

1983
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,670

1998
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,520
problems
 

1999
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:48,829
problems
let's write down a recurrence relation

2000
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:48,839

 

2001
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,349

okay

2002
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:55,359

 

2003
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,630

so i want to write x of i j

2004
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:58,640
so i want to write x of i j
 

2005
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,910
so i want to write x of i j
off on the left

2006
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:01,920

 

2007
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,349

and i want to optimize so this will be

2008
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
and i want to optimize so this will be
 

2009
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,630
and i want to optimize so this will be
min or max

2010
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,640
min or max
 

2011
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,470
min or max
on a set of choices what is my set of

2012
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,480
on a set of choices what is my set of
 

2013
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,990
on a set of choices what is my set of
choices

2014
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000

2015
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,710
choices
well uh like i said i want to guess what

2016
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:14,720
well uh like i said i want to guess what
 

2017
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,670
well uh like i said i want to guess what
is the last

2018
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:15,680
is the last
 

2019
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,390
is the last
operation evaluated i wrote star i here

2020
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:18,400
operation evaluated i wrote star i here
 

2021
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,109
operation evaluated i wrote star i here
but star i

2022
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:19,119
but star i
 

2023
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,470
but star i
is already defined so i'm going to use

2024
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,480
is already defined so i'm going to use
 

2025
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,790
is already defined so i'm going to use
star k so i'm going to

2026
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
star k so i'm going to
 

2027
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,990
star k so i'm going to
guess what which of my operations

2028
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
guess what which of my operations
 

2029
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,470
guess what which of my operations
between

2030
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:26,480
between
 

2031
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,430
between
i plus 1 and j minus 1 is the last one

2032
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
i plus 1 and j minus 1 is the last one
 

2033
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,950
i plus 1 and j minus 1 is the last one
and i evaluate

2034
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
and i evaluate
 

2035
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,430
and i evaluate
and that decomposes into everything left

2036
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:33,440
and that decomposes into everything left
 

2037
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,630
and that decomposes into everything left
of k

2038
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:34,640
of k
 

2039
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,750
of k
so that would be x of i

2040
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760
so that would be x of i
 

2041
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,630
so that would be x of i
uh comma k comma something

2042
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:42,640
uh comma k comma something
 

2043
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,710
uh comma k comma something
and then we will do operator star k

2044
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:46,720
and then we will do operator star k
 

2045
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,390
and then we will do operator star k
on the part after k which is from k

2046
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
on the part after k which is from k
 

2047
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,670
on the part after k which is from k
to j something

2048
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:53,680
to j something
 

2049
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,670
to j something
okay and i'm choosing between

2050
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,680
okay and i'm choosing between
 

2051
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,870
okay and i'm choosing between
i think it's i less than k less than j

2052
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:00,880
i think it's i less than k less than j
 

2053
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,349
i think it's i less than k less than j
so k is some operator in between because

2054
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:03,359
so k is some operator in between because
 

2055
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,790
so k is some operator in between because
i started i plus 1

2056
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:04,800
i started i plus 1
 

2057
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,630
i started i plus 1
and i end at j minus 1 so those are the

2058
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
and i end at j minus 1 so those are the
 

2059
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,069
and i end at j minus 1 so those are the
possible choices for

2060
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:08,079
possible choices for
 

2061
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,349
possible choices for
k i tried them all that's my local brute

2062
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:11,359
k i tried them all that's my local brute
 

2063
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,870
k i tried them all that's my local brute

2065
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,230
force
and then i take what i can get on the

2066
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
and then i take what i can get on the
 

2067
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,150
and then i take what i can get on the
left what i can get on the right

2068
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160

00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
and multiply or add them according to
 

2071
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,910
and multiply or add them according to
whether that operator is

and i'll just add this to my for loop

2092
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:44,079
and i'll just add this to my for loop
 

2093
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,430
and i'll just add this to my for loop
let's just try uh opt l

2094
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
let's just try uh opt l
 

2095
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,790
let's just try uh opt l
and opt r just take all possible choices

2096
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:50,800
and opt r just take all possible choices
 

2097
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,510

2099
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,950

you know you could think hard and for

2100
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960
you know you could think hard and for
 

2101
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,630
you know you could think hard and for
addition for example

00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,400
if you're maximizing you should really
 

2105
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,150
if you're maximizing you should really
only need to maximize the two parts and

2106
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,160
only need to maximize the two parts and
 

2107
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,430
only need to maximize the two parts and
if you're minimizing you

2108
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
if you're minimizing you
 

2109
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,270
if you're minimizing you
you can prove you only need to minimize

2110
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
you can prove you only need to minimize
 

2111
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,550
you can prove you only need to minimize
the two parts

2112
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,560
the two parts
 

2113
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,270
the two parts
but let's for multiplication it's messy

2114
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:09,280
but let's for multiplication it's messy
 

2115
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,069
but let's for multiplication it's messy
it could be

2116
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:10,079
it could be
 

2117
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,470
it could be
really any of the options because

2118
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
really any of the options because
 

2119

really any of the options because
sometimes

2120
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,280
sometimes
 

2121
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,550
sometimes
when you minimize you get a negative

2122
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
when you minimize you get a negative
 

2123
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,710
when you minimize you get a negative
term sometimes when you

2124
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:16,720
term sometimes when you
 

2125
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,790
term sometimes when you
sometimes you don't and so you know it

2126
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:18,800
sometimes you don't and so you know it
 

2127
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,870
sometimes you don't and so you know it
depends what you're trying to do

2128
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:20,880
depends what you're trying to do
 

2129
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,270
depends what you're trying to do
you have to consider all the signs but

2130
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
you have to consider all the signs but
 

2131
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,630
you have to consider all the signs but
we don't need to think hard

2132
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:24,640
we don't need to think hard
 

2133
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,550
we don't need to think hard
we can just try all options there's only

2134
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
we can just try all options there's only
 

2135
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,270
we can just try all options there's only
four choices for opt l and opt r among

2136
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,280
four choices for opt l and opt r among
 

2137
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,030
four choices for opt l and opt r among
min and max you could do mid min min max

2138
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
min and max you could do mid min min max
 

2139
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,870
min and max you could do mid min min max
max min and max max

2140
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
max min and max max
 

2141
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,190
max min and max max
so try it's just a multiplication by

2142
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,200
so try it's just a multiplication by
 

2143
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,870
so try it's just a multiplication by
four in this for loop

2144
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
four in this for loop
 

2145
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,390
four in this for loop
the big cost is actually this one

2146
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
the big cost is actually this one
 

2147
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,910
the big cost is actually this one
because there are j

2148
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:39,920
because there are j
 

2149
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,270
because there are j
minus i choices for k

2150
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
minus i choices for k
 

2151
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,790
minus i choices for k
there's a constant number of choices for

2152
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:44,800
there's a constant number of choices for
 

2153
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,470
there's a constant number of choices for
opt l and opt r

2154
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
opt l and opt r
 

2155
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,829
opt l and opt r
and you need to prove that this is

2156
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:47,839
and you need to prove that this is
 

2157
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,309
and you need to prove that this is
correct i won't do it here

2158
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:50,319
correct i won't do it here
 

2159
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,390
correct i won't do it here
but the idea is if you're trying to

2160
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:52,400
but the idea is if you're trying to
 

2161
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,550
but the idea is if you're trying to
minimize or maximize your

2162
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,560
minimize or maximize your
 

2163
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,150
minimize or maximize your
sum or product it's enough to know

2164
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
sum or product it's enough to know
 

2165
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,069
sum or product it's enough to know
what ranges these could come in the

2166
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:00,079
what ranges these could come in the
 

2167
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,670
what ranges these could come in the
optimal choice will always be an extreme

2168
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
optimal choice will always be an extreme
 

2169
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,270
optimal choice will always be an extreme
in that range

2170
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,280
in that range
 

2171
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,790
in that range
okay and that's we consider all of them

2172
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:04,800
okay and that's we consider all of them
 

2173
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,390
okay and that's we consider all of them
here and so we get

2174
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
here and so we get
 

2175
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,670
here and so we get
this recurrence now it needs a base case

2176
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680
this recurrence now it needs a base case
 

2177
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,470
this recurrence now it needs a base case
and we need to check that it's acyclic

2178
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,480
and we need to check that it's acyclic
 

2179
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,630
and we need to check that it's acyclic
but topological order is just increasing

2180
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
but topological order is just increasing
 

2181
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,550
but topological order is just increasing
j minus i this is the usual order for

2182
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
j minus i this is the usual order for
 

2183
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,670
j minus i this is the usual order for
um for substring problems because this

2184
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
um for substring problems because this
 

2185
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,510
um for substring problems because this
is increasing length of the substring

2186
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,520
is increasing length of the substring
 

2187
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,589
is increasing length of the substring
so start with very tiny substrings here

2188
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
so start with very tiny substrings here
 

2189
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,190
so start with very tiny substrings here
we'll start with length one substrings

2190
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,200
we'll start with length one substrings
 

2191
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,790
we'll start with length one substrings
we just have an ai there

2192
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:32,800
we just have an ai there
 

2193
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,790
we just have an ai there
so that's going to be our base case and

2194
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
so that's going to be our base case and
 

2195
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,430
so that's going to be our base case and
you grow up to the entire string

2196
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
you grow up to the entire string
 

2197
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,790
you grow up to the entire string
and it doesn't matter how we order

2198
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:38,800
and it doesn't matter how we order
 

2199
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,309
and it doesn't matter how we order
relative to opt as long as we are

2200
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:40,319
relative to opt as long as we are
 

2201
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,589
relative to opt as long as we are
increasing in j minus i

2202
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:41,599
increasing in j minus i
 

2203
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,630
increasing in j minus i
because i decay and k to j will always

2204
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
because i decay and k to j will always
 

2205
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,630
because i decay and k to j will always
be strictly smaller than i to j and so

2206
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
be strictly smaller than i to j and so
 

2207
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,349
be strictly smaller than i to j and so
this will be

2208
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,359
this will be
 

2209
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,470
this will be
acyclic the base case is

2210
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:50,480
acyclic the base case is
 

2211
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,109
acyclic the base case is
x of i i plus 1 opt

2212
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
x of i i plus 1 opt
 

2213
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,589
x of i i plus 1 opt
this is always a i doesn't matter what

2214
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:57,599
this is always a i doesn't matter what
 

2215
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,870
this is always a i doesn't matter what
opt is because there's nothing there's

2216
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
opt is because there's nothing there's
 

2217
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,829
opt is because there's nothing there's
no choice

2218
00:41:59,829 --> 00:41:59,839
no choice
 

2219
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,910
no choice
you just have a single number in that

2220
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:01,920
you just have a single number in that
 

2221
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,430
you just have a single number in that
substring because we're exclusive on i

2222
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
substring because we're exclusive on i
 

2223
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,829
substring because we're exclusive on i
plus 1.

2224
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:05,839
plus 1.
 

2225
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,670
plus 1.
okay and then the original problem we

2226
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:07,680
okay and then the original problem we
 

2227
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,950
okay and then the original problem we
want to solve

2228
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
want to solve
 

2229
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,390
want to solve
is x of 0 n

2230
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,400
is x of 0 n
 

2231
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,510
is x of 0 n
max could also solve min and see how

2232
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
max could also solve min and see how
 

2233
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,470
max could also solve min and see how
small you can get it

2234
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:16,480
small you can get it
 

2235
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,750
small you can get it
so if you wanted to maximize the

2236
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:17,760
so if you wanted to maximize the
 

2237
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,750
so if you wanted to maximize the
absolute value you could solve the max

2238
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
absolute value you could solve the max
 

2239
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,349
absolute value you could solve the max
problem and the min problem and take the

2240
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
problem and the min problem and take the
 

2241
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,150
problem and the min problem and take the
largest

2242
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
largest
 

2243
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,750
largest
of those two options and how much time

2244
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:25,760
of those two options and how much time
 

2245
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,589
of those two options and how much time
does this take

2246
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:27,599
does this take
 

2247
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,829
does this take
well how many sub problems are there for

2248
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:29,839
well how many sub problems are there for
 

2249
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,510
well how many sub problems are there for
substring problems we have n squared sub

2250
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520
substring problems we have n squared sub
 

2251
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,950
substring problems we have n squared sub
problems now we multiplied the number of

2252
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
problems now we multiplied the number of
 

2253
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,550
problems now we multiplied the number of
subproblems by 2

2254
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:34,560
subproblems by 2
 

2255
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,550
subproblems by 2
but that's still n squared okay so we

2256
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:36,560
but that's still n squared okay so we
 

2257
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,589
but that's still n squared okay so we
have n

2258
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:37,599
have n
 

2259
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,630
have n
squared sub problems

2260
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:42,640

 

2261
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,470

and how much work per subproblem are we

2262
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,480
and how much work per subproblem are we
 

2263
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,750
and how much work per subproblem are we
doing well

2264
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:45,760
doing well
 

2265
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,309
doing well
uh as i mentioned we're we're doing j

2266
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
uh as i mentioned we're we're doing j
 

2267
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,670
uh as i mentioned we're we're doing j
minus i choices for k

2268
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,680
minus i choices for k
 

2269
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,190
minus i choices for k
constant number of choices for opt l and

2270
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,200
constant number of choices for opt l and
 

2271
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,990
constant number of choices for opt l and
opt r so this is theta j minus i

2272
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,000
opt r so this is theta j minus i
 

2273
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,750
opt r so this is theta j minus i
which if i'll be sloppy that's at most

2274
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
which if i'll be sloppy that's at most
 

2275
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,990
which if i'll be sloppy that's at most
big o of n

2276
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,000
big o of n
 

2277
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,589
big o of n
and it turns out to be the right answer

2278
00:42:59,589 --> 00:42:59,599
and it turns out to be the right answer
 

2279
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,190
and it turns out to be the right answer
anyway so

2280
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
anyway so
 

2281
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,589
anyway so
uh there's linear amount of

2282
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
uh there's linear amount of
 

2283
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,190
uh there's linear amount of
non-recursive work

2284
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
non-recursive work
 

2285
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,790
non-recursive work
in fact it's like a triangular number

2286
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,800
in fact it's like a triangular number
 

2287
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,510
in fact it's like a triangular number
but uh that's still theta

2288
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:09,520
but uh that's still theta
 

2289
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,950
but uh that's still theta
uh n cubed

2290
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:14,960

 

2291
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,230

okay same running time as uh v cubed we

2292
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
okay same running time as uh v cubed we
 

2293
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,190
okay same running time as uh v cubed we
just got but

2294
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
just got but
 

2295
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,510
just got but
polynomial time and this is pretty

2296
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:21,520
polynomial time and this is pretty
 

2297
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,030

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:50,710
problem because sometimes you want to
take

2326
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
take
 

2327
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,589
take
two very small negative numbers and

2328
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:53,599
two very small negative numbers and
 

2329
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,510
two very small negative numbers and
product them together to get a larger

2330
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:55,520
product them together to get a larger
 

2331
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,109

2333
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,230

cool question

2334
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
cool question
 

2335
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,710
cool question
would anything go wrong if i added minus

2336
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
would anything go wrong if i added minus
 

2337
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,230
would anything go wrong if i added minus
a divide

2338
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,240
a divide
 

2339
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,550
a divide
so what if i had operators minus and

2340
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
so what if i had operators minus and
 

2341
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,069
so what if i had operators minus and
divide

2342
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,079
divide
 

2343
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,710
divide
uh it's a good question i'm i'm certain

2344
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:12,720
uh it's a good question i'm i'm certain
 

2345
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,349
uh it's a good question i'm i'm certain
that

2346
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
that
 

2347
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,390
that
minus should work fine if we do min and

2348
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:16,400
minus should work fine if we do min and
 

2349
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,950
minus should work fine if we do min and
max this will still evaluate the

2350
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
max this will still evaluate the
 

2351
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,550
max this will still evaluate the
should still evaluate the largest thing

2352
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
should still evaluate the largest thing
 

2353
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,790
should still evaluate the largest thing
for division i need to think about the

2354
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
for division i need to think about the
 

2355
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,589
for division i need to think about the
cases

2356
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
cases
 

2357
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,630
cases
i would guess it works but what we need

2358
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
i would guess it works but what we need
 

2359
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,190
i would guess it works but what we need
to prove

2360
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
to prove
 

2361
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,870
to prove
is that the way to maximize or minimize

2362
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:30,880
is that the way to maximize or minimize
 

2363
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,790
is that the way to maximize or minimize
a division say given two numbers in the

2364
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:34,800
a division say given two numbers in the
 

2365
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,790
a division say given two numbers in the
left and right uh is

2366
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:36,800
left and right uh is
 

2367
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,630
left and right uh is
that it either corresponds to maximizing

2368
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
that it either corresponds to maximizing
 

2369
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,790
that it either corresponds to maximizing
or minimizing the thing on the left

2370
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
or minimizing the thing on the left
 

2371
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,550
or minimizing the thing on the left
and then maximize or minimizing the

00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
and then maximize or minimizing the
 

2373
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,069
and then maximize or minimizing the
thing on the right so as long as you

00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
it's not exactly monotonicity it's just
 

2379
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,630
it's not exactly monotonicity it's just
that in order to compute max or min

2380
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
that in order to compute max or min
 

2381
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,910
that in order to compute max or min
it suffices to know the maximum

2382
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:51,920
it suffices to know the maximum
 

2383
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,550
it suffices to know the maximum
of the two parts it's like interval

2384
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:54,560
of the two parts it's like interval
 

2385
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,470
of the two parts it's like interval
arithmetic you know interval arithmetic

2386
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:56,480

that a number is in some interval here

2394
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:03,200
that a number is in some interval here
 

2395
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,309
that a number is in some interval here
and some interval here

2396
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
and some interval here
 

2397
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,390
and some interval here
if the answer is always use one of the

2398
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,400
if the answer is always use one of the
 

2399
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,829
if the answer is always use one of the
extreme endpoints here and use one of

2400
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:07,839
extreme endpoints here and use one of
 

2401
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,349
extreme endpoints here and use one of
the extreme endpoints here then this

2402
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
the extreme endpoints here then this
 

2403
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,030
the extreme endpoints here then this
algorithm will work otherwise

2404
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,040
algorithm will work otherwise
 

2405
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,710
algorithm will work otherwise
all bets are off cool

2406
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:14,720
all bets are off cool
 

2407
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,190
all bets are off cool
so if you negate if you put a minus here

2408
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,200
so if you negate if you put a minus here
 

2409
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,470
so if you negate if you put a minus here
that will work fine because it's just

2410
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
that will work fine because it's just
 

2411
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,069
that will work fine because it's just
negating this range and then it's

2412
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:20,079
negating this range and then it's
 

2413
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,190
negating this range and then it's
just like sum but

2414
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,200
just like sum but
 

2415
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,510
just like sum but
oh divided be careful about zero yeah

2416
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:25,520
oh divided be careful about zero yeah
 

2417
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,670
oh divided be careful about zero yeah
actually so it doesn't work because

2418
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
actually so it doesn't work because
 

2419
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,589
actually so it doesn't work because
we care about how close this can get to

2420
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
we care about how close this can get to
 

2421
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,670
we care about how close this can get to
zero for division

2422
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
zero for division
 

2423
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,030
zero for division
it might be enough to to consider those

2424
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
it might be enough to to consider those
 

2425
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,349
it might be enough to to consider those
it's like instead of minimizing

00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
it's like instead of minimizing
 

2427
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,950
it's like instead of minimizing
and instead of computing this entire

2428
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
and instead of computing this entire
 

2429
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,190
and instead of computing this entire
interval if this interval spans 0

2430
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
interval if this interval spans 0

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:49,910
i need to know how close to zero i can
get on the left side and how close to

2436
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:49,920
get on the left side and how close to
 

2437
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,190
get on the left side and how close to
zero i can get on the right side still

2438
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,200
zero i can get on the right side still
 

2439
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,270

i would guess for division that's enough

2442
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:54,880
i would guess for division that's enough

00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
very bad infinite time okay
 

2493
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:53,670
very bad infinite time okay
our last example is piano fingering

2494
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,680

 

2495
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,109

so here we're given

2496
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
so here we're given
 

2497
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,950
so here we're given
a sequence of notes

2498
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960

 

2499
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,190

t zero t one t for note

2500
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,200
t zero t one t for note
 

2501
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,190
t zero t one t for note
up to n t n minus one um

2502
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
up to n t n minus one um
 

2503
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,430
up to n t n minus one um
these are single notes

2504
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:15,440

 

2505
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,470

and all the single notes all the single

2506
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:18,480
and all the single notes all the single
 

2507
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:18,870
and all the single notes all the single
notes

2508
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
notes
 

2509
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,829
notes
right and we have fingers on our

2510
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:22,839
right and we have fingers on our
 

2511
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,270
right and we have fingers on our
hands this is not like two-finger

2512
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
hands this is not like two-finger
 

2513
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,470
hands this is not like two-finger
algorithm this is the

2514
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
algorithm this is the
 

2515
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,589
algorithm this is the
five-finger algorithm uh

2516
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:29,599
five-finger algorithm uh
 

2517
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,510
five-finger algorithm uh
so in general i'm going to assume an

2518
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:31,520
so in general i'm going to assume an
 

2519
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,790
so in general i'm going to assume an
arbitrary

2520
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:32,800
arbitrary
 

2521
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,829
arbitrary
uh anthropomorphic

2522
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:36,839
uh anthropomorphic
 

2523
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,230
uh anthropomorphic
object so this is five for humans

2524
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240
object so this is five for humans
 

2525
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,150
object so this is five for humans
most humans some humans i think the

2526
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,160
most humans some humans i think the
 

2527
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,309
most humans some humans i think the
maximum on each hand

2528
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
maximum on each hand
 

2529
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,710
maximum on each hand
is seven could be smaller maybe you've

2530
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
is seven could be smaller maybe you've
 

2531
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,750
is seven could be smaller maybe you've
had an accident

2532
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
had an accident
 

2533
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,430
had an accident
okay i'll solve it for arbitrary f

2534
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440
okay i'll solve it for arbitrary f
 

2535
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,190
okay i'll solve it for arbitrary f
and what we'd like to do is assign

2536
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:53,200
and what we'd like to do is assign
 

2537
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,589
and what we'd like to do is assign
fingers to notes

2538
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:55,599
fingers to notes
 

2539
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,950
fingers to notes
to tell our pianist which finger to use

2540
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:58,960
to tell our pianist which finger to use
 

2541
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,750
to tell our pianist which finger to use
for each note

2542
00:47:59,750 --> 00:47:59,760
for each note
 

2543
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,030
for each note
so normally when you're given sheet

2544
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,040
so normally when you're given sheet
 

2545
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,870
so normally when you're given sheet
music it just gives you

2546
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
music it just gives you
 

2547
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,150
music it just gives you
a sequence of notes you want to play it

2548
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
a sequence of notes you want to play it
 

2549
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,510
a sequence of notes you want to play it
doesn't tell you which finger you want

2550
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:05,520
doesn't tell you which finger you want
 

2551
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,790
doesn't tell you which finger you want
to play it with

2552
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:06,800
to play it with
 

2553
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,309
to play it with
unless you have some nice uh training

2554
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:10,319
unless you have some nice uh training
 

2555
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,069
unless you have some nice uh training
booklets and they have a little number

2556
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:12,079
booklets and they have a little number
 

2557
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,069
booklets and they have a little number
on top of each and then you number them

2558
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:14,079
on top of each and then you number them
 

2559
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,470
on top of each and then you number them
one two three four five and

2560
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,480
one two three four five and
 

2561
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,990
one two three four five and
symmetrically one two three four

2562
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,000
symmetrically one two three four
 

2563
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,589
symmetrically one two three four
five and so here's a giant piano

2564
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
five and so here's a giant piano
 

2565
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,950
five and so here's a giant piano
for my giant hands um so uh

2566
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
for my giant hands um so uh
 

2567
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,470
for my giant hands um so uh
if jason were here he could sing these

2568
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,480
if jason were here he could sing these
 

2569
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,470
if jason were here he could sing these
notes so maybe i play this

2570
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,480
notes so maybe i play this
 

2571
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,069
notes so maybe i play this
with my first finger this with my second

2572
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
with my first finger this with my second
 

2573
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,990
with my first finger this with my second
finger let's just say i'm doing a scale

2574
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
finger let's just say i'm doing a scale
 

2575
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,150
finger let's just say i'm doing a scale
so i can walk and now i think typical

2576
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,160
so i can walk and now i think typical
 

2577
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,589
so i can walk and now i think typical
way to do a scale is to reach over with

2578
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
way to do a scale is to reach over with
 

2579
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,150
way to do a scale is to reach over with
your

2580
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,160
your
 

2581
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,309
your
first finger second finger i guess and

2582
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:38,319
first finger second finger i guess and
 

2583
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,910
first finger second finger i guess and
then do something like this

2584
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:39,920
then do something like this
 

2585
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,510
then do something like this
no okay clearly i don't know scales

2586
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:43,520
no okay clearly i don't know scales
 

2587
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,750
no okay clearly i don't know scales
um or how to play a piano but you know

2588
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:45,760
um or how to play a piano but you know
 

2589
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,829
um or how to play a piano but you know
there's there's limits here i can

2590
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:47,839
there's there's limits here i can
 

2591
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,510
there's there's limits here i can
if i'm going from this note and i want

2592
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
if i'm going from this note and i want
 

2593
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,430
if i'm going from this note and i want
to go to another note

2594
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,440
to go to another note
 

2595
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,829
to go to another note
uh over here okay maybe i have a decent

2596
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:53,839
uh over here okay maybe i have a decent
 

2597
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:54,549
uh over here okay maybe i have a decent
span

2598
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
span
 

2599
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,870
span
from first finger to fifth finger but my

2600
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
from first finger to fifth finger but my
 

2601
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,390
from first finger to fifth finger but my
span from my first finger to my second

2602
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,400
span from my first finger to my second
 

2603
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,190
span from my first finger to my second
finger is

2604
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,200
finger is
 

2605
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,589
finger is
not as big i can't reach as far so if i

2606
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:01,599
not as big i can't reach as far so if i
 

2607
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,710
not as big i can't reach as far so if i
want to play this note and then this

2608
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:02,720
want to play this note and then this
 

2609
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,670
want to play this note and then this
note i'd like to

2610
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:03,680
note i'd like to
 

2611
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,470
note i'd like to
start here with a very extreme finger on

2612
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
start here with a very extreme finger on
 

2613
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,190
start here with a very extreme finger on
the left

2614
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
the left
 

2615
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,950
the left
and then go to a very extreme finger on

2616
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:08,960
and then go to a very extreme finger on
 

2617
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,549
and then go to a very extreme finger on
the right so

2618
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:10,559
the right so
 

2619
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,030
the right so
i'm going to formalize this problem

2620
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,040
i'm going to formalize this problem
 

2621
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,470
i'm going to formalize this problem
pretty abstractly because i don't want

2622
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:14,480
pretty abstractly because i don't want
 

2623
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,990
pretty abstractly because i don't want
to get into

2624
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,000
to get into
 

2625
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,109
to get into
music performance i'm going to say that

2626
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:19,119
music performance i'm going to say that
 

2627
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,670
music performance i'm going to say that
there's a metric

2628
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
there's a metric
 

2629
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,870
there's a metric
d for if i'm at note t

2630
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:24,880
d for if i'm at note t
 

2631
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,670
d for if i'm at note t
with finger f and i want to go to note t

2632
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,680
with finger f and i want to go to note t
 

2633
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,829
with finger f and i want to go to note t
prime with finger f

2634
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:28,839
prime with finger f
 

2635
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,710
prime with finger f
prime then this function

2636
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
prime then this function
 

2637
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,589
prime then this function
d of t f t prime f prime gives me the

00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:35,599
d of t f t prime f prime gives me the
 

2639
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:42,390
d of t f t prime f prime gives me the
difficulty of doing that

2640

it's w is width uh so this is a

2650
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
it's w is width uh so this is a
 

2651
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,270
it's w is width uh so this is a
transition difficulty

transition difficulty
i'm not going to worry about difficulty

2654
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:05,280
i'm not going to worry about difficulty
 

2655
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,109
i'm not going to worry about difficulty
of the whole piece other than saying

2656
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:07,119
of the whole piece other than saying
 

2657
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,470
of the whole piece other than saying
i've got to play this note then i've got

2658
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:08,480
i've got to play this note then i've got
 

2659
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,750
i've got to play this note then i've got
to play this note and for now just

2660
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:09,760
to play this note and for now just
 

2661
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,790
to play this note and for now just
single notes

2662
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800
single notes
 

2663
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,150
single notes
you play a single note with your right

2664
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,160
you play a single note with your right
 

2665
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,750
you play a single note with your right
hand then you play another single note

2666
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:13,760
hand then you play another single note
 

2667
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,870
hand then you play another single note
with your right hand then another single

2668
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
with your right hand then another single
 

2669
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,910
with your right hand then another single
note with your right hand

2670
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:15,920
note with your right hand
 

2671
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,589
note with your right hand
let's assume no pauses for now no rests

2672
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
let's assume no pauses for now no rests
 

2673
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,870
let's assume no pauses for now no rests
and great so we uh

2674
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880
and great so we uh
 

2675
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,870
and great so we uh
have this difficulty from going from the

2676
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:24,880
have this difficulty from going from the
 

2677
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,990
have this difficulty from going from the
ith note to the i

2678
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,000
ith note to the i
 

2679
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,190
ith note to the i
plus first note and then our goal is to

2680
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
plus first note and then our goal is to
 

2681
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,390
plus first note and then our goal is to
minimize the sum of difficulties

2682
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,400
minimize the sum of difficulties
 

2683
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,589
minimize the sum of difficulties
minimum sum of

2684
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:35,599

00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:54,000
which notes to play okay so this is
 

2697
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,109
which notes to play okay so this is
actually a natural problem there are

actually a natural problem there are
 

2699
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,470
actually a natural problem there are
lots of papers about this problem i've

2700
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
lots of papers about this problem i've
 

2701
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,510
lots of papers about this problem i've
read a bunch of them

obviously not super well about how to

2704
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
obviously not super well about how to
 

2705
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,870
obviously not super well about how to
compute how to play scales

compute how to play scales
 

2707
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,910

if i play a note far on the left

2722
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:17,440
if i play a note far on the left
 

2723
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,990
if i play a note far on the left
on the left so if i go from a low note

00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
that's easier to do if i use a lower
 

2729

that's easier to do if i use a lower
numbered finger and go to a higher

numbered finger and go to a higher
 

2731
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,549

to play a note on the right that's

2742
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:37,119
to play a note on the right that's
 

2743
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,870
to play a note on the right that's
annoying so i'd like to do an assignment

2744
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:38,880
annoying so i'd like to do an assignment
 

2745
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,390
annoying so i'd like to do an assignment
if i can that avoids that so i'll just

2746
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:40,400
if i can that avoids that so i'll just
 

2747
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,150
if i can that avoids that so i'll just
have some penalty of like 100

2748
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,160
have some penalty of like 100
 

2749
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,829
have some penalty of like 100
if that happens and zero if it doesn't

2750
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
if that happens and zero if it doesn't
 

2751
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,470
if that happens and zero if it doesn't
happen sum up a bunch of terms like that

2752
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:46,480
happen sum up a bunch of terms like that
 

2753
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,950
happen sum up a bunch of terms like that
other examples are avoid the fourth and

or if i'm playing a portion of the song

2758
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:53,599
or if i'm playing a portion of the song
 

2759
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,470
or if i'm playing a portion of the song
that is

2760
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:54,480
that is
 

2761
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,030
that is
legato then i don't want to use the same

2762
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
legato then i don't want to use the same
 

2763
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,910
legato then i don't want to use the same
finger to play

2764
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:57,920
finger to play
 

2765
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,549
finger to play
two notes uh right after the other i've

2766
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:00,559
two notes uh right after the other i've
 

2767
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,390
two notes uh right after the other i've
gotta use two different fingers for that

2768
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,400
gotta use two different fingers for that
 

2769
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,790
gotta use two different fingers for that
so you have a penalty if f i equals f i

2770
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
so you have a penalty if f i equals f i
 

2771
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,589
so you have a penalty if f i equals f i
plus one

2772
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:05,599
plus one
 

2773
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,990
plus one
and these two notes are not the same uh

2774
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:08,000
and these two notes are not the same uh
 

2775
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,349
and these two notes are not the same uh
then

2776
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
then
 

2777
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,270
then
and we're in legato mode then we add a

2778
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
and we're in legato mode then we add a
 

2779
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,470
and we're in legato mode then we add a
penalty term

2780
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
penalty term
 

2781
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,270
penalty term
and things like that i would prefer if

2782
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:15,280
and things like that i would prefer if
 

2783
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,349
and things like that i would prefer if
i'm going from a very low note to a very

2784
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
i'm going from a very low note to a very
 

2785
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:17,990
i'm going from a very low note to a very
high note

2786
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:18,000
high note
 

2787
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,829
high note
i'd like to use more extreme fingers

2788
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
i'd like to use more extreme fingers
 

2789
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,349
i'd like to use more extreme fingers
things like that

2790
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:21,359
things like that
 

2791
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,710
things like that
okay but we're just going to assume this

2792
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
okay but we're just going to assume this
 

2793
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,349
okay but we're just going to assume this
di d function is given to us

2794
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:25,359
di d function is given to us
 

2795
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,430
di d function is given to us
it's some you know const was

2796
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:29,440
it's some you know const was
 

2797
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,349
it's some you know const was
some polynomial size if you imagine the

2798
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:31,359
some polynomial size if you imagine the
 

2799
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,950
some polynomial size if you imagine the
notes on your keyboard

2800
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:32,960
notes on your keyboard
 

2801
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,829
notes on your keyboard
are n notes or m notes then some

2802
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:35,839
are n notes or m notes then some
 

2803
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,109
are n notes or m notes then some
polynomial and m

2804
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
polynomial and m
 

2805
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,309
polynomial and m
size to this function okay

2806
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,319

 

2807
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:46,069

so how do we solve this problem

2808
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:46,079
so how do we solve this problem
 

2809
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,230
so how do we solve this problem
i'm running low on time so let me

2810
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:50,240

 

2811
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:56,790

give you

2812
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:56,800

 

2813
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,270

the idea

2814
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,280
the idea
 

2815
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,630
the idea
and this is going to use sub-problem

2816
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:02,640
and this is going to use sub-problem
 

2817
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,870
and this is going to use sub-problem
expansion

2818
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:06,880

 

2819
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,990

so the sub-problems are going to be

2820
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,000
so the sub-problems are going to be
 

2821
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,470
so the sub-problems are going to be
x of i comma f this is the minimum

2822
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:14,480
x of i comma f this is the minimum
 

2823
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,390
x of i comma f this is the minimum
total difficulty

2824
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:18,400

 

2825
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,030

to play a suffix because i like suffixes

2826
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
to play a suffix because i like suffixes
 

2827
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,510
to play a suffix because i like suffixes

2829
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,710

uh starting

2830
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:32,720

 

2831
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,870

with finger f

2832
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:38,880

 

2833
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,630

uh on note ti

2834
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
uh on note ti
 

2835
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,790
uh on note ti
okay so the obvious sub problems would

2836
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:44,800
okay so the obvious sub problems would
 

2837
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,990
okay so the obvious sub problems would
be without this

2838
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,000
be without this
 

2839
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,150
be without this
constraint this here is a sub problem

2840
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,160
constraint this here is a sub problem
 

2841
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,309
constraint this here is a sub problem
constraint

2842
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
constraint
 

2843
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,829
constraint
and you could try to define the sub

2844
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
and you could try to define the sub
 

2845
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,670
and you could try to define the sub
problems just as what's the best way to

2846
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:53,680
problems just as what's the best way to
 

2847
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,950
problems just as what's the best way to
play a suffix

2848
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
play a suffix
 

2849
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,630
play a suffix
but i claim it's important to know which

2850
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:56,640
but i claim it's important to know which
 

2851
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,710
but i claim it's important to know which
finger we start with so we're going to

2852
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:58,720
finger we start with so we're going to
 

2853
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,549
finger we start with so we're going to
multiply the number of sub-problems by

2854
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:00,559
multiply the number of sub-problems by
 

2855
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,470
multiply the number of sub-problems by
capital f which is just five so

2856
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:02,480
capital f which is just five so
 

2857
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,109
capital f which is just five so
very small sub-problem expansion and

2858
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
very small sub-problem expansion and
 

2859
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,150
very small sub-problem expansion and
then we're going to constrain each

2860
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:06,160
then we're going to constrain each
 

2861
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,589
then we're going to constrain each
sub-problem to say well what if i

2862
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:07,599
sub-problem to say well what if i
 

2863
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,790

started with my first finger what if i

2864
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800

00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
started with my second finger what if
 

2867
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,510
started with my second finger what if
up to the fifth finger try them all

2868
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:13,520
up to the fifth finger try them all
 

2869
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,069
up to the fifth finger try them all
okay then i turns out i can write a

2870
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
okay then i turns out i can write a
 

2871
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,390
okay then i turns out i can write a
relation

2872
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:18,400
relation
 

2873
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,150
relation
which is x of i f

2874
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,160
which is x of i f
 

2875
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,030
which is x of i f
equals the min what should i what should

over i'll just uh guess
 

2881
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,710
over i'll just uh guess
this i'm already told what my first

2882
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:30,720
this i'm already told what my first
 

2883
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,230
this i'm already told what my first
finger is

2884
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,240
finger is
 

2885
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,349
finger is
to use which finger i should use for ti

2886
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:35,359
to use which finger i should use for ti
 

2887
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,789
to use which finger i should use for ti
so what's the next thing that matters

2888
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:36,799
so what's the next thing that matters
 

2889
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,630
so what's the next thing that matters
well i guess what finger to use

2890
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
well i guess what finger to use
 

2891
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,950
well i guess what finger to use
for the ti plus one the very next note

2892
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:40,960
for the ti plus one the very next note
 

2893
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,109
for the ti plus one the very next note
which what is the next finger i use

2894
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:43,119
which what is the next finger i use
 

2895
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,789
which what is the next finger i use
i will call that f prime and minimize

2896
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:46,799
i will call that f prime and minimize
 

2897
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,870
i will call that f prime and minimize
over f prime between one and capital f

2898
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
over f prime between one and capital f
 

2899
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,470
over f prime between one and capital f
of the remaining suffix

2900
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,480
of the remaining suffix
 

2901
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,230
of the remaining suffix
starting with f prime plus my difficulty

2902
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
starting with f prime plus my difficulty
 

2903
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,030
starting with f prime plus my difficulty
function

2904
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
function
 

2905
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,630
function
from t i comma f to t i plus 1

2906
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:02,640
from t i comma f to t i plus 1
 

2907
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,109
from t i comma f to t i plus 1
comma f prime end of bracket

2908
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:07,119
comma f prime end of bracket
 

2909
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,630
comma f prime end of bracket
okay so there's kind of a lot going here

2910
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
okay so there's kind of a lot going here
 

2911
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,910
okay so there's kind of a lot going here
this is a

2912
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:11,920
this is a
 

2913
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,510
this is a
lowercase f prime

2914
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:15,520

 

2915
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,030

but actually if you think about what i'd

2916
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,040
but actually if you think about what i'd
 

2917
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,710
but actually if you think about what i'd
like to write the recurrence on

2918
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
like to write the recurrence on
 

2919
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,109
like to write the recurrence on
i start with the suffix i i like to

2920
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,119
i start with the suffix i i like to
 

2921
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,789
i start with the suffix i i like to
recurse on the smaller suffix so that's

2922
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:22,799
recurse on the smaller suffix so that's
 

2923
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,670
recurse on the smaller suffix so that's
x of i plus one

2924
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:25,680
x of i plus one
 

2925
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,030
x of i plus one
and so here uh if if i know that i'm

2926
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,040
and so here uh if if i know that i'm
 

2927
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,030
and so here uh if if i know that i'm
parametrizing by finger number

2928
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,040
parametrizing by finger number
 

2929
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,069
parametrizing by finger number
for i well then i in order to even call

2930
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:34,079
for i well then i in order to even call
 

2931
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,510
for i well then i in order to even call
this function i need to know what finger

2932
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:35,520
this function i need to know what finger
 

2933
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,030
this function i need to know what finger
i'm using for i plus one so once you

2934
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,040
i'm using for i plus one so once you
 

2935
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,390
i'm using for i plus one so once you
decide on these sub problems it's really

2936
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,400
decide on these sub problems it's really
 

2937
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,990
decide on these sub problems it's really
obvious you need to guess

2938
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,000
obvious you need to guess
 

2939
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,030
obvious you need to guess
what is the next finger and then recurse

2940
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
what is the next finger and then recurse
 

2941
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,430
what is the next finger and then recurse
on that finger recurs on the remaining

2942
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:45,440
on that finger recurs on the remaining
 

2943
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,549
on that finger recurs on the remaining
suffix of that finger

2944
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:46,559
suffix of that finger
 

2945
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,109
suffix of that finger
now why did we need to know what f what

2946
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:49,119
now why did we need to know what f what
 

2947
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:49,670
now why did we need to know what f what
these

2948
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
these
 

2949
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,309
these
fingers were why not just guess what the

2950
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
fingers were why not just guess what the
 

2951
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,750
fingers were why not just guess what the
first finger is

2952
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
first finger is
 

2953
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,870
first finger is
uh well it has to do with this

2954
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:54,880
uh well it has to do with this
 

2955
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,109
uh well it has to do with this
difficulty function for this difficulty

2956
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:57,119
difficulty function for this difficulty
 

2957
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,390
difficulty function for this difficulty
function i know that i want to measure

2958
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:58,400
function i know that i want to measure
 

2959
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,349
function i know that i want to measure
the difficulty from t i to t i plus one

2960
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:01,359
the difficulty from t i to t i plus one
 

2961
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,910
the difficulty from t i to t i plus one
and to do that because this function is

2962
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
and to do that because this function is
 

2963
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,670
and to do that because this function is
parametrized by four things i need to

2964
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:05,680
parametrized by four things i need to
 

2965
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,510
parametrized by four things i need to
know both the finger for ti

2966
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:07,520
know both the finger for ti
 

2967
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,750
know both the finger for ti
and at the same time the finger for ti

2968
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:09,760
and at the same time the finger for ti
 

2969
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,549
and at the same time the finger for ti
plus one

2970
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:10,559
plus one
 

2971
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,510
plus one
if i remove this f i could you know add

2972
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:13,520
if i remove this f i could you know add
 

2973
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,190
if i remove this f i could you know add
a min over one finger but i can't really

2974
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
a min over one finger but i can't really
 

2975
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,670
a min over one finger but i can't really
add a

2976
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:15,680
add a
 

2977
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,870
add a
min over two fingers so what this does

2978
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:18,880
min over two fingers so what this does
 

2979
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,270
min over two fingers so what this does
by parameterizing by f here and writing

2980
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:21,280
by parameterizing by f here and writing
 

2981
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,390
by parameterizing by f here and writing
down the optimal

2982
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:22,400
down the optimal
 

2983
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,910
down the optimal
for each starting finger f i can

2984
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
for each starting finger f i can
 

2985
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,030
for each starting finger f i can
at some sense i'm remembering

2986
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
at some sense i'm remembering
 

2987
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,710
at some sense i'm remembering
in this call what finger i started with

2988
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:32,720
in this call what finger i started with
 

2989
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,390
in this call what finger i started with
because i told it you have to start with

2990
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:34,400
because i told it you have to start with
 

2991
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,030
because i told it you have to start with
finger f prime and so locally to

2992
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,040
finger f prime and so locally to
 

2993
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,390
finger f prime and so locally to
x i f um

2994
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,400
x i f um
 

2995
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,470
x i f um
i know what finger f prime is being used

2996
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:42,480
i know what finger f prime is being used
 

2997
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,150
i know what finger f prime is being used
for t i plus pos1 and also

2998
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
for t i plus pos1 and also
 

2999
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,750
for t i plus pos1 and also
because of the definition of x i f i

3000
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
because of the definition of x i f i
 

3001
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,990
because of the definition of x i f i
know what finger i'm using for ti

3002
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,000
know what finger i'm using for ti
 

3003
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,349
know what finger i'm using for ti
and so i get to know both of these

3004
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:49,359
and so i get to know both of these
 

3005
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,150
and so i get to know both of these
fingers one comes out of this min

3006
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,160
fingers one comes out of this min
 

3007
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,829
fingers one comes out of this min
and the other is given to me as this

3008
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:53,839
and the other is given to me as this
 

3009
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,270
and the other is given to me as this
parameter

3010
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:55,280
parameter
 

3011
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,789
parameter
and then of course if i can solve these

3012
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:56,799
and then of course if i can solve these
 

3013
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,789
and then of course if i can solve these
problems i can solve the original

3014
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:58,799
problems i can solve the original
 

3015
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,390
problems i can solve the original
problem

3016
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,400

f right i don't know which finger to

3024
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,000
f right i don't know which finger to
 

3025
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,109
f right i don't know which finger to
start with but that's just

3026
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:13,119
start with but that's just
 

3027
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,829
start with but that's just
f choices and so then this recurrence

3028
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
f choices and so then this recurrence
 

3029
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:16,549
f choices and so then this recurrence
gives me

3030
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
gives me
 

3031
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,069
gives me
the overall solution in i'll just jump

3032
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:20,079
the overall solution in i'll just jump
 

3033
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,069
the overall solution in i'll just jump
to the time you need a base case

3034
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:22,079
to the time you need a base case
 

3035
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,510
to the time you need a base case
and uh topological order but it is

3036
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:25,520
and uh topological order but it is
 

3037
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,109
and uh topological order but it is
n f squared time there are n

3038
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:29,119
n f squared time there are n
 

3039
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,750
n f squared time there are n
times f sub problems here and for each

3040
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
times f sub problems here and for each
 

3041
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,150
times f sub problems here and for each
one

3042
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160

i'm doing an optimization over f choices

3044
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:34,799
i'm doing an optimization over f choices
 

3045
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:35,990
i'm doing an optimization over f choices
so i get n times f

3046
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,000
so i get n times f
 

3047
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,630
so i get n times f
squared it's a polynomial and if f is a

3048
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640
squared it's a polynomial and if f is a
 

3049
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,990
squared it's a polynomial and if f is a
constant this is actually linear

3050
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,000
constant this is actually linear
 

3051
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,030
constant this is actually linear
time very fast dp now what i described

00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,040
time very fast dp now what i described
 

3053
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:43,990

here is for

3054
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:44,000
here is for
 

3055
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,390
here is for
one hand one note at a time but you can

3056
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
one hand one note at a time but you can
 

3057
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,589
one hand one note at a time but you can
generalize this to

3058
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
generalize this to
 

3059
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,510
generalize this to
two hands each with one note well that's

3060
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:49,520
two hands each with one note well that's
 

3061
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,109
two hands each with one note well that's
just ten fingers so

3062
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
just ten fingers so
 

3063
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,630
just ten fingers so
uh you could solve this separately for

3064
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:52,640
uh you could solve this separately for
 

3065
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,990
uh you could solve this separately for
the right hand and left hand if you know

3066
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,000
the right hand and left hand if you know
 

3067
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,430
the right hand and left hand if you know
which notes are being played

3068
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
which notes are being played
 

3069
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,589
which notes are being played
with left-handed right hand but some

3070
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
with left-handed right hand but some
 

3071
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,789
with left-handed right hand but some
pieces that's not obvious

3072
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:00,799
pieces that's not obvious
 

3073
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,630
pieces that's not obvious
so to make it more interesting what if

3074
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:02,640
so to make it more interesting what if
 

3075
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,829
so to make it more interesting what if
you have multiple notes

3076
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:03,839
you have multiple notes
 

3077
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,589
you have multiple notes
at the same time and let's say i think

3078
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:05,599
at the same time and let's say i think
 

3079
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,030
at the same time and let's say i think
it's reasonable so you can only play

3080
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:07,040
it's reasonable so you can only play
 

3081
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,069
it's reasonable so you can only play
up to f notes at a time

3082
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,079
up to f notes at a time
 

3083
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,349
up to f notes at a time
one for each finger and so we have an

3084
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:13,359
one for each finger and so we have an
 

3085
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,710
one for each finger and so we have an
upper bound of the number of notes

3086
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:14,720
upper bound of the number of notes
 

3087
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,109
upper bound of the number of notes
at a time that we're playing which is

3088
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:17,119
at a time that we're playing which is
 

3089
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,630
at a time that we're playing which is
good

3090
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:18,640
good
 

3091
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,349
good
oh i have a drawing of this dp by the

as a subproblem dag so

3096
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:25,440
as a subproblem dag so
 

3097
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,349
as a subproblem dag so
this is the original problem which is we

3098
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:27,359
this is the original problem which is we
 

3099
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,950
this is the original problem which is we
don't know which finger to

00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
don't know which finger to
 

3101
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,349
don't know which finger to
start with but then we just have a

00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
start with but then we just have a
 

3103
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,270

complete bipartite graph here
 

3105
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,109

do i start on and so you could solve

3120
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,319
do i start on and so you could solve
 

3121
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,150
do i start on and so you could solve
this with shortest paths and a dag

3122

this with shortest paths and a dag
 

3123
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,150
this with shortest paths and a dag
or you could just solve it directly this

so if you do multiple notes at a time

3130
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:01,359
so if you do multiple notes at a time
 

3131
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,030
so if you do multiple notes at a time
instead of this finger choice which just

instead of this finger choice which just
had f choices

had f choices
 

3135
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,470

3143
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,309
possible states
where t is the maximum number of notes

3144
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:22,319
where t is the maximum number of notes
 

3145
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:28,069
where t is the maximum number of notes
that i could play at once

3146
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:28,079

 

3147
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,230

and usually this is at most f one for

3148
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:30,240
and usually this is at most f one for
 

3149
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,630
and usually this is at most f one for
finger but we could generalize

3150
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:32,640
finger but we could generalize
 

3151
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,109
finger but we could generalize
and this is you know number of fingers

3152
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119

 

3153
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,750

so i could deal with all 10 fingers of a

3154
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:39,760
so i could deal with all 10 fingers of a

human set of arms hands
 

3159
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,549
human set of arms hands
and say there's at most 10 and so this

3160
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:46,559
and say there's at most 10 and so this
 

3161
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,750
and say there's at most 10 and so this
is 10 to the 10. it's a

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,309
is 10 to the 10. it's a
big constant but it's constant uh like a

the possible things i could do
 

3177
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,349
the possible things i could do
be doing with all of my hands so you can

3178
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
be doing with all of my hands so you can
 

3179
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,270
be doing with all of my hands so you can
apply this not only to

3180
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
apply this not only to
 

3181
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,349
apply this not only to
piano fingering but also to guitar

3182
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:09,359
piano fingering but also to guitar
 

3183
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,670
piano fingering but also to guitar
fingering also to rock band rock band is

3184
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
fingering also to rock band rock band is
 

3185
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,430
fingering also to rock band rock band is
an easy case where you just have five

3186
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
an easy case where you just have five
 

3187
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,750
an easy case where you just have five
buttons and usually only four fingers

3188
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:15,760
buttons and usually only four fingers
 

3189
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,349
buttons and usually only four fingers
that you use

3190
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:17,359
that you use
 

3191
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,710
that you use
and this doesn't really make any sound

3192
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
and this doesn't really make any sound
 

3193
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,549
and this doesn't really make any sound
so it's not that exciting

3194
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:20,559
so it's not that exciting
 

3195
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,589
so it's not that exciting
so the case where f equals four

3196
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
so the case where f equals four
 

3197
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,230
so the case where f equals four
is uh you can apply to optimally figure

3198
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:26,240
is uh you can apply to optimally figure
 

3199
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,870
is uh you can apply to optimally figure
out which

3200
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880
out which
 

3201
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,549
out which
which finger once you have a difficulty

3202
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:28,559
which finger once you have a difficulty
 

3203
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,150
which finger once you have a difficulty

and hard
for rock band then you can optimally

3208
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:34,799
for rock band then you can optimally
 

3209
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,150
for rock band then you can optimally
figure out your fingering for rock band

3210
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:36,160
figure out your fingering for rock band

01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
because there are actually multiple ways
 

3219
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,710
because there are actually multiple ways
to play the same note

3220
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:46,720
to play the same note
 

3221
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,230
to play the same note
for example i can play

3222
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
for example i can play
 

3223
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,829
for example i can play
the note of this string like this

3224
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:53,839
the note of this string like this
 

3225

the note of this string like this
these should both sound the same my

these should both sound the same my
guitar were

3228
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:56,960
guitar were
 

3229
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,470
guitar were
perfectly tuned which is not

3230
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
perfectly tuned which is not
 

3231
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,829
perfectly tuned which is not
and that's you know properties of

3232
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:01,839
and that's you know properties of
 

3233
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,670
and that's you know properties of
strings and the way these things are

3234
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:03,680
strings and the way these things are
 

3235
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,230
strings and the way these things are
are played so in addition to what finger

3236
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:06,240
are played so in addition to what finger
 

3237
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,150
are played so in addition to what finger
i use i should also decide which string

3238
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:08,160
i use i should also decide which string
 

3239
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,150
i use i should also decide which string
to play that note on if all i'm given is

3240
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,160
to play that note on if all i'm given is
 

3241
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,230
to play that note on if all i'm given is
sheet music different notes to play

3242
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
sheet music different notes to play
 

3243
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,470
sheet music different notes to play
another thing i could guess is which

3244
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:14,480
another thing i could guess is which
 

3245
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,630
another thing i could guess is which
string to play that note on

3246
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,640
string to play that note on
 

3247
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,510
string to play that note on
so for example maybe i want to play my

3248
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:19,520
so for example maybe i want to play my
 

3249
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,829
so for example maybe i want to play my
favorite song

3250
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:22,839

 

3251
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,630

here

3252
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:26,640

song um

3256
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:29,839
song um
 

3257
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:31,270
song um
i can keep going but i actually can't

3258
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:31,280
i can keep going but i actually can't
 

3259
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,589
i can keep going but i actually can't
keep going it won't be as impressive

3260
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
keep going it won't be as impressive
 

3261
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,950
keep going it won't be as impressive
uh i don't actually know how to play

3262
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
uh i don't actually know how to play
 

3263
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,870
uh i don't actually know how to play
guitar uh but the

3264
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:36,880
guitar uh but the
 

3265
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,309
guitar uh but the
there are a lot of choices there right

3266
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:38,319
there are a lot of choices there right
 

3267
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,030
there are a lot of choices there right
um i started with uh playing this note

3268
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,040
um i started with uh playing this note
 

3269
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,270
um i started with uh playing this note
down on this um down on this string

3270
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:45,280
down on this um down on this string
 

3271
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,349
down on this um down on this string
that's good i could have also played it

3272
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:47,359
that's good i could have also played it
 

3273
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,109
that's good i could have also played it
on this string

3274
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:49,119
on this string
 

3275
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,950
on this string
but that's more work for my finger so i

3276
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:50,960
but that's more work for my finger so i
 

3277
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,630
but that's more work for my finger so i
have a diff penalty function that says

3278
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:52,640
have a diff penalty function that says
 

3279
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,150
have a diff penalty function that says
well if i play an open string that's a

3280
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
well if i play an open string that's a
 

3281
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,750
well if i play an open string that's a
lot easier

3282
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:55,760
lot easier
 

3283
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,150
lot easier
and then i had a transition from here

3284
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,160
and then i had a transition from here
 

3285
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,349
and then i had a transition from here
this note

3286
01:01:59,349 --> 01:01:59,359
this note
 

3287
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,510
this note
to this note to this note and if you

3288
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
to this note to this note and if you
 

3289
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,230
to this note to this note and if you
focus on my fingering here i chose to

3290
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
focus on my fingering here i chose to
 

3291
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,990
focus on my fingering here i chose to
use my

3292
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,000
use my
 

3293
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,510
use my
index finger for the first one because

3294
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:09,520
index finger for the first one because
 

3295
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,029
index finger for the first one because
that index finger is always the easiest

3296
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:11,039
that index finger is always the easiest
 

3297
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:11,670
that index finger is always the easiest
to use

3298
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:11,680
to use
 

3299
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,190
to use
but also gives me lots of room to move

3300
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,200
but also gives me lots of room to move
 

3301
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,870
but also gives me lots of room to move
my pinky over to here

3302
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:14,880
my pinky over to here
 

3303
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,630
my pinky over to here
and then i like to use my middle finger

3304
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
and then i like to use my middle finger
 

3305
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,069
and then i like to use my middle finger
to come up here

3306
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:18,079
