00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,110

right so uh today is going to be our

00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
right so uh today is going to be our

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,090
right so uh today is going to be our
first I believe of two problem sessions

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,100
first I believe of two problem sessions

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,849

covering dynamic programming

8
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:19,859
covering dynamic programming
 

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,290
covering dynamic programming
um

10
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,300
um
 

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,849
um
I find dynamic programming is one of

12
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:22,859
I find dynamic programming is one of
 

13
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,230
I find dynamic programming is one of
these interesting parts of an algorithms

14
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
these interesting parts of an algorithms
 

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,090
these interesting parts of an algorithms
class where like somehow the people that

16
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,100
class where like somehow the people that
 

17
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,529
class where like somehow the people that
are really good at it are completely

18
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:27,539
are really good at it are completely
 

19
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,029
are really good at it are completely
disjoint with the people that are good

20
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
disjoint with the people that are good
 

21
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,230
disjoint with the people that are good
at all the other parts of the algorithms

22
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
at all the other parts of the algorithms
 

23
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,389
at all the other parts of the algorithms
class so for some of you guys that might

24
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
class so for some of you guys that might
 

25
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,370
class so for some of you guys that might
be promising uh and for others maybe a

26
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:34,380
be promising uh and for others maybe a
 

27
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,350
be promising uh and for others maybe a
little bit less so uh so maybe we'll

28
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360
little bit less so uh so maybe we'll
 

29
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,670
little bit less so uh so maybe we'll
spend just a minute or two kind of

30
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
spend just a minute or two kind of
 

31
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,110
spend just a minute or two kind of
reviewing the basic ideas we're going to

32
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
reviewing the basic ideas we're going to
 

33
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,729
reviewing the basic ideas we're going to
apply uh in these problems because

34
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:40,739
apply uh in these problems because
 

35
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,610
apply uh in these problems because
they'll follow more or less the same

36
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:42,620
they'll follow more or less the same
 

37
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,930
they'll follow more or less the same
template although of course as usual in

38
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:44,940
template although of course as usual in
 

39
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,810
template although of course as usual in
6006 if you like to put some

40
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:47,820
6006 if you like to put some
 

41
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,670
6006 if you like to put some
interesting window dressing around it so

42
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
interesting window dressing around it so
 

43
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,690
interesting window dressing around it so
that it's not totally obvious what

44
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:50,700
that it's not totally obvious what
 

45
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,970
that it's not totally obvious what
you're doing uh uh and then we'll do a

46
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:52,980
you're doing uh uh and then we'll do a
 

47
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,470
you're doing uh uh and then we'll do a
bunch of sample problems

48
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
bunch of sample problems
 

49
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,590
bunch of sample problems
um right so let's let's talk a little

50
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
um right so let's let's talk a little
 

51
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,270
um right so let's let's talk a little
bit about dynamic programming and the

52
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
bit about dynamic programming and the
 

53
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,490
bit about dynamic programming and the
basic uh idea here

54
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:01,500
basic uh idea here
 

55
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,529
basic uh idea here
so dynamic programming is kind of a

56
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:03,539
so dynamic programming is kind of a
 

57
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,350
so dynamic programming is kind of a
funny outlier in 6006 in that like for

58
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,360
funny outlier in 6006 in that like for
 

59
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,910
funny outlier in 6006 in that like for
example in the data structure is part of

60
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
example in the data structure is part of
 

61
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,870
example in the data structure is part of
the course we learned like what you know

62
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:11,880
the course we learned like what you know
 

63
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,429
the course we learned like what you know
struggling to think of a data structure

64
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
struggling to think of a data structure
 

65
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,350
struggling to think of a data structure
like like a useful you know like trees

66
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
like like a useful you know like trees
 

67
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,330
like like a useful you know like trees
and arrays and whatever these are

68
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:17,340
and arrays and whatever these are
 

69
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,590
and arrays and whatever these are
actually things that you can code like

70
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:18,600
actually things that you can code like
 

71
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,510
actually things that you can code like
if you look in C plus plus like there's

72
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,520
if you look in C plus plus like there's
 

73
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,870
if you look in C plus plus like there's
a there are well plausibly it could be

74
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:23,880
a there are well plausibly it could be
 

75
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,730
a there are well plausibly it could be
an implementation of a tree in there

76
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:25,740
an implementation of a tree in there
 

77
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,870
an implementation of a tree in there
some way

78
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
some way
 

79
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,950
some way
um and so these are like useful

80
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:27,960
um and so these are like useful
 

81
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,090
um and so these are like useful
algorithms that you could maybe even

82
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,100
algorithms that you could maybe even
 

83
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,530
algorithms that you could maybe even
read the pseudo code and there's a

84
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:30,540
read the pseudo code and there's a
 

85
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,910
read the pseudo code and there's a
universe where you really do translate

86
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
universe where you really do translate
 

87
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,190
universe where you really do translate
that pseudocode into something inside of

88
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,200
that pseudocode into something inside of
 

89
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,230
that pseudocode into something inside of
your laptop

90
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,240
your laptop
 

91
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,069
your laptop
dynamic programming is a little bit less

92
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,079
dynamic programming is a little bit less
 

93
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,749
dynamic programming is a little bit less
so this is more like a meta I don't know

94
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
so this is more like a meta I don't know
 

95
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,130
so this is more like a meta I don't know
if you call it a meta algorithm or a

96
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,140
if you call it a meta algorithm or a
 

97
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,590
if you call it a meta algorithm or a
problem-solving approach or what

98
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:42,600
problem-solving approach or what
 

99
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,510
problem-solving approach or what
um but it's not like you somehow say I'm

100
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,520
um but it's not like you somehow say I'm
 

101
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,130
um but it's not like you somehow say I'm
going to apply the dynamic programming

102
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,140
going to apply the dynamic programming
 

103
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,410
going to apply the dynamic programming
algorithm to this problem but rather

104
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:48,420
algorithm to this problem but rather
 

105
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,510
algorithm to this problem but rather
it's sort of this big class of things

106
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,520
it's sort of this big class of things
 

107
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,870
it's sort of this big class of things
that all follow a similar template or or

108
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:53,880
that all follow a similar template or or
 

109
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,310
that all follow a similar template or or
sort of approach to thinking about

110
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,320
sort of approach to thinking about
 

111
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,010
sort of approach to thinking about
problem solving which I think sort of

112
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:58,020
problem solving which I think sort of
 

113
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,289
problem solving which I think sort of
explains why actually in some sense the

114
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:00,299
explains why actually in some sense the
 

115
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,389
explains why actually in some sense the
last couple lectures that you've seen

116
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
last couple lectures that you've seen
 

117
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,090
last couple lectures that you've seen
and I guess if I'm getting the the time

118
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,100
and I guess if I'm getting the the time
 

119
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,530
and I guess if I'm getting the the time
sequence of our course right the next

120
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:06,540
sequence of our course right the next
 

121
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,990
sequence of our course right the next
couple ones that you will see

122
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,000
couple ones that you will see
 

123
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,249
couple ones that you will see
um and the problem sessions actually

124
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:10,259
um and the problem sessions actually
 

125
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,470
um and the problem sessions actually
start to coincide in the sense that like

126
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
start to coincide in the sense that like
 

127
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,970
start to coincide in the sense that like
when Eric was teaching your diet's

128
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:13,980
when Eric was teaching your diet's
 

129
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,070
when Eric was teaching your diet's
dynamic programming how did he do it

130
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
dynamic programming how did he do it
 

131
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,809
dynamic programming how did he do it
well he didn't like write down well he

132
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:17,819
well he didn't like write down well he
 

133
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,070
well he didn't like write down well he
sort of wrote down some template for

134
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,080
sort of wrote down some template for
 

135
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,390
sort of wrote down some template for
dynamic programming but then we just did

136
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
dynamic programming but then we just did
 

137
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,070
dynamic programming but then we just did
a bunch of sample problems and that's

138
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
a bunch of sample problems and that's
 

139
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,050
a bunch of sample problems and that's
exactly what we're going to do today uh

140
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,060
exactly what we're going to do today uh
 

141
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,670
exactly what we're going to do today uh
so somehow all of these things are just

142
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
so somehow all of these things are just
 

143
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,470
so somehow all of these things are just
going to converge uh in in this part of

144
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:27,480
going to converge uh in in this part of
 

145
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,510
going to converge uh in in this part of
our course uh because dynamic

146
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
our course uh because dynamic
 

147
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,729
our course uh because dynamic
programming it's really more of a way of

148
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:31,739
programming it's really more of a way of
 

149
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,510
programming it's really more of a way of
life uh than any particular algorithm uh

150
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,520
life uh than any particular algorithm uh
 

151
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,830
life uh than any particular algorithm uh
and this is a pattern that I think you

152
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:36,840
and this is a pattern that I think you
 

153
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,990
and this is a pattern that I think you
see a lot in advanced algorithms like

154
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
see a lot in advanced algorithms like
 

155
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,430
see a lot in advanced algorithms like
for example in my universe numerical

156
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,440
for example in my universe numerical
 

157
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,770
for example in my universe numerical
analysis like when you talk about the

158
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:42,780
analysis like when you talk about the
 

159
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,390
analysis like when you talk about the
ADM algorithm it's actually totally

160
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
ADM algorithm it's actually totally
 

161
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,770
ADM algorithm it's actually totally
useless algorithm what matters is

162
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:45,780
useless algorithm what matters is
 

163
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,589
useless algorithm what matters is
applying it to a particular problem uh

164
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:48,599
applying it to a particular problem uh
 

165
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,690
applying it to a particular problem uh
and and this is a sort of I think a more

166
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:50,700
and and this is a sort of I think a more
 

167
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,490
and and this is a sort of I think a more
mature or grown-up way to think about a

168
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:52,500
mature or grown-up way to think about a
 

169
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,229
mature or grown-up way to think about a
lot of things in algorithms right that

170
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
lot of things in algorithms right that
 

171
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,869
lot of things in algorithms right that
pretty soon this sort of general purpose

172
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
pretty soon this sort of general purpose
 

173
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,750
pretty soon this sort of general purpose
stuff that's useful all the time I think

174
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
stuff that's useful all the time I think
 

175
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,250

I think it starts to disperse a little

176
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,260
I think it starts to disperse a little
 

177
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,410
I think it starts to disperse a little
bit in favor of different patterns and

178
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:03,420
bit in favor of different patterns and
 

179
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,850
bit in favor of different patterns and

00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,340
answer each of these questions and then

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,969

Theory perspective
 

255
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,070
Theory perspective
um so the basic idea here is the there's

256
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,080
um so the basic idea here is the there's
 

257
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,450
um so the basic idea here is the there's
a lot of different problems that can be

258
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,460
a lot of different problems that can be

a lot of different problems that can be
written recursively in some sense uh

260
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
written recursively in some sense uh
 

261
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,150
written recursively in some sense uh
certainly we we've encountered many of

262
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
certainly we we've encountered many of
 

263
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,530
certainly we we've encountered many of
those in this course in fact I think the

264
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:33,540
those in this course in fact I think the
 

265
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,390
those in this course in fact I think the
bias in the way that we've presented

266
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,400
bias in the way that we've presented

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,409

algorithms that don't have to be

268
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:36,419
algorithms that don't have to be
 

269
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,730
algorithms that don't have to be
recursive is to write them in a

270
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:37,740
recursive is to write them in a
 

271
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,230
recursive is to write them in a
recursive way

272
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,240
recursive way
 

273
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,170
recursive way
um and and the point here is that when

274
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,180
um and and the point here is that when
 

275
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,270
um and and the point here is that when
you have a recursive call and you repeat

276
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,280
you have a recursive call and you repeat
 

277
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,610
you have a recursive call and you repeat
something you know you you give the

278
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:46,620
something you know you you give the
 

279
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,930
something you know you you give the
function the same input more than one

280
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:47,940
function the same input more than one
 

281
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,689
function the same input more than one
time you might as well remember what you

282
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:50,699
time you might as well remember what you
 

283
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,730
time you might as well remember what you
got the last time you saw that input and

284
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:52,740
got the last time you saw that input and
 

285
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,390
got the last time you saw that input and
then you don't have to do that

286
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,400
then you don't have to do that
 

287
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,370
then you don't have to do that
computation again really in one sentence

288
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:55,380
computation again really in one sentence
 

289
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,770
computation again really in one sentence
I think that's roughly the logic behind

290
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:57,780
I think that's roughly the logic behind
 

291
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,749
I think that's roughly the logic behind
all these dynamic programming things

292
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
all these dynamic programming things
 

293
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,490
all these dynamic programming things
yeah so there's no reason to be too

294
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:01,500
yeah so there's no reason to be too
 

295
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,650
yeah so there's no reason to be too
redundant with lecture uh for just sort

of the 10 second overview I think that

298
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,360
of the 10 second overview I think that
 

299
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,490
of the 10 second overview I think that
there's an example which is

300
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,500
there's an example which is
 

301
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,650
there's an example which is
simultaneously good and misleading which

302
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:09,660
simultaneously good and misleading which
 

303
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,710
simultaneously good and misleading which
is this Fibonacci Sequence uh it's good

304
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
is this Fibonacci Sequence uh it's good
 

305
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,749
is this Fibonacci Sequence uh it's good
in the sense that the logic of dynamic

306
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:14,759
in the sense that the logic of dynamic
 

307

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,650

that the run time is kind of weird to

310
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:18,660
that the run time is kind of weird to
 

311
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,150
that the run time is kind of weird to
think about

312
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
think about
 

313
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,770
think about
um but remember those your Fibonacci

314
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:21,780
um but remember those your Fibonacci
 

315
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,890
um but remember those your Fibonacci
Sequence looks something like f of k

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:23,900
Sequence looks something like f of k
 

317
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,990
Sequence looks something like f of k
equals F of K minus 1 plus F of K minus

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
equals F of K minus 1 plus F of K minus

let's say that I do k equals four right

let's say that I do k equals four right
 

327
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,070
let's say that I do k equals four right
then it's going to call you know my

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
then it's going to call you know my
 

329
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,689
then it's going to call you know my
function f is going to have to evaluate

330
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:41,699
function f is going to have to evaluate
 

331
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,570
function f is going to have to evaluate
it at 3 and 2 and then the 3 is going to

332
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:44,580
it at 3 and 2 and then the 3 is going to
 

333
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,850
it at 3 and 2 and then the 3 is going to
evaluate at 2 and 1 and so on

334
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:46,860
evaluate at 2 and 1 and so on
 

335
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,070
evaluate at 2 and 1 and so on
and the thing to notice is that when I

336
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,080
and the thing to notice is that when I
 

337
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,990
and the thing to notice is that when I
call F of 4

338
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,000
call F of 4
 

339
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,170
call F of 4
or rather F of 3 here if there were

340
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,180
or rather F of 3 here if there were
 

341
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,430
or rather F of 3 here if there were
three somewhere else in my tree I get

342
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
three somewhere else in my tree I get
 

343
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,770
three somewhere else in my tree I get
the same number right so in particular F

344
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:57,780
the same number right so in particular F
 

345
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,110
the same number right so in particular F
of 2 and F of 2

346
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,120
of 2 and F of 2
 

347
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,310
of 2 and F of 2
both of these are going to take some

348
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,320
both of these are going to take some
 

349
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,810
both of these are going to take some
amount of algorithmic work but if just

350
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:02,820
amount of algorithmic work but if just
 

351
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,850
amount of algorithmic work but if just
the first time I see a 2 I have a little

352
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:04,860
the first time I see a 2 I have a little
 

353
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,529
the first time I see a 2 I have a little
piece of scratch paper and I say ah

354
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:06,539
piece of scratch paper and I say ah
 

355
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,590
piece of scratch paper and I say ah
anytime I see uh k equals 2 just return

356
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
anytime I see uh k equals 2 just return
 

357
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,330
anytime I see uh k equals 2 just return
this number rather than doing recursive

358
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,340
this number rather than doing recursive
 

359
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,730
this number rather than doing recursive
calls then in fact if there's any

360
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:13,740
calls then in fact if there's any
 

361
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,969
calls then in fact if there's any
subtree underneath this thing uh I I've

362
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:16,979
subtree underneath this thing uh I I've
 

363
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,310
subtree underneath this thing uh I I've
just pruned it from my tree right and

364
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,320
just pruned it from my tree right and
 

365
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,730
just pruned it from my tree right and
and and so that's the basic logic here

366
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:21,740
and and so that's the basic logic here
 

367
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,110
and and so that's the basic logic here
uh and that's basically this the the

368
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,120
uh and that's basically this the the
 

369
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,909
uh and that's basically this the the
Paradigm that's going on in this this

370
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
Paradigm that's going on in this this
 

371
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,029
Paradigm that's going on in this this

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,350
right uh
yeah so the first thing I want to do is

392
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
yeah so the first thing I want to do is
 

393
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,350
yeah so the first thing I want to do is
to write my my problem as sort of

394
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
to write my my problem as sort of
 

395
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,450
to write my my problem as sort of
this sort of form notice that we've done

396
00:06:59,450 --> 00:06:59,460
this sort of form notice that we've done
 

397
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,890
this sort of form notice that we've done
this a lot in this class we've written

398
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:00,900
this a lot in this class we've written
 

399
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,450
this a lot in this class we've written
things recursively the difference here

400
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:02,460
things recursively the difference here
 

401
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,730
things recursively the difference here
is the the sort of argument that goes

402
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:04,740
is the the sort of argument that goes
 

403
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,529
is the the sort of argument that goes
into recursion is typically maybe a

404
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:06,539
into recursion is typically maybe a
 

405
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,510
into recursion is typically maybe a
little simpler than you know like

406
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:08,520
little simpler than you know like
 

407
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,370
little simpler than you know like
putting some giant data structure inside

408
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:10,380
putting some giant data structure inside
 

409
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,350
putting some giant data structure inside
of there or something like that right so

410
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,360
of there or something like that right so
 

411
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,270
of there or something like that right so
for instance merged sort you could write

412
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,280
for instance merged sort you could write
 

413
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,890
for instance merged sort you could write
in this Paradigm I guess we covered that

414
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:15,900
in this Paradigm I guess we covered that
 

415
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,150
in this Paradigm I guess we covered that
but it's probably not the most natural

416
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,160
but it's probably not the most natural
 

417
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,249
but it's probably not the most natural
way to think about merge sort

418
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:19,259
way to think about merge sort
 

419
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,710
way to think about merge sort
then we need to relate our sub problems

420
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:21,720
then we need to relate our sub problems
 

421
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,689
then we need to relate our sub problems
to each other so for instance in the

422
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:23,699
to each other so for instance in the
 

423
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,790
to each other so for instance in the
Fibonacci sequence problem I just gave

424
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800
Fibonacci sequence problem I just gave
 

425
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,050
Fibonacci sequence problem I just gave
you the relation that sort of what

426
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,060
you the relation that sort of what
 

427
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,370
you the relation that sort of what
defines the problem

428
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:28,380
defines the problem
 

429
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,129
defines the problem
incidentally this is what a model for

430
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:31,139
incidentally this is what a model for
 

431
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,249
incidentally this is what a model for
the reproduction of rabbits I think if I

432
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:34,259
the reproduction of rabbits I think if I
 

433
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,689
the reproduction of rabbits I think if I
remember reading the history of the

434
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:35,699
remember reading the history of the
 

435
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,850
remember reading the history of the
Fibonacci sequence

436
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:37,860
Fibonacci sequence
 

437
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,110
Fibonacci sequence
um

438
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
um
 

439
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,870
um
and then I think to me the most not

440
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:41,880
and then I think to me the most not
 

441
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,309
and then I think to me the most not
necessarily unnatural but I think the

442
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:43,319
necessarily unnatural but I think the
 

443
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,870
necessarily unnatural but I think the
thing that maybe is hardest to translate

444
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
thing that maybe is hardest to translate
 

445
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,490
thing that maybe is hardest to translate
to an algorithm if you're thinking about

446
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:46,500
to an algorithm if you're thinking about
 

447
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,770
to an algorithm if you're thinking about
writing code is this like oh man this is

448
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:48,780
writing code is this like oh man this is
 

449
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,050
writing code is this like oh man this is
going to be a problem uh this idea of

450
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,060
going to be a problem uh this idea of
 

451
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,350
going to be a problem uh this idea of
topological uh order the basic idea here

452
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,360
topological uh order the basic idea here
 

453
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,689
topological uh order the basic idea here
is that like if F of one depended on F

454
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:56,699
is that like if F of one depended on F
 

455
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,990
is that like if F of one depended on F
of 2 and F of 2 dependent on F of 1

456
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
of 2 and F of 2 dependent on F of 1
 

457
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,850
of 2 and F of 2 dependent on F of 1
I'd be in a lot of trouble right because

458
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:01,860
I'd be in a lot of trouble right because
 

459
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,070
I'd be in a lot of trouble right because
somehow my tree would never converge

460
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
somehow my tree would never converge
 

461
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,450
somehow my tree would never converge
from one thing if I made these recursive

462
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:05,460
from one thing if I made these recursive
 

463
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,510
from one thing if I made these recursive
calls and I'd never be able to memoize

464
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:08,520
calls and I'd never be able to memoize
 

465
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,550
calls and I'd never be able to memoize
or kind of remember a value uh when I

466
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
or kind of remember a value uh when I
 

467
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,529
or kind of remember a value uh when I
move on right and so the idea here is

468
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:12,539
move on right and so the idea here is
 

469
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:13,909
move on right and so the idea here is
that there's some ordering of my sub

470
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
that there's some ordering of my sub
 

471
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,290
that there's some ordering of my sub
problem so that I can build up a

472
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,300
problem so that I can build up a
 

473
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,550
problem so that I can build up a
solution

474
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
solution
 

475
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,710
solution
and there's sort of two dual ways to

476
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
and there's sort of two dual ways to
 

477
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,330
and there's sort of two dual ways to
think about why that's useful

478
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,340
think about why that's useful
 

479
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,749
think about why that's useful
so in the memoization universe right

480
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
so in the memoization universe right
 

481
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,490
so in the memoization universe right
what do I do I just add an if statement

482
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:25,500
what do I do I just add an if statement
 

483
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,050
what do I do I just add an if statement
saying you know if I've already

484
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,060
saying you know if I've already
 

485
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,869
saying you know if I've already
evaluated F okay return it that's

486
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:29,879
evaluated F okay return it that's
 

487
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,449
evaluated F okay return it that's
perfectly fine the other thing I can do

488
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:32,459
perfectly fine the other thing I can do
 

489
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,190
perfectly fine the other thing I can do
is if I write my sub problems in

490
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,200
is if I write my sub problems in
 

491
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,110
is if I write my sub problems in
topological order

492
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,120
topological order
 

493
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,029
topological order
then I can sort of go in the reverse

494
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:38,039
then I can sort of go in the reverse
 

495
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,610
then I can sort of go in the reverse
Direction and build up my memoization

496
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:40,620
Direction and build up my memoization
 

497
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,029
Direction and build up my memoization
table so for instance uh for uh the

498
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:44,039
table so for instance uh for uh the
 

499
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,710

Fibonacci sequence problem I could do F

500
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
Fibonacci sequence problem I could do F
 

501
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,030
Fibonacci sequence problem I could do F
of one and then F of two and then F of

502
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
of one and then F of two and then F of
 

503
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,590
of one and then F of two and then F of
three and F of four

504
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:48,600
three and F of four
 

505
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,329
three and F of four
all the way until I get to the K value

506
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:50,339
all the way until I get to the K value
 

507
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,829
all the way until I get to the K value
that I actually wanted and those are

508
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
that I actually wanted and those are
 

509
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,750
that I actually wanted and those are
just Duels of the the same coin they're

510
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
just Duels of the the same coin they're
 

511
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,150
just Duels of the the same coin they're
exactly the same approach of the

512
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
exactly the same approach of the
 

513
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,769
exactly the same approach of the
memoization version sometimes you can

514
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:57,779
memoization version sometimes you can
 

515
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,269
memoization version sometimes you can
prune out some problems that you didn't

516
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
prune out some problems that you didn't
 

517
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,130
prune out some problems that you didn't
actually need to solve so for instance

518
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,140
actually need to solve so for instance
 

519
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,829
actually need to solve so for instance
maybe this was F of K minus seven and so

520
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
maybe this was F of K minus seven and so
 

521
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,449
maybe this was F of K minus seven and so
I can like skip a few indices in my

522
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:05,459
I can like skip a few indices in my
 

523
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,290
I can like skip a few indices in my
array

524
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,300
array
 

525
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,389
array
I don't think typically that has a big

526
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
I don't think typically that has a big
 

527
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,949
I don't think typically that has a big
effect on runtime for the problems that

528
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:09,959
effect on runtime for the problems that
 

529
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,630
effect on runtime for the problems that
we've seen but it could

530
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:11,640
we've seen but it could
 

531
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,850
we've seen but it could
um plausibly uh in some Universal I'd

532
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:13,860
um plausibly uh in some Universal I'd
 

533
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,470
um plausibly uh in some Universal I'd
have to think about a problem where that

534
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:15,480
have to think about a problem where that
 

535
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,050
have to think about a problem where that
that makes a difference

536
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,060
that makes a difference
 

537
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,870
that makes a difference
um right and then I think the bot part

538
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
um right and then I think the bot part
 

539
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,070
um right and then I think the bot part
of swordpod is a little easier to think

540
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
of swordpod is a little easier to think
 

541
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,810
of swordpod is a little easier to think
about uh you have to make sure that this

542
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:23,820
about uh you have to make sure that this
 

543
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,030
about uh you have to make sure that this
recursion has you know a base case like

544
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,040
recursion has you know a base case like
 

545
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,009
recursion has you know a base case like
when is this thing going to stop that's

546
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:28,019
when is this thing going to stop that's
 

547
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,930
when is this thing going to stop that's
exactly the same it's just any recursive

548
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:29,940
exactly the same it's just any recursive
 

549
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,370
exactly the same it's just any recursive
algorithm

550
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:31,380
algorithm
 

551
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,670
algorithm
um the O for original I think is a

552
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680
um the O for original I think is a
 

553
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,009
um the O for original I think is a
little bit retro retrofit to to make

554
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:37,019
little bit retro retrofit to to make
 

555
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,870
little bit retro retrofit to to make
short but sound nice but I think the

556
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
short but sound nice but I think the
 

557
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,250
short but sound nice but I think the
idea here is that you need to go back to

558
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,260
idea here is that you need to go back to
 

559
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,810
idea here is that you need to go back to
original problem and make sure that it

560
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:41,820
original problem and make sure that it
 

561
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,449
original problem and make sure that it
corresponds to one of the function calls

562
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:44,459
corresponds to one of the function calls
 

563
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,470
corresponds to one of the function calls
that you've written and all those

564
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,480
that you've written and all those
 

565
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,150
that you've written and all those
complicated stuff hopefully that's a

566
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,160
complicated stuff hopefully that's a
 

567
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,949
complicated stuff hopefully that's a
reasonable characterization and then

568
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
reasonable characterization and then
 

569
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,829
reasonable characterization and then
finally the t is more you know these are

570
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
finally the t is more you know these are
 

571
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,750
finally the t is more you know these are
for describing your algorithm the last

572
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
for describing your algorithm the last
 

573
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,310
for describing your algorithm the last
ones for analyzing it

574
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,320
ones for analyzing it
 

575
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,829
ones for analyzing it
um and again the the bot part of sortbot

576
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
um and again the the bot part of sortbot
 

577
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,509
um and again the the bot part of sortbot
almost applies to anything we've done in

578
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
almost applies to anything we've done in
 

579
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,550
almost applies to anything we've done in
6006 like you should always analyze your

580
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560
6006 like you should always analyze your
 

581
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,930
6006 like you should always analyze your
runtime

582
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:02,940
runtime
 

583
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,170
runtime
um okay so in any event that's my

584
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,180
um okay so in any event that's my
 

585
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,329
um okay so in any event that's my
10 minute version of uh the last couple

586
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:08,339
10 minute version of uh the last couple
 

587
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,370
10 minute version of uh the last couple
lectures uh and I think more or less

588
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:10,380
lectures uh and I think more or less
 

589
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,530
lectures uh and I think more or less
enough to get us started with some

590
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:12,540
enough to get us started with some
 

591
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,970
enough to get us started with some
sample problems here

592
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:13,980
sample problems here
 

593
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,829
sample problems here
sorry I couldn't help it I like to teach

594
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
sorry I couldn't help it I like to teach
 

595
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,610
sorry I couldn't help it I like to teach
things

things
okay so uh right so in our problem

598
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
okay so uh right so in our problem
 

599
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,290
okay so uh right so in our problem
session we have a few of the homework

600
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:21,300
session we have a few of the homework
 

601
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,650
session we have a few of the homework
problems from last year uh to go over

602
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:24,660
problems from last year uh to go over
 

603
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,190
problems from last year uh to go over
um

604

um
 

605
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,050
um
if it makes you guys feel any better I

606
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,060
if it makes you guys feel any better I
 

607
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,790
if it makes you guys feel any better I
got myself all balled up on one of them

608
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
got myself all balled up on one of them
 

609
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,170
got myself all balled up on one of them
last night while I Was preparing for

610
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,180
last night while I Was preparing for
 

611
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,030
last night while I Was preparing for
today and I I look forward to doing that

612
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,040
today and I I look forward to doing that
 

613
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,030
today and I I look forward to doing that
in front of all of you guys now uh right

614
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
in front of all of you guys now uh right
 

615
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,829
in front of all of you guys now uh right
so

616

so
 

617
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,389
so
I'm afraid of this so I'm going to go to

618
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
I'm afraid of this so I'm going to go to
 

619
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,070
I'm afraid of this so I'm going to go to
the next port

620
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,080
the next port
 

621
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,889
the next port
um okay so in our first problem uh Sunny

622
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:42,899
um okay so in our first problem uh Sunny
 

623
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,630
um okay so in our first problem uh Sunny

this was somehow you know the like cute

626
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:46,380
this was somehow you know the like cute
 

627
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,530
this was somehow you know the like cute
naming conventions we have in 6006 got

628
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:48,540
naming conventions we have in 6006 got
 

629
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,389
naming conventions we have in 6006 got
really meta in this problem because

630
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
really meta in this problem because
 

631
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,069
really meta in this problem because
there's a problem about Tim the beaver

632
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
there's a problem about Tim the beaver
 

633
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,710
there's a problem about Tim the beaver
uh but as we all know uh Tim is MIT

634
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
uh but as we all know uh Tim is MIT
 

635
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,650
uh but as we all know uh Tim is MIT
backwards so like he happens to fit into

636
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:57,660
backwards so like he happens to fit into
 

637
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,210
backwards so like he happens to fit into
this goofy

638
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,220
this goofy

game that Jason likes to play in in

640
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,140
game that Jason likes to play in in
 

641
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,110
game that Jason likes to play in in
writing homework problems anyway

642
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
writing homework problems anyway
 

643
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,329
writing homework problems anyway
um but it's also the MIT mascot

644
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:05,339
um but it's also the MIT mascot
 

645
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,730
um but it's also the MIT mascot
anyways I got very excited

646
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:07,740
anyways I got very excited
 

647
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,769
anyways I got very excited
um right so so what's going on in this

648
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:09,779
um right so so what's going on in this
 

649
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:10,910
um right so so what's going on in this
problem

650
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:10,920
problem
 

651
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,670
problem
so Tim the beaver has kind of an

652
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
so Tim the beaver has kind of an
 

653
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,009
so Tim the beaver has kind of an
interesting uh you know mathematics I

654
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:16,019
interesting uh you know mathematics I
 

655
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,449
interesting uh you know mathematics I
think you would call this a Martingale

656
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:17,459
think you would call this a Martingale
 

657
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,949
think you would call this a Martingale
as you flip the coin a little bit when

658
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
as you flip the coin a little bit when
 

659
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,829
as you flip the coin a little bit when
he saw this problem but uh luckily Tim

660
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
he saw this problem but uh luckily Tim
 

661
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,990
he saw this problem but uh luckily Tim
the beaver is a deterministic uh kind of

662
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
the beaver is a deterministic uh kind of
 

663
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,910
the beaver is a deterministic uh kind of
a guy uh and he looks at the weather

664
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
a guy uh and he looks at the weather
 

665
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,230
a guy uh and he looks at the weather
outside

666
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,240
outside
 

667
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,389
outside
and if it's a temperature tee apparently

668
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:29,399
and if it's a temperature tee apparently
 

669
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,790
and if it's a temperature tee apparently
Tim the beaver is okay with with boiling

670
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:31,800
Tim the beaver is okay with with boiling
 

671
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,949
Tim the beaver is okay with with boiling
um the higher the temperature uh the

672
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:33,959
um the higher the temperature uh the
 

673
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,410
um the higher the temperature uh the
happier Tim gets so this is the first

674
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:36,420
happier Tim gets so this is the first
 

675
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,050
happier Tim gets so this is the first
derivative kind of a phenomenon in

676
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,060
derivative kind of a phenomenon in
 

677
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,110
derivative kind of a phenomenon in
particular uh on a on a given day if I

678
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,120
particular uh on a on a given day if I
 

679
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,009
particular uh on a on a given day if I
have a temperature t uh Tim the beaver

680
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:46,019
have a temperature t uh Tim the beaver
 

681
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,710
have a temperature t uh Tim the beaver
has two things that he can do to change

682
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
has two things that he can do to change
 

683
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,810
has two things that he can do to change
his mood apparently Tim the beaver's

684
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:50,820
his mood apparently Tim the beaver's
 

685
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,610
his mood apparently Tim the beaver's
mood never stays fixed it always goes up

686
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:52,620
mood never stays fixed it always goes up
 

687
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,990
mood never stays fixed it always goes up
and down

688
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
and down
 

689
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,710
and down
um

690
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
um
 

691
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,650
um
in particular you can either

692
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,660
in particular you can either
 

693
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,530
in particular you can either
uh go outside

694
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:03,540

 

695
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,069

in which case the happiness increases by

696
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:07,079
in which case the happiness increases by
 

697
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:14,269
in which case the happiness increases by
T

698
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:14,279

 

699
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:21,350

okay or he can stay inside

700
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360

 

701
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,190

in which case his happiness decreases

702
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,200

 

703
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,050

by T okay so every day Tim the beaver uh

704
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,060
by T okay so every day Tim the beaver uh
 

705
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,389
by T okay so every day Tim the beaver uh
he wakes up he he

706
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:35,399
he wakes up he he
 

707
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,009
he wakes up he he
I really want to say that he checks for

708
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:37,019
I really want to say that he checks for
 

709
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,509
I really want to say that he checks for
his shadow but that's that's a gopher

710
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:38,519
his shadow but that's that's a gopher
 

711
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,410
his shadow but that's that's a gopher
right

712
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:39,420
right
 

713
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,970
right
um in any event he wakes up in the

714
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:40,980
um in any event he wakes up in the
 

715
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,550
um in any event he wakes up in the
morning he checks the weather uh and he

716
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:43,560
morning he checks the weather uh and he
 

717
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,110
morning he checks the weather uh and he
makes a determination does he want to go

718
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
makes a determination does he want to go
 

719
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,090
makes a determination does he want to go
outside or not and if he goes outside he

720
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,100
outside or not and if he goes outside he
 

721
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,889
outside or not and if he goes outside he
gets happier by an amount that's equal

722
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:48,899
gets happier by an amount that's equal
 

723
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,269
gets happier by an amount that's equal
to the temperature

724
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,279
to the temperature
 

725
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,210
to the temperature
if he stays inside he gets less Happy by

726
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,220
if he stays inside he gets less Happy by
 

727
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,410
if he stays inside he gets less Happy by
an amount that's equal to the

728
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:54,420
an amount that's equal to the
 

729
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,550
an amount that's equal to the
temperature by the way I think our

730
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:55,560
temperature by the way I think our
 

731
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,810
temperature by the way I think our
solution is perfectly fine if

732
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:56,820
solution is perfectly fine if
 

733
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,329
solution is perfectly fine if
temperatures are negative here in which

734
00:12:59,329 --> 00:12:59,339
temperatures are negative here in which
 

735
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,310
temperatures are negative here in which
case I guess everything would kind of

736
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,320
case I guess everything would kind of
 

737
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,650
case I guess everything would kind of
flip uh intuitively but there's no

738
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:03,660
flip uh intuitively but there's no
 

739
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,170
flip uh intuitively but there's no
reason to get too hung up on that

740
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:06,180
reason to get too hung up on that
 

741
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,050
reason to get too hung up on that
but of course there's a Twist here

742
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,060
but of course there's a Twist here
 

743
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,329
but of course there's a Twist here
um so Tim

744
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:11,339
um so Tim
 

745
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,370
um so Tim
as with many of you has end days

746
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,380

 

747
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,970

until his final exam

748
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:22,980

 

749
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,730

and he's worried about studying yeah so

750
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:25,740
and he's worried about studying yeah so
 

751
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,290
and he's worried about studying yeah so
uh in particular

752
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:27,300
uh in particular
 

753
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,129
uh in particular
um

754
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:28,139
um
 

755
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,410
um
he never wants to go he's you know he's

756
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:30,420
he never wants to go he's you know he's
 

757
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,090
he never wants to go he's you know he's
come up with a personal resolve to never

758
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,100
come up with a personal resolve to never
 

759
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,610
come up with a personal resolve to never
go outside more than two days in a row

760
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:34,620
go outside more than two days in a row
 

761
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,590
go outside more than two days in a row
yeah

762
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:36,600
yeah
 

763
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,690
yeah
um so right

764
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:38,700
um so right
 

765
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:47,509
um so right
um

766
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519

 

767
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,210

and so

768
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:50,220
and so
 

769
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,009
and so
the question is right because that way

770
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:52,019
the question is right because that way
 

771
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,509
the question is right because that way
you know he has to stay inside and study

772
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
you know he has to stay inside and study
 

773
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,030
you know he has to stay inside and study
at least one out of every three-ish days

774
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,040
at least one out of every three-ish days
 

775
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,930
at least one out of every three-ish days
okay so the question is how can Tim

776
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:58,940
okay so the question is how can Tim
 

777
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,449
okay so the question is how can Tim
maximize his uh his happiness

778
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:02,459
maximize his uh his happiness
 

779
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,069
maximize his uh his happiness
incidentally that's you know machine

780
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
incidentally that's you know machine
 

781
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,090
incidentally that's you know machine
learning sometimes they call that

782
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:05,100
learning sometimes they call that
 

783
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,829
learning sometimes they call that
minimizing regret which I always found

784
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:06,839
minimizing regret which I always found
 

785
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,050
minimizing regret which I always found
to be like a very sad way to think about

786
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,060
to be like a very sad way to think about
 

787
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,850
to be like a very sad way to think about
algorithms when there's a totally dual

788
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:10,860
algorithms when there's a totally dual
 

789
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,769
algorithms when there's a totally dual
version but but Tim's an optimistic guy

790
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:12,779
version but but Tim's an optimistic guy
 

791
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,269
version but but Tim's an optimistic guy
he wants to maximize his happiness

792
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:14,279
he wants to maximize his happiness
 

793
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,210
he wants to maximize his happiness
subject to this constraint the he cannot

794
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,220
subject to this constraint the he cannot
 

795
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,949
subject to this constraint the he cannot
go outside more than two days in a row

796
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
go outside more than two days in a row
 

797
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,750
go outside more than two days in a row
right so like if I go out on Monday and

798
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:20,760
right so like if I go out on Monday and
 

799
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,490
right so like if I go out on Monday and
Tuesday I have to stay inside on

800
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:22,500
Tuesday I have to stay inside on
 

801
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,870
Tuesday I have to stay inside on
Wednesday

802
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:23,880
Wednesday
 

803
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,030
Wednesday
yes I think there's no effect to his

804
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,040
yes I think there's no effect to his
 

805
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,129
yes I think there's no effect to his
happiness when he stays in there's no

806
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:28,139
happiness when he stays in there's no
 

807
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:34,009
happiness when he stays in there's no
effect to his happiness when he stays in

808
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:34,019

 

809
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,110

uh no it says with a decrease in

810
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,120
uh no it says with a decrease in
 

811
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,490
uh no it says with a decrease in
happiness when T oh when T is negative

812
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:40,500

 

813
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,689

that's not actually going to affect our

814
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:41,699
that's not actually going to affect our
 

815
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:42,580
that's not actually going to affect our
problem at all

816
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,590
problem at all
 

817
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,210
problem at all
[Laughter]

818
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,220
[Laughter]
 

819
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,170
[Laughter]
sure yeah I can fix this life uh and

820
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:50,180
sure yeah I can fix this life uh and
 

821
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,370
sure yeah I can fix this life uh and
this is what happens when I do the

822
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:52,380
this is what happens when I do the
 

823
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,810
this is what happens when I do the
problem myself before looking at the

824
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:53,820
problem myself before looking at the
 

825
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,269
problem myself before looking at the
answer and then don't check it closely

826
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:56,279
answer and then don't check it closely
 

827
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,090
answer and then don't check it closely
um fine so uh let's let's change that

828
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,100
um fine so uh let's let's change that
 

829
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,550
um fine so uh let's let's change that
I like this problem better uh somehow

830
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:01,560
I like this problem better uh somehow
 

831
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,650
I like this problem better uh somehow
psychologically but that's okay

832
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:03,660
psychologically but that's okay
 

833
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,170
psychologically but that's okay
um right so uh Jason correctly points

834
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,180
um right so uh Jason correctly points
 

835
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,490
um right so uh Jason correctly points
out that if you actually read the

836
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:07,500
out that if you actually read the
 

837
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,310
out that if you actually read the
problem uh what's what's uh asked there

838
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
problem uh what's what's uh asked there
 

839
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,530
problem uh what's what's uh asked there
is is slightly different that when he

840
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:12,540
is is slightly different that when he
 

841
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,150
is is slightly different that when he
goes outside his happiness increases by

842
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
goes outside his happiness increases by
 

843
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,970
goes outside his happiness increases by
T if he stays inside his happiness does

844
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:16,980
T if he stays inside his happiness does
 

845
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,949
T if he stays inside his happiness does
nothing right so

846
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
nothing right so
 

847
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,170
nothing right so
um it stays

848
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,180
um it stays
 

849
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,509
um it stays
the same

850
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
the same
 

851
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,129
the same
my apologies so

852
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:25,139
my apologies so
 

853
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,689
my apologies so
um Tim the beaver is a particularly

854
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:26,699
um Tim the beaver is a particularly
 

855
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,790
um Tim the beaver is a particularly
optimistic fever his happiness can only

856
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
optimistic fever his happiness can only
 

857
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,189
optimistic fever his happiness can only
increase in time assuming he lives in a

858
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
increase in time assuming he lives in a
 

859
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,470
increase in time assuming he lives in a
climate with positive temperatures okay

860
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:33,480
climate with positive temperatures okay
 

861
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,509
climate with positive temperatures okay
now I think I've got it right now

862
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
now I think I've got it right now
 

863
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,850
now I think I've got it right now
cool let's see if I

864
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:37,860
cool let's see if I
 

865
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,650
cool let's see if I
can still do this

866
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:39,660
can still do this
 

867
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,230
can still do this
yeah I think basically nothing changes

868
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
yeah I think basically nothing changes
 

869
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,650
yeah I think basically nothing changes
okay that's great

870
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:45,660

 

871
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,470

all right we're gonna do it

872
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
all right we're gonna do it
 

873
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,470
all right we're gonna do it
um

874
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:51,480

 

875
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,650

okay so right so the question is how do

876
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:54,660
okay so right so the question is how do
 

877
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,930
okay so right so the question is how do
we uh solve this problem uh and and

878
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:56,940
we uh solve this problem uh and and
 

879
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,250
we uh solve this problem uh and and
thankfully I think we put the easiest

880
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,260
thankfully I think we put the easiest
 

881
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,170
thankfully I think we put the easiest
problem first uh and in particular if

882
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:00,180
problem first uh and in particular if
 

883
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,269
problem first uh and in particular if
we're we're following our ballot

884
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:02,279
we're we're following our ballot
 

885
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,009
we're we're following our ballot
Paradigm here

886
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:04,019
Paradigm here
 

887
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,930
Paradigm here
um somehow there's there's a set of sub

888
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:05,940
um somehow there's there's a set of sub
 

889
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,790
um somehow there's there's a set of sub
problems that are staring Us in the in

890
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:07,800
problems that are staring Us in the in
 

891
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,829
problems that are staring Us in the in
the in the face that's the word I'm

892
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
the in the face that's the word I'm
 

893
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,389
the in the face that's the word I'm
looking for uh in particular uh

894
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
looking for uh in particular uh
 

895
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,490
looking for uh in particular uh
well there's sort of only one index in

896
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:16,500
well there's sort of only one index in
 

897
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,829
well there's sort of only one index in
our problem which is what day it is so

898
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:18,839
our problem which is what day it is so
 

899
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,230
our problem which is what day it is so
the obvious thing to do would be to say

900
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,240
the obvious thing to do would be to say
 

901
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,810
the obvious thing to do would be to say
can we figure out the maximum amount of

902
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:23,820
can we figure out the maximum amount of
 

903
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,710
can we figure out the maximum amount of
happiness for days say I to the last day

904
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:27,720
happiness for days say I to the last day
 

905
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,389
happiness for days say I to the last day
by the way if I do that I'm using the

906
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:29,399
by the way if I do that I'm using the
 

907
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,210
by the way if I do that I'm using the
prefix version of my problem uh ah

908
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:32,220
prefix version of my problem uh ah
 

909
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,069
prefix version of my problem uh ah
suffix version of my problem I could

910
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
suffix version of my problem I could
 

911
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,870
suffix version of my problem I could
also do it the opposite way and work

912
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:35,880
also do it the opposite way and work
 

913
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,610
also do it the opposite way and work
from the end back in

914
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:37,620
from the end back in
 

915
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,810
from the end back in
um maybe if we have time all the way at

916
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:38,820
um maybe if we have time all the way at
 

917
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,550
um maybe if we have time all the way at
the end we'll do the second one but it

918
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
the end we'll do the second one but it
 

919
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,170
the end we'll do the second one but it
doesn't doesn't really matter

920
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,180
doesn't doesn't really matter
 

921
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,569
doesn't doesn't really matter
okay so in particular

922
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:44,579
okay so in particular
 

923
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,430
okay so in particular
um just to add a little bit of notation

924
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:46,440
um just to add a little bit of notation
 

925
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,350
um just to add a little bit of notation
let's say that uh T of I is equal to the

926
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
let's say that uh T of I is equal to the
 

927
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,030
let's say that uh T of I is equal to the
temperature

928
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
temperature
 

929
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,310
temperature
on day

930
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:55,320
on day
 

931
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,370
on day
I okay

932
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:57,380
I okay
 

933
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,230
I okay
and now we're going to make a new thing

934
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
and now we're going to make a new thing
 

935
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,790
and now we're going to make a new thing
which is going to be the actual variable

936
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:01,800
which is going to be the actual variable
 

937
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,590
which is going to be the actual variable
we want to compute this is going to be X

938
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
we want to compute this is going to be X
 

939
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,730
we want to compute this is going to be X
of I

940
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:04,740
of I
 

941
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,049
of I
which we'll write is the

942
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:08,059
which we'll write is the
 

943
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:12,829
which we'll write is the
maximum happiness

944
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:12,839

 

945
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,829

that you can achieve if you only

946
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
that you can achieve if you only
 

947
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,490
that you can achieve if you only
consider the calendar from day I

948
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:19,500
consider the calendar from day I
 

949
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,730
consider the calendar from day I
to day n I guess inclusive

950
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:22,740
to day n I guess inclusive
 

951
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,789
to day n I guess inclusive
okay uh incidentally just for

952
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:25,799
okay uh incidentally just for
 

953
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,710
okay uh incidentally just for
convenience we'll assume that x i is

954
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:27,720
convenience we'll assume that x i is
 

955
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,770
convenience we'll assume that x i is
equal to zero if I go past the end of my

956
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:29,780
equal to zero if I go past the end of my
 

957
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,750
equal to zero if I go past the end of my
array which I think is kind of a typical

958
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:32,760
array which I think is kind of a typical
 

959
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,650
array which I think is kind of a typical
thing to do in these DP algorithms

960
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:36,660
thing to do in these DP algorithms
 

961
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,409
thing to do in these DP algorithms
okay so the question is can we actually

962
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:39,419
okay so the question is can we actually
 

963
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,930
okay so the question is can we actually
come up with a recursive algorithm that

964
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:41,940
come up with a recursive algorithm that
 

965
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,490
come up with a recursive algorithm that
computes X I uh using this nice uh sort

966
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:46,500
computes X I uh using this nice uh sort
 

967
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,950
computes X I uh using this nice uh sort
of topologically acyclic

968
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
of topologically acyclic
 

969
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,770
of topologically acyclic
uh way of of thinking about our problem

970
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:51,780
uh way of of thinking about our problem
 

971
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,210
uh way of of thinking about our problem
the answer is obviously yes or I

972
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,220
the answer is obviously yes or I
 

973
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,890
the answer is obviously yes or I
wouldn't be here today

974
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:54,900
wouldn't be here today
 

975
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,650
wouldn't be here today
um and and so you know in the absence of

976
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:57,660
um and and so you know in the absence of
 

977
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,450
um and and so you know in the absence of
a smarter idea let's let's just do the

978
00:17:59,450 --> 00:17:59,460
a smarter idea let's let's just do the
 

979
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,669
a smarter idea let's let's just do the
the Toucan Sam approach here and follow

980
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
the Toucan Sam approach here and follow
 

981
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,810
the Toucan Sam approach here and follow
our nose and see if we can just write

982
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:05,820
our nose and see if we can just write
 

983
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,850
our nose and see if we can just write
our problem in terms of other ones

984
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:07,860
our problem in terms of other ones
 

985
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,250
our problem in terms of other ones
so in general let's say the the Tim the

986
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:10,260
so in general let's say the the Tim the
 

987
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,049
so in general let's say the the Tim the
beaver wakes up on day I

988
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,059
beaver wakes up on day I
 

989
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,470
beaver wakes up on day I
he has basically two decisions that he

990
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:15,480
he has basically two decisions that he
 

991
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,289
he has basically two decisions that he
can make right he can either stay inside

992
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:18,299
can make right he can either stay inside
 

993
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,810
can make right he can either stay inside
or he can not stay inside he can go

994
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:20,820
or he can not stay inside he can go
 

995
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,650
or he can not stay inside he can go
outside

996
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,660
outside
 

997
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,390
outside
uh right so so let's let's just

998
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:23,400
uh right so so let's let's just
 

999
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,490
uh right so so let's let's just
basically uh

1000
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:25,500
basically uh
 

1001
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,450
basically uh
handle these three cases so in case one

1002
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:29,460
handle these three cases so in case one
 

1003
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,350
handle these three cases so in case one
um he stays inside

1004
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360

 

1005
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,710

well now what happens to his happiness

1006
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
well now what happens to his happiness
 

1007
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,650
well now what happens to his happiness
well according to my revised version of

1008
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:39,660
well according to my revised version of
 

1009
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,350
well according to my revised version of
this problem nothing right so uh in

1010
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:42,360
this problem nothing right so uh in
 

1011
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,310
this problem nothing right so uh in
particular

1012
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,320
particular
 

1013
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,909
particular
um

1014
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
um
 

1015
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,010
um
what do we know well if he stays inside

1016
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,020
what do we know well if he stays inside
 

1017
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,390
what do we know well if he stays inside
then he has

1018
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:47,400
then he has
 

1019
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,130
then he has
any decision he can make tomorrow it

1020
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,140
any decision he can make tomorrow it
 

1021
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,510
any decision he can make tomorrow it
doesn't matter he can go inside and go

1022
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:50,520
doesn't matter he can go inside and go
 

1023
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,789
doesn't matter he can go inside and go
outside whatever because by having

1024
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
outside whatever because by having
 

1025
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,370
outside whatever because by having
stayed inside he's earned himself two

1026
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:55,380
stayed inside he's earned himself two
 

1027
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,529
stayed inside he's earned himself two
free days of going outside if he wants

1028
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:57,539
free days of going outside if he wants
 

1029
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,010
free days of going outside if he wants
right so in particular in this case we

1030
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,020
right so in particular in this case we
 

1031
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,090
right so in particular in this case we
can convince ourselves that

1032
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,100

 

1033
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,770

this is true in our uh I think yes

1034
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:09,780
this is true in our uh I think yes
 

1035
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,450
this is true in our uh I think yes
um right so in other words uh well he

1036
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,460
um right so in other words uh well he
 

1037
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,250
um right so in other words uh well he
gets no utility for today he wakes up

1038
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:13,260
gets no utility for today he wakes up
 

1039
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,270
gets no utility for today he wakes up
tomorrow and he can make whatever

1040
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,280
tomorrow and he can make whatever
 

1041
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,310
tomorrow and he can make whatever
decision he wants

1042
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
decision he wants
 

1043
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,770
decision he wants
okay

1044
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:18,780
okay
 

1045
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:25,610
okay
the second thing he can do is go out

1046
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:25,620

 

1047
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,070

this is where things get a little tricky

1048
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
this is where things get a little tricky
 

1049
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,070
this is where things get a little tricky
right can I just do like you know

1050
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,080
right can I just do like you know
 

1051
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,370
right can I just do like you know
take TI and add it to x i plus one what

1052
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:34,380
take TI and add it to x i plus one what
 

1053
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,350
take TI and add it to x i plus one what
goes wrong

1054
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360

 

1055
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,970

maybe you go three days in a row right

1056
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:40,980
maybe you go three days in a row right
 

1057
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,529
maybe you go three days in a row right
you you somehow have to remember that

1058
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:42,539
you you somehow have to remember that
 

1059
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,529
you you somehow have to remember that
right uh and and so that's where things

1060
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:45,539
right uh and and so that's where things
 

1061
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,690
right uh and and so that's where things
are a little bit of a headache

1062
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:47,700
are a little bit of a headache
 

1063
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,330
are a little bit of a headache
um the in particular if I go out

1064
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:50,340
um the in particular if I go out
 

1065
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,669
um the in particular if I go out
today and tomorrow I can't go out the

1066
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:52,679
today and tomorrow I can't go out the
 

1067
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:53,990
today and tomorrow I can't go out the
day after that

1068
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
day after that
 

1069
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,390
day after that
um and somehow if we just uh dealt with

1070
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
um and somehow if we just uh dealt with
 

1071
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,730
um and somehow if we just uh dealt with
this one case as t i plus x i plus one

1072
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:58,740
this one case as t i plus x i plus one
 

1073
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,110
this one case as t i plus x i plus one
we wouldn't remember that right and

1074
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,120
we wouldn't remember that right and
 

1075
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,730
we wouldn't remember that right and
that's a problem

1076
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:01,740
that's a problem
 

1077
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,130
that's a problem
so instead what we can do is think of

1078
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:04,140
so instead what we can do is think of
 

1079
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,890
so instead what we can do is think of
there being two sub cases right so what

1080
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:06,900
there being two sub cases right so what
 

1081
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,690
there being two sub cases right so what
we're going to assume is that not only

1082
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:08,700
we're going to assume is that not only
 

1083
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,510
we're going to assume is that not only
does he go out today but he's free to go

1084
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
does he go out today but he's free to go
 

1085
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,190
does he go out today but he's free to go
out tomorrow and we're going to kind of

1086
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
out tomorrow and we're going to kind of
 

1087
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,990
out tomorrow and we're going to kind of
make that recursive assumption as we we

1088
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,000
make that recursive assumption as we we
 

1089
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,430
make that recursive assumption as we we
move down on our way

1090
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:16,440
move down on our way
 

1091
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,130
move down on our way
uh so if we do that uh

1092
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,140
uh so if we do that uh
 

1093
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,370
uh so if we do that uh
well now we have case a and case b so in

1094
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:22,380
well now we have case a and case b so in
 

1095
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,870
well now we have case a and case b so in
case a

1096
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:23,880
case a
 

1097
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,750
case a
he goes out today and he stays in

1098
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:26,760
he goes out today and he stays in
 

1099
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:35,090
he goes out today and he stays in
tomorrow

1100
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,100

 

1101
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,549

yeah okay so what happens in this case

1102
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:37,559
yeah okay so what happens in this case
 

1103
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,669
yeah okay so what happens in this case
well

1104
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:40,679

 

1105
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,350

by the way I'm using this kind of weird

1106
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,360
by the way I'm using this kind of weird
 

1107
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,970
by the way I'm using this kind of weird
arrow notation I don't know if this is

1108
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:43,980
arrow notation I don't know if this is
 

1109
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,350
arrow notation I don't know if this is
good or not but essentially the point is

1110
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
good or not but essentially the point is
 

1111
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,210
good or not but essentially the point is
that I'm keeping track of cases and then

1112
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:47,220
that I'm keeping track of cases and then
 

1113
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,230
that I'm keeping track of cases and then
eventually going to want to have to take

1114
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
eventually going to want to have to take
 

1115
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,750
eventually going to want to have to take
the max over all of these things

1116
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:50,760
the max over all of these things
 

1117
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,190
the max over all of these things
so I don't like the equal sign because

1118
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,200
so I don't like the equal sign because
 

1119
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,770
so I don't like the equal sign because
somehow that's a little misleading

1120
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:54,780
somehow that's a little misleading
 

1121
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,810
somehow that's a little misleading
um right so in that case well he gets

1122
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:56,820
um right so in that case well he gets
 

1123
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,549
um right so in that case well he gets
the utility of having gone out today

1124
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:01,559
the utility of having gone out today
 

1125
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,190
the utility of having gone out today
tomorrow he stays in

1126
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,200
tomorrow he stays in
 

1127
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,110
tomorrow he stays in
which means that the day after tomorrow

1128
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,120
which means that the day after tomorrow
 

1129
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,490
which means that the day after tomorrow
he can do whatever the heck he wants

1130
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:07,500
he can do whatever the heck he wants
 

1131
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,610
he can do whatever the heck he wants
right he has he has free ring so

1132
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:10,620
right he has he has free ring so
 

1133
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,770
right he has he has free ring so
I can write that

1134
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:12,780
I can write that
 

1135
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,470
I can write that
using this recursive call

1136
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:15,480
using this recursive call
 

1137
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,710
using this recursive call
okay uh similarly

1138
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:21,720

 

1139
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,510

uh right so

1140
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:26,520

 

1141
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,529

I'm getting the hang of this

1142
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:29,539
I'm getting the hang of this
 

1143
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,210
I'm getting the hang of this
sorry this is way too entertaining for

1144
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:32,220
sorry this is way too entertaining for
 

1145
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,430
sorry this is way too entertaining for
me I can play with this board all day

1146
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:34,440
me I can play with this board all day
 

1147
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,370
me I can play with this board all day
um okay so in in case 2B

1148
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:37,380
um okay so in in case 2B
 

1149
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,409
um okay so in in case 2B
he goes out today and he goes out

1150
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:39,419
he goes out today and he goes out
 

1151
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:45,409
he goes out today and he goes out
tomorrow

1152
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:45,419

 

1153
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,330

Okay so

1154
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,340
Okay so
 

1155
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,909
Okay so
he's a party animal he is an animal and

1156
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
he's a party animal he is an animal and
 

1157
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,409
he's a party animal he is an animal and
he's going out a lot

1158
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:51,419
he's going out a lot
 

1159
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:52,970
he's going out a lot
um right so in that case what happens

1160
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:52,980
um right so in that case what happens
 

1161
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,370
um right so in that case what happens
well he gets that

1162
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:55,380
well he gets that
 

1163
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,230
well he gets that
he gets uh

1164
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,240
he gets uh
 

1165
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,970
he gets uh
today's utility

1166
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:58,980
today's utility
 

1167
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,470
today's utility
he gets tomorrow's utility

1168
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:03,480

 

1169
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,950

uh the day after he has to stay in so we

1170
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
uh the day after he has to stay in so we
 

1171
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,110
uh the day after he has to stay in so we
might as well skip it

1172
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
might as well skip it
 

1173
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,430
might as well skip it
and then he can do whatever he wants

1174
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440

 

1175
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,310

the day after that okay

1176
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
the day after that okay
 

1177
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,029
the day after that okay
so if we go back I guess technically

1178
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:20,039
so if we go back I guess technically
 

1179
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,149
so if we go back I guess technically
we should revise our definition of x a

1180
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:23,159
we should revise our definition of x a
 

1181
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,890
we should revise our definition of x a
tiny bit that it's not the maximum

1182
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:24,900
tiny bit that it's not the maximum
 

1183
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,570
tiny bit that it's not the maximum
happiness well we can convince ourselves

1184
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:26,580
happiness well we can convince ourselves
 

1185
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,190
happiness well we can convince ourselves
that it's the same thing but really it's

1186
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,200
that it's the same thing but really it's
 

1187
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,930
that it's the same thing but really it's
not the maximum in the happiness for day

1188
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:29,940
not the maximum in the happiness for day
 

1189
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,029
not the maximum in the happiness for day
I through n it's the maximum happiness

1190
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:32,039
I through n it's the maximum happiness
 

1191
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,310
I through n it's the maximum happiness
for day I through n under the assumption

1192
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
for day I through n under the assumption
 

1193
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,230
for day I through n under the assumption
that he has permission to go out on day

1194
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
that he has permission to go out on day
 

1195
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,010
that he has permission to go out on day
I

1196
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,020
I
 

1197
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,110
I
right and that's really what's going on

1198
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
right and that's really what's going on
 

1199
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,990
right and that's really what's going on
in our our recursive set of calls here

1200
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
in our our recursive set of calls here
 

1201
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,510
in our our recursive set of calls here
okay so does our recursion uh make sense

1202
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,520
okay so does our recursion uh make sense
 

1203
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,830
okay so does our recursion uh make sense
here

1204
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
here
 

1205
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,029
here
cool all right so uh let's see here so

1206
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:50,039
cool all right so uh let's see here so
 

1207
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,310
cool all right so uh let's see here so
if we're following our sort but I keep

1208
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
if we're following our sort but I keep
 

1209
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,450
if we're following our sort but I keep
reviewing papers that use the word

1210
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:53,460
reviewing papers that use the word
 

1211
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,070
reviewing papers that use the word
Paradigm a lot so I feel I feel like I

1212
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,080
Paradigm a lot so I feel I feel like I
 

1213
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,890
Paradigm a lot so I feel I feel like I
should do that so what is T is the

1214
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:57,900
should do that so what is T is the
 

1215
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,450
should do that so what is T is the
topological order

1216
00:22:59,450 --> 00:22:59,460
topological order
 

1217
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,909
topological order
notice uh that

1218
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
notice uh that
 

1219
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,610
notice uh that
um right x i

1220
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:04,620
um right x i
 

1221
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,529
um right x i
only depends

1222
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:06,539
only depends
 

1223
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,549
only depends
on larger eyes

1224
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559

 

1225
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,470

so in terms of our topological order the

1226
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
so in terms of our topological order the
 

1227
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,730
so in terms of our topological order the
dependence graph is really simple right

1228
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:13,740
dependence graph is really simple right
 

1229
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,169
dependence graph is really simple right
it's just a line

1230
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:15,179
it's just a line
 

1231
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,570
it's just a line
um so remember that you can think about

1232
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:17,580
um so remember that you can think about
 

1233
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,490
um so remember that you can think about
topological order or you can think about

1234
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:19,500
topological order or you can think about
 

1235
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,990
topological order or you can think about
being a cyclic graph those are

1236
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,000
being a cyclic graph those are
 

1237
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,310
being a cyclic graph those are
equivalent we covered that in this

1238
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
equivalent we covered that in this
 

1239
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,690
equivalent we covered that in this
course I kind of like thinking about

1240
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:23,700
course I kind of like thinking about
 

1241
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,549
course I kind of like thinking about
acyclic graphs

1242
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:25,559
acyclic graphs
 

1243
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,770
acyclic graphs
um right so X1 depends on x2 depends on

1244
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:27,780
um right so X1 depends on x2 depends on
 

1245
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,169
um right so X1 depends on x2 depends on
X3 it depends on X4 that graph has no

1246
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:30,179
X3 it depends on X4 that graph has no
 

1247
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,289
X3 it depends on X4 that graph has no
Cycles so we're good

1248
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:33,299
Cycles so we're good
 

1249
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,350
Cycles so we're good
um wait what's our so

1250
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,360
um wait what's our so
 

1251
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,270
um wait what's our so
next we have to come up with our base

1252
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,280
next we have to come up with our base
 

1253
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,070
next we have to come up with our base
case for our recursion

1254
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
case for our recursion
 

1255
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,770
case for our recursion
notice the the way I have chosen to

1256
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:42,780
notice the the way I have chosen to
 

1257
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,289
notice the the way I have chosen to
solve this problem is uh by calling

1258
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:45,299
solve this problem is uh by calling
 

1259
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,230
solve this problem is uh by calling
future indices which means that my base

1260
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
future indices which means that my base
 

1261
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,049
future indices which means that my base
case says at the end of my array right

1262
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:51,059
case says at the end of my array right
 

1263
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,370
case says at the end of my array right
because that's sort of like the lowest

1264
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:52,380
because that's sort of like the lowest
 

1265
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,190
because that's sort of like the lowest
down in the recursion train uh recursion

1266
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
down in the recursion train uh recursion
 

1267
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,390
down in the recursion train uh recursion
chain is what it's going for but I kind

1268
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,400
chain is what it's going for but I kind
 

1269
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,730
chain is what it's going for but I kind
of like the recursion train better

1270
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:58,740
of like the recursion train better
 

1271
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,510
of like the recursion train better
um in particular on day n

1272
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,520
um in particular on day n
 

1273
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,250
um in particular on day n
well if he has permission to go out on

1274
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:04,260
well if he has permission to go out on
 

1275
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,630
well if he has permission to go out on
day and

1276
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:05,640
day and
 

1277
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,529
day and
um

1278
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:06,539
um
 

1279
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,149
um
he can do one of two things he can

1280
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
he can do one of two things he can
 

1281
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,470
he can do one of two things he can
either go out or not it doesn't matter

1282
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:09,480
either go out or not it doesn't matter
 

1283
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,409
either go out or not it doesn't matter
right so in particular we can say that

1284
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:12,419
right so in particular we can say that
 

1285
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,149
right so in particular we can say that
that's

1286
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
that's
 

1287
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,770
that's
the max of 0 or t of n remember I didn't

1288
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:18,780
the max of 0 or t of n remember I didn't
 

1289
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,970
the max of 0 or t of n remember I didn't
tell you that temperatures have to be

1290
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:19,980
tell you that temperatures have to be
 

1291
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,909
tell you that temperatures have to be
positive yeah maybe he's uh he's a

1292
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:22,919
positive yeah maybe he's uh he's a
 

1293
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,710
positive yeah maybe he's uh he's a
Celsius kind of a beaver

1294
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
Celsius kind of a beaver
 

1295
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,070
Celsius kind of a beaver
okay uh uh right and and then in

1296
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,080
okay uh uh right and and then in
 

1297
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,510
okay uh uh right and and then in
addition to that

1298
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
addition to that
 

1299
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,250
addition to that
um

1300
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,260
um
 

1301
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,710
um
for convenience notice that like there's

1302
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:33,720
for convenience notice that like there's
 

1303
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,029
for convenience notice that like there's
a universe where I look beyond the end

1304
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
a universe where I look beyond the end
 

1305
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,730
a universe where I look beyond the end
of my array in my recursive call here

1306
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:37,740
of my array in my recursive call here
 

1307
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,110
of my array in my recursive call here
um so I should probably think about a

1308
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
um so I should probably think about a
 

1309
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,510
um so I should probably think about a
few extra X's uh obviously the utility

1310
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
few extra X's uh obviously the utility
 

1311
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,370
few extra X's uh obviously the utility
of going out on a day that doesn't exist

1312
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:43,380
of going out on a day that doesn't exist
 

1313
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,789
of going out on a day that doesn't exist
is zero uh so we can say that x n plus

1314
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
is zero uh so we can say that x n plus
 

1315
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,190
is zero uh so we can say that x n plus
one equals x n plus two equals zero

1316
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,200
one equals x n plus two equals zero
 

1317
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,390
one equals x n plus two equals zero
okay

1318
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:53,400
okay
 

1319
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,190
okay
I've managed to use way too much space

1320
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
I've managed to use way too much space
 

1321
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,770
I've managed to use way too much space
for one simple algorithm problem

1322
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:00,780

 

1323
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,230

okay so

1324
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240

 

1325
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,310

yeah

1326
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:09,320

 

1327
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,770

okay good credit for that okay

1328
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:12,780
okay good credit for that okay
 

1329
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,169
okay good credit for that okay
um right so now uh we need to do the O

1330
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:15,179
um right so now uh we need to do the O
 

1331
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,630
um right so now uh we need to do the O
and the t uh so what's our original

1332
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:17,640
and the t uh so what's our original
 

1333
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,149
and the t uh so what's our original
problem

1334
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159

 

1335
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,010

well remember that he wants to maximize

1336
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,020
well remember that he wants to maximize
 

1337
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,289
well remember that he wants to maximize
his happiness starting on day one

1338
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:24,299
his happiness starting on day one
 

1339
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,850
his happiness starting on day one
um so our original problem is just X of

1340
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:28,860
um so our original problem is just X of
 

1341
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,049
um so our original problem is just X of
one

1342
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:30,059
one
 

1343
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,390
one
um

1344
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400

 

1345
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,450

or is it so remember that Tim the beaver

1346
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:35,460
or is it so remember that Tim the beaver
 

1347
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,190
or is it so remember that Tim the beaver
this is you know your instructor is very

1348
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
this is you know your instructor is very
 

1349
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,930
this is you know your instructor is very
sloppy when it comes to actually reading

1350
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:38,940
sloppy when it comes to actually reading
 

1351
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,570
sloppy when it comes to actually reading
the problems as you saw at the beginning

1352
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,580
the problems as you saw at the beginning
 

1353
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,370
the problems as you saw at the beginning
um a second mistake for which I would

1354
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:43,380
um a second mistake for which I would
 

1355
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,590
um a second mistake for which I would
have personally lost points where I to

1356
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:45,600
have personally lost points where I to
 

1357
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,850
have personally lost points where I to
solve this problem on my homework is

1358
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:46,860
solve this problem on my homework is
 

1359
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,730
solve this problem on my homework is
that it didn't ask for just the maximum

1360
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:48,740
that it didn't ask for just the maximum
 

1361
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,590
that it didn't ask for just the maximum
amount of happiness that Tim could

1362
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
amount of happiness that Tim could
 

1363
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,870
amount of happiness that Tim could
achieve that's not very practical for

1364
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:53,880
achieve that's not very practical for
 

1365
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,990
achieve that's not very practical for
your everyday Beaver uh but rather

1366
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,000
your everyday Beaver uh but rather
 

1367
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,789
your everyday Beaver uh but rather
um he wants to know the actual plan he

1368
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
um he wants to know the actual plan he
 

1369
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,930
um he wants to know the actual plan he
wants to know what days he can go out

1370
00:25:59,930 --> 00:25:59,940
wants to know what days he can go out
 

1371
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,510
wants to know what days he can go out
and what days he can't yeah and I

1372
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:02,520
and what days he can't yeah and I
 

1373
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,470
and what days he can't yeah and I
haven't actually told you how to do that

1374
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,480
haven't actually told you how to do that
 

1375
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,090
haven't actually told you how to do that
right I've only told you how to compute

1376
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,100
right I've only told you how to compute
 

1377
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,310
right I've only told you how to compute
X which is just the maximum amount of

1378
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:07,320
X which is just the maximum amount of
 

1379
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,590
X which is just the maximum amount of
happiness

1380
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
happiness
 

1381
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,690
happiness
if I were you guys I I think this is a

1382
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:11,700
if I were you guys I I think this is a
 

1383
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,250
if I were you guys I I think this is a
perfectly reasonable simplification

1384
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:13,260
perfectly reasonable simplification
 

1385
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,750
perfectly reasonable simplification
that's like a warm-up problem to solve

1386
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:14,760
that's like a warm-up problem to solve
 

1387
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,010
that's like a warm-up problem to solve
in fact I would argue it's less of a

1388
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,020
in fact I would argue it's less of a
 

1389
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,289
in fact I would argue it's less of a
warm up and more the Crux of the problem

1390
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:18,299
warm up and more the Crux of the problem
 

1391
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,149
warm up and more the Crux of the problem
uh and then going back and making sure

1392
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
uh and then going back and making sure
 

1393
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,890
uh and then going back and making sure
you can convince yourself that you could

1394
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:21,900
you can convince yourself that you could
 

1395
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,350
you can convince yourself that you could
actually reconstruct the solution

1396
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,360
actually reconstruct the solution
 

1397
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,289
actually reconstruct the solution
um my way of solving this was ever so

1398
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:27,299
um my way of solving this was ever so
 

1399
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:28,490
um my way of solving this was ever so
slightly different from the one in the

1400
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:28,500
slightly different from the one in the
 

1401
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,830
slightly different from the one in the
problem but they're equivalent

1402
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:30,840
problem but they're equivalent
 

1403
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,570
problem but they're equivalent
um which is to say I can make a second

1404
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:32,580
um which is to say I can make a second
 

1405
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,610
um which is to say I can make a second
array I won't write it down because I'm

1406
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:34,620
array I won't write it down because I'm
 

1407
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,990
array I won't write it down because I'm
slow ready

1408
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
slow ready
 

1409
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,909
slow ready
that just says on every day whether I

1410
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:37,919
that just says on every day whether I
 

1411
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,450
that just says on every day whether I
took option one option 2A or option 2B

1412
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:41,460
took option one option 2A or option 2B
 

1413
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,370
took option one option 2A or option 2B
right and now I can reconstruct my plan

1414
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:43,380
right and now I can reconstruct my plan
 

1415
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,830
right and now I can reconstruct my plan
very easily right so I look at X1 if I

1416
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
very easily right so I look at X1 if I
 

1417
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,710
very easily right so I look at X1 if I
took option one uh then I stay in and I

1418
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
took option one uh then I stay in and I
 

1419
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,510
took option one uh then I stay in and I
look at you know day two

1420
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:50,520
look at you know day two
 

1421
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,049
look at you know day two
if I took option 2A then I can label

1422
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:54,059
if I took option 2A then I can label
 

1423
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,470
if I took option 2A then I can label
today tomorrow and the day after oh wait

1424
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:57,480
today tomorrow and the day after oh wait
 

1425
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,149
today tomorrow and the day after oh wait
uh

1426
00:26:59,149 --> 00:26:59,159
uh
 

1427
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,769
uh
yeah that's right I can label today's

1428
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:00,779
yeah that's right I can label today's
 

1429
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,450
yeah that's right I can label today's
Choice tomorrow's Choice the day is

1430
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:02,460
Choice tomorrow's Choice the day is
 

1431
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,430
Choice tomorrow's Choice the day is
after Choice and then look three days

1432
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:04,440
after Choice and then look three days
 

1433
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,370
after Choice and then look three days
later uh and we're Chris that way

1434
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:07,380
later uh and we're Chris that way
 

1435
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,830
later uh and we're Chris that way
um or option b is is kind of similar

1436
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
um or option b is is kind of similar
 

1437
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,409
um or option b is is kind of similar
right so a reasonable way to reconstruct

1438
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:12,419
right so a reasonable way to reconstruct
 

1439
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,870
right so a reasonable way to reconstruct
the actual set of what days you go out

1440
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
the actual set of what days you go out
 

1441
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,130
the actual set of what days you go out
and what days you go and is this to

1442
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,140
and what days you go and is this to
 

1443
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,510
and what days you go and is this to
remember as you do your your

1444
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
remember as you do your your
 

1445
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,330
remember as you do your your
memorization or or whatever uh whether

1446
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:20,340
memorization or or whatever uh whether
 

1447
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,610
memorization or or whatever uh whether
you did option one two a or 2B and then

1448
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:22,620
you did option one two a or 2B and then
 

1449
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,110
you did option one two a or 2B and then
it's pretty easy to reconstruct from

1450
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,120
it's pretty easy to reconstruct from
 

1451
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,490
it's pretty easy to reconstruct from
there maybe I'll let you guys convince

1452
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:25,500
there maybe I'll let you guys convince
 

1453
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,710
there maybe I'll let you guys convince
yourselves of that at home or in the

1454
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:27,720
yourselves of that at home or in the
 

1455
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,210
yourselves of that at home or in the
last eight seconds if you happen to be

1456
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,220
last eight seconds if you happen to be
 

1457
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,010
last eight seconds if you happen to be
the two audience members that I have

1458
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,020
the two audience members that I have
 

1459
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,350
the two audience members that I have
uh and then finally

1460
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
uh and then finally
 

1461
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,130
uh and then finally
um

1462
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:34,140
um
 

1463
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,950
um
right we need to do our time thing and

1464
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
right we need to do our time thing and
 

1465
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,049
right we need to do our time thing and
most of the time arguments here follow

1466
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:39,059
most of the time arguments here follow
 

1467
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,310
most of the time arguments here follow
more or less the same pattern which is

1468
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
more or less the same pattern which is
 

1469
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,810
more or less the same pattern which is
you count the number of sub problems and

1470
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:41,820
you count the number of sub problems and
 

1471
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,490
you count the number of sub problems and
the time per sub problem you multiply

1472
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:43,500
the time per sub problem you multiply
 

1473
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,470
the time per sub problem you multiply
those two things together uh and you get

1474
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:45,480
those two things together uh and you get
 

1475
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,850
those two things together uh and you get
your run time we're going to see in one

1476
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:46,860
your run time we're going to see in one
 

1477
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,710
your run time we're going to see in one
problem on this problem set that's not

1478
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
problem on this problem set that's not
 

1479
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,330
problem on this problem set that's not
quite right because we have to account

1480
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:50,340
quite right because we have to account
 

1481
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,130
quite right because we have to account
for some pre-computation

1482
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:52,140
for some pre-computation
 

1483
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,769
for some pre-computation
but uh in this case it is

1484
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:54,779
but uh in this case it is
 

1485
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,110
but uh in this case it is
right so

1486
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
right so
 

1487
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,090
right so
right so let's see what are our sub

1488
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,100
right so let's see what are our sub
 

1489
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,370
right so let's see what are our sub
problems here well essentially I guess I

1490
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:01,380
problems here well essentially I guess I
 

1491
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,510
problems here well essentially I guess I
didn't actually say it but you have to

1492
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:02,520
didn't actually say it but you have to
 

1493
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,330
didn't actually say it but you have to
take the max of these three values

1494
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:05,340
take the max of these three values
 

1495
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,110
take the max of these three values
um

1496
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,120
um
 

1497
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,850
um
this is the max of three Expressions

1498
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:07,860
this is the max of three Expressions
 

1499
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,230
this is the max of three Expressions
which have a constant number of plus

1500
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,240
which have a constant number of plus
 

1501
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,149
which have a constant number of plus
signs and lookups in memory and all that

1502
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:11,159
signs and lookups in memory and all that
 

1503
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,850
signs and lookups in memory and all that
good stuff so each subproblem

1504
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:16,860

 

1505
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,070

takes

1506
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,080
takes
 

1507
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,289
takes
order one time

1508
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:21,299
order one time
 

1509
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,630
order one time
how many sub problems are there well

1510
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:23,640
how many sub problems are there well
 

1511
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,230
how many sub problems are there well
there's I guess n plus two uh max if you

1512
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,240
there's I guess n plus two uh max if you
 

1513
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,450
there's I guess n plus two uh max if you
want to be conservative about it uh so

1514
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:29,460
want to be conservative about it uh so
 

1515
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,570
want to be conservative about it uh so
in particular there's order N Sub

1516
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:32,580
in particular there's order N Sub
 

1517
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,370
in particular there's order N Sub
problems

1518
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:34,380
problems
 

1519
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,049
problems
right so all I have to do is multiply

1520
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:36,059
right so all I have to do is multiply
 

1521
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,669
right so all I have to do is multiply
these two things together and my

1522
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
these two things together and my
 

1523
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,930
these two things together and my
algorithm

1524
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:38,940
algorithm
 

1525
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,850
algorithm
takes order and time

1526
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:43,860

 

1527
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,830

and that's our solution to problem

1528
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
and that's our solution to problem
 

1529
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,690
and that's our solution to problem
number one

1530
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:47,700
number one
 

1531
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,490
number one
any questions so far

1532
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:49,500
any questions so far
 

1533
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,529
any questions so far
yes uh-oh

1534
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:51,539
yes uh-oh
 

1535
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,029
yes uh-oh
when I was thinking

1536
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039
when I was thinking
 

1537
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,890
when I was thinking
of problems before him I was wondering

1538
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:54,900
of problems before him I was wondering
 

1539
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,049
of problems before him I was wondering
could you use base cases

1540
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:57,059
could you use base cases
 

1541
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,149
could you use base cases
right now we have two different kinds of

1542
00:28:59,149 --> 00:28:59,159
right now we have two different kinds of
 

1543
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:00,350
right now we have two different kinds of
base case

1544
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:00,360
base case
 

1545
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,409
base case
a base case for x

1546
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:03,419
a base case for x
 

1547
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:07,909
a base case for x
for things after

1548
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919

 

1549
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,269

10 plus 3 equals zero as well what would

1550
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
10 plus 3 equals zero as well what would
 

1551
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,409
10 plus 3 equals zero as well what would
that do

1552
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:12,419
that do
 

1553
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,510
that do
could I remove the first one and add an

1554
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:14,520
could I remove the first one and add an
 

1555
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,789
could I remove the first one and add an
X of n plus three

1556
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
X of n plus three
 

1557
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,909
X of n plus three
yeah I guess that's fine

1558
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919

 

1559
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,710

I'm sorry that's not a particularly

1560
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:21,720
I'm sorry that's not a particularly
 

1561
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,090
I'm sorry that's not a particularly
helpful answer for the people watching

1562
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,100
helpful answer for the people watching
 

1563
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,850
helpful answer for the people watching
on video my answer to this question you

1564
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:25,860
on video my answer to this question you
 

1565
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,769
on video my answer to this question you
can't hear is yes

1566
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:27,779
can't hear is yes
 

1567
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,409
can't hear is yes
um right so uh the question to uh repeat

1568
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:30,419
um right so uh the question to uh repeat
 

1569
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,409
um right so uh the question to uh repeat
uh was you know this base case is

1570
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:33,419
uh was you know this base case is
 

1571
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,269
uh was you know this base case is
somehow kind of complicated looking

1572
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
somehow kind of complicated looking
 

1573
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,070
somehow kind of complicated looking
to be fair it's the one that I was

1574
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,080
to be fair it's the one that I was
 

1575
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,430
to be fair it's the one that I was
giving him assignment but that's okay

1576
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,440
giving him assignment but that's okay
 

1577
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,289
giving him assignment but that's okay
um but the the question is is this truly

1578
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:42,299
um but the the question is is this truly
 

1579
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,990
um but the the question is is this truly
necessary in particular can I get rid of

1580
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,000
necessary in particular can I get rid of
 

1581
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,889
necessary in particular can I get rid of
the xn case and instead add a third day

1582
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:48,899
the xn case and instead add a third day
 

1583
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,350
the xn case and instead add a third day
past the end of time uh which also has

1584
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
past the end of time uh which also has
 

1585
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,190
past the end of time uh which also has
value zero and if you kind of look at

1586
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:55,200
value zero and if you kind of look at
 

1587
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,570
value zero and if you kind of look at
that plus case b I think you uh

1588
00:29:59,570 --> 00:29:59,580
that plus case b I think you uh
 

1589
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,190
that plus case b I think you uh
or rather case a I think you're

1590
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
or rather case a I think you're
 

1591
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,990
or rather case a I think you're
convinced well case A and B for that

1592
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,000
convinced well case A and B for that
 

1593
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,190
convinced well case A and B for that
matter you can convince yourself that

1594
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:04,200
matter you can convince yourself that
 

1595
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,870
matter you can convince yourself that
these are equivalent right

1596
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:05,880
these are equivalent right
 

1597
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,490
these are equivalent right
um that's absolutely right so so I could

1598
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:07,500
um that's absolutely right so so I could
 

1599
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,710
um that's absolutely right so so I could
add a third day after the end of this

1600
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:09,720
add a third day after the end of this
 

1601
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,789
add a third day after the end of this
thing

1602
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
thing
 

1603
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,430
thing
which also has value zero or by the way

1604
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
which also has value zero or by the way
 

1605
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,010
which also has value zero or by the way
I could just say in my code if n is Big

1606
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,020
I could just say in my code if n is Big
 

1607
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,289
I could just say in my code if n is Big
you know if I is bigger than n returns

1608
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:18,299
you know if I is bigger than n returns
 

1609
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,570
you know if I is bigger than n returns
zero that's the same thing

1610
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:20,580
zero that's the same thing
 

1611
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,590
zero that's the same thing
um

1612
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
um
 

1613
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,210
um
yeah and then I guess I don't have to

1614
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,220
yeah and then I guess I don't have to
 

1615
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,010
yeah and then I guess I don't have to
worry about that xn case yeah these are

1616
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,020
worry about that xn case yeah these are
 

1617
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,570
worry about that xn case yeah these are
the same

1618
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:26,580
the same
 

1619
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,669
the same
you know he eats their own

1620
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:28,679
you know he eats their own
 

1621
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,950
you know he eats their own
fabulous question any any others uh that

1622
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
fabulous question any any others uh that
 

1623
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,889
fabulous question any any others uh that
I can answer while we're at it

1624
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:33,899
I can answer while we're at it
 

1625
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:39,110
I can answer while we're at it
cool all right so that's problem one

1626
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120

 

1627
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,130

right

1628
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,140
right
 

1629
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,049
right
I don't like this big Chuck you know

1630
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:42,059
I don't like this big Chuck you know
 

1631
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,149
I don't like this big Chuck you know
okay so problem two is the one that got

1632
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
okay so problem two is the one that got
 

1633
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,350
okay so problem two is the one that got
me all hot and bothered yesterday so

1634
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
me all hot and bothered yesterday so
 

1635
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,090
me all hot and bothered yesterday so
let's see if we do any better uh in

1636
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,100
let's see if we do any better uh in
 

1637
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,710
let's see if we do any better uh in
front of people because that's usually

1638
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
front of people because that's usually
 

1639
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,690
front of people because that's usually
the best way to improve uh problem

1640
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:50,700
the best way to improve uh problem
 

1641
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,230
the best way to improve uh problem
solving skill uh right uh so in problem

1642
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
solving skill uh right uh so in problem
 

1643
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,990
solving skill uh right uh so in problem
two which annoyingly is also probably

1644
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,000
two which annoyingly is also probably
 

1645
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,570
two which annoyingly is also probably
the most practical uh problem on on this

1646
00:30:59,570 --> 00:30:59,580
the most practical uh problem on on this
 

1647
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,750
the most practical uh problem on on this
problem so essentially you have a uh I

1648
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:02,760
problem so essentially you have a uh I
 

1649
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,110
problem so essentially you have a uh I
suppose I should write some stuff down

1650
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,120

 

1651
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,570

right so in problem Oh I used the wrong

1652
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:08,580
right so in problem Oh I used the wrong
 

1653
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,310
right so in problem Oh I used the wrong
side

1654
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
side
 

1655
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,090
side
two uh you have an operating system men

1656
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,100
two uh you have an operating system men
 

1657
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,950
two uh you have an operating system men
X

1658
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:15,960
X
 

1659
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,490
X
whatever uh which is a uh you know

1660
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:19,500
whatever uh which is a uh you know
 

1661
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,789
whatever uh which is a uh you know
apparently it's a very simple

1662
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
apparently it's a very simple
 

1663
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,029
apparently it's a very simple
oh I get it

1664
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
oh I get it
 

1665
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,010
oh I get it
doesn't mean I have to like it

1666
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,020
doesn't mean I have to like it
 

1667
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,070
doesn't mean I have to like it
um right so

1668
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,080
um right so
 

1669
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,690
um right so
in me mix

1670
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:32,700
in me mix
 

1671
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,570
in me mix
um no yeah

1672
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:34,580
um no yeah
 

1673
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,649
um no yeah
uh apparently the only thing that my

1674
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:36,659
uh apparently the only thing that my
 

1675
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,470
uh apparently the only thing that my
operating system can do is uh compute

1676
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:39,480
operating system can do is uh compute
 

1677
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,169
operating system can do is uh compute
edit distance between files and it wants

1678
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:42,179
edit distance between files and it wants
 

1679
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,810
edit distance between files and it wants
to do so efficiently so

1680
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:44,820
to do so efficiently so
 

1681
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,409
to do so efficiently so
we have that a file

1682
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:48,419
we have that a file
 

1683
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:54,409
we have that a file
is a sequence of strings

1684
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:54,419

 

1685
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,529

and I believe we say their length

1686
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:57,539
and I believe we say their length
 

1687
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,690
and I believe we say their length
is less than or equal to K that's going

1688
00:31:59,690 --> 00:31:59,700
is less than or equal to K that's going
 

1689
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,409
is less than or equal to K that's going
to come into play a little bit later

1690
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:02,419
to come into play a little bit later
 

1691
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,029
to come into play a little bit later
and the strings are basically just lines

1692
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
and the strings are basically just lines
 

1693
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,049
and the strings are basically just lines
of the uh the different files so

1694
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:09,059
of the uh the different files so
 

1695
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,090
of the uh the different files so
there's three different ways that we can

1696
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,100
there's three different ways that we can
 

1697
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,830
there's three different ways that we can
change a file

1698
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:12,840
change a file
 

1699
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,450
change a file
um so here are the changes we could do

1700
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:17,460

 

1701
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,269

change number one is to add a line

1702
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:23,279

 

1703
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,690

change number two is to remove a line

1704
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:29,700

 

1705
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,549

and change number three is to swap

1706
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:34,559
and change number three is to swap
 

1707
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,149
and change number three is to swap
but a caveat for

1708
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
but a caveat for
 

1709
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,590
but a caveat for
this this interesting model of of of

1710
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:42,600
this this interesting model of of of
 

1711
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,930
this this interesting model of of of
what's cheap and what's not is that

1712
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:44,940
what's cheap and what's not is that
 

1713
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,909
what's cheap and what's not is that
apparently swapping two lines is cheap

1714
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:46,919
apparently swapping two lines is cheap
 

1715
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,590
apparently swapping two lines is cheap
because they exist in memory like maybe

1716
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:48,600
because they exist in memory like maybe
 

1717
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,549
because they exist in memory like maybe
I'm

1718
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:49,559
I'm
 

1719
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,470
I'm
I don't know using like a linked list or

1720
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:51,480
I don't know using like a linked list or
 

1721
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,230
I don't know using like a linked list or
something to store files and so swapping

1722
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
something to store files and so swapping
 

1723
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,990
something to store files and so swapping
two pointers isn't so bad uh but

1724
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,000
two pointers isn't so bad uh but
 

1725
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,789
two pointers isn't so bad uh but
inserting and removing a line is hard

1726
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
inserting and removing a line is hard
 

1727
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,350
inserting and removing a line is hard
because I don't know memory allocation

1728
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,360
because I don't know memory allocation
 

1729
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,169
because I don't know memory allocation
is expensive like you know Minix is

1730
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:03,179
is expensive like you know Minix is
 

1731
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,090
is expensive like you know Minix is
actually operating on clay tablets and

1732
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,100
actually operating on clay tablets and
 

1733
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,090
actually operating on clay tablets and
you know I can top my clay tablets into

1734
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:08,100
you know I can top my clay tablets into
 

1735
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,710
you know I can top my clay tablets into
different slices and just pick them up

1736
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:09,720
different slices and just pick them up
 

1737
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,990
different slices and just pick them up
and swap them and that's fine but you

1738
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
and swap them and that's fine but you
 

1739
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,490
and swap them and that's fine but you
know if I want to add a line to my file

1740
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:13,500
know if I want to add a line to my file
 

1741
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,490
know if I want to add a line to my file
I have to go to the Tigris and Euphrates

1742
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:16,500
I have to go to the Tigris and Euphrates
 

1743
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,009
I have to go to the Tigris and Euphrates
and pull out the or whatever it was the

1744
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:19,019
and pull out the or whatever it was the
 

1745
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,649
and pull out the or whatever it was the
eugris and the typhraties and and pull

1746
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:21,659
eugris and the typhraties and and pull
 

1747
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,669
eugris and the typhraties and and pull
out a

1748
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:22,679
out a
 

1749
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,769
out a
you know Stone it's a lot of work to

1750
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:24,779
you know Stone it's a lot of work to
 

1751
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,590
you know Stone it's a lot of work to
make a new line or to dispose

1752
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
make a new line or to dispose
 

1753
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,850
make a new line or to dispose
um right so these are expensive

1754
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:31,860

 

1755
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,269

and this is cheap

1756
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
and this is cheap
 

1757
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,310
and this is cheap
right and so the question uh that I'm

1758
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:37,320
right and so the question uh that I'm
 

1759
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,710
right and so the question uh that I'm
trying to say uh that I'm trying to say

1760
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:39,720
trying to say uh that I'm trying to say
 

1761
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,990
trying to say uh that I'm trying to say
and that the problem is trying to ask uh

1762
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,000
and that the problem is trying to ask uh
 

1763
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,710
and that the problem is trying to ask uh
is that you are given

1764
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:45,720

 

1765
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,570

1766
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:47,580

1767
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,630
files
A and B

1768
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640
A and B
 

1769
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,169
A and B
um with n lines each

1770
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:57,179

 

1771
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,110

uh you want to know what the uh

1772
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,120
uh you want to know what the uh
 

1773
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,930
uh you want to know what the uh
the minimum number of non-swap

1774
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:02,940
the minimum number of non-swap
 

1775
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,690
the minimum number of non-swap
operations it'll take and so in other

1776
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:05,700
operations it'll take and so in other
 

1777
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,009
operations it'll take and so in other
words the minimum number of times you

1778
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:07,019
words the minimum number of times you
 

1779
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,409
words the minimum number of times you
need to add and remove lines to

1780
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:09,419
need to add and remove lines to
 

1781
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:12,589
need to add and remove lines to
transform a into B right

1782
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:12,599
transform a into B right
 

1783
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,389
transform a into B right
um

1784
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:16,399

 

1785
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,550

uh

1786
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:18,560
uh
 

1787
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,030
uh
essentially with low cost

1788
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040

 

1789
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,829

and in fact

1790
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:24,839
and in fact
 

1791
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,629
and in fact
just to be nice I think that's actually

1792
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
just to be nice I think that's actually
 

1793
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,790
just to be nice I think that's actually
kind of a critical hint in this problem

1794
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
kind of a critical hint in this problem
 

1795
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,730
kind of a critical hint in this problem
we give you the runtime

1796
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:31,740
we give you the runtime
 

1797
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,829
we give you the runtime
um and I'm going to kind of ignore it in

1798
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:33,839
um and I'm going to kind of ignore it in
 

1799
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,329
um and I'm going to kind of ignore it in
my answer notice that I did something

1800
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:35,339
my answer notice that I did something
 

1801
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,070
my answer notice that I did something
wrong and then go back and fix it this

1802
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,080
wrong and then go back and fix it this
 

1803
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,270
wrong and then go back and fix it this
is different from the way the answer is

1804
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:38,280
is different from the way the answer is
 

1805
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,190
is different from the way the answer is
written where you know God came in and

1806
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,200
written where you know God came in and
 

1807
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,629
written where you know God came in and
said like oh we observe that we're

1808
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:41,639
said like oh we observe that we're
 

1809
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,950
said like oh we observe that we're
probably going to need this thing so

1810
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
probably going to need this thing so
 

1811
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,810
probably going to need this thing so
we're going to go ahead and do it here I

1812
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:44,820
we're going to go ahead and do it here I
 

1813
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,829
we're going to go ahead and do it here I
think that's that's maybe not

1814
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
think that's that's maybe not
 

1815
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,109
think that's that's maybe not
representative of the logic here so

1816
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:48,119
representative of the logic here so
 

1817
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,270
representative of the logic here so
um right so the the runtime here is K

1818
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,280
um right so the the runtime here is K
 

1819
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,869
um right so the the runtime here is K
and plus N squared the first thing to

1820
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:53,879
and plus N squared the first thing to
 

1821
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,669
and plus N squared the first thing to
notice there's a

1822
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
notice there's a
 

1823
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,230
notice there's a
K here

1824
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,240
K here
 

1825
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,870
K here
yeah and and so someday we're gonna have

1826
00:34:59,870 --> 00:34:59,880
yeah and and so someday we're gonna have
 

1827
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,609
yeah and and so someday we're gonna have
to compare our strings

1828
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:01,619
to compare our strings
 

1829
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,310
to compare our strings
right like because that's what K is and

1830
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,320
right like because that's what K is and
 

1831
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,390
right like because that's what K is and
I think that's sort of sort of the hint

1832
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,400
I think that's sort of sort of the hint
 

1833
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,650
I think that's sort of sort of the hint
that's implicit in this problem it's

1834
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:06,660
that's implicit in this problem it's
 

1835
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,530
that's implicit in this problem it's
easy to miss uh and and and so indeed

1836
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:09,540
easy to miss uh and and and so indeed
 

1837
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,550
easy to miss uh and and and so indeed
what we're going to notice is we're

1838
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
what we're going to notice is we're
 

1839
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,510
what we're going to notice is we're
going to look at our solution and say

1840
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:11,520
going to look at our solution and say
 

1841
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,550
going to look at our solution and say
well wait a second if we didn't

1842
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:13,560
well wait a second if we didn't
 

1843
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,650
well wait a second if we didn't
incur a factor of K we must have done

1844
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:15,660
incur a factor of K we must have done
 

1845
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,849
incur a factor of K we must have done
something wrong

1846
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:16,859
something wrong
 

1847
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:18,530
something wrong
um and and indeed that's that's going to

1848
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:18,540
um and and indeed that's that's going to
 

1849
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,630
um and and indeed that's that's going to
be the case but uh

1850
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,640
be the case but uh
 

1851
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,970
be the case but uh
it's only a minor uh

1852
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:22,980
it's only a minor uh
 

1853
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,109
it's only a minor uh
fixed to change it

1854
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119

 

1855
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,290

oh I'm sorry yeah and and um right when

1856
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:30,300
oh I'm sorry yeah and and um right when
 

1857
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,150
oh I'm sorry yeah and and um right when
I swap things uh they have to be

1859
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,210
I swap things uh they have to be

00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:38,510
I can't write at the bottom of the board
um

1864
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:38,520
um
 

1865
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,670
um
that's supposed to be adj for those

1866
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:40,680
that's supposed to be adj for those
 

1867
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,130
that's supposed to be adj for those
watching at home uh but they have to you

1868
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:43,140
watching at home uh but they have to you
 

1869
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,410
watching at home uh but they have to you
can only swap lines that are adjacent

1870
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:45,420

I'll say it out loud rather than try and

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:49,980
I'll say it out loud rather than try and

I'll say it out loud rather than try and
write it because it's going to take like

write it because it's going to take like

00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:01,859
okay so uh
 

1887
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,010
okay so uh
this one was annoying and and and it's

00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,020
this one was annoying and and and it's

um in fact I think if you guys are

1900
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:15,119
um in fact I think if you guys are
 

1901
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,390
um in fact I think if you guys are
looking for intuition on this problem

1902
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:17,400
looking for intuition on this problem
 

1903
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,690
looking for intuition on this problem
you might Google that one first

1904
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:20,700
you might Google that one first
 

1905
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,089
you might Google that one first
um as sort of a Rosa

1906
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:23,099
um as sort of a Rosa
 

1907
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,589
um as sort of a Rosa
oh in fact you're doing a recitation oh

1908
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:24,599
oh in fact you're doing a recitation oh
 

1909
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,910
oh in fact you're doing a recitation oh
that's why it's it's not totally

1910
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920
that's why it's it's not totally
 

1911
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,410
that's why it's it's not totally
unreasonable to come up with the answer

1912
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:27,420
unreasonable to come up with the answer
 

1913
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,210
unreasonable to come up with the answer
here even better

1914
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:29,220
here even better
 

1915
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,829
here even better
um but even if you hadn't you know this

1916
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:30,839
um but even if you hadn't you know this
 

1917
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,510
um but even if you hadn't you know this
is just another dynamic programming uh

1918
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:32,520
is just another dynamic programming uh

00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,950
is just another dynamic programming uh

um
 

1937
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,089
um
I like literally lost two hours of my

1938
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:53,099
I like literally lost two hours of my
 

1939
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,550
I like literally lost two hours of my
life trying to think about editing files

1940
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:55,560
life trying to think about editing files
 

1941
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,230
life trying to think about editing files
from the end up and just getting myself

1942
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,240
from the end up and just getting myself
 

1943
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,630
from the end up and just getting myself
all upset and confused so so here I'm

1944
00:36:59,630 --> 00:36:59,640
all upset and confused so so here I'm
 

1945
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,710
all upset and confused so so here I'm
going to attempt to do it in the other

1946
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
going to attempt to do it in the other
 

1947
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,630
going to attempt to do it in the other
direction and probably introduce a bunch

1948
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:02,640
direction and probably introduce a bunch
 

1949
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,930
direction and probably introduce a bunch
of mistakes in the process so

1950
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:05,940
of mistakes in the process so
 

1951
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,609
of mistakes in the process so
what do we do in dynamic programming if

1952
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:07,619
what do we do in dynamic programming if
 

1953
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,290
what do we do in dynamic programming if
we don't know what else to do we we do

1954
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:09,300
we don't know what else to do we we do
 

1955
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,829
we don't know what else to do we we do
sort sort stuff sort bot uh and so let's

1956
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:12,839
sort sort stuff sort bot uh and so let's
 

1957
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,829
sort sort stuff sort bot uh and so let's
do that here uh so in particular what

1958
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
do that here uh so in particular what
 

1959
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,870
do that here uh so in particular what
are our sub problems this is a little

1960
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:17,880
are our sub problems this is a little
 

1961
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,910
are our sub problems this is a little
bit funky

1962
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:19,920
bit funky
 

1963
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,470
bit funky
it's actually even before we do the S of

1964
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:21,480
it's actually even before we do the S of
 

1965
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,849
it's actually even before we do the S of
sort pack let's think about our problem

1966
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:22,859
sort pack let's think about our problem
 

1967
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,170
sort pack let's think about our problem
a little bit

1968
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:24,180
a little bit
 

1969
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,910
a little bit
um

1970
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920
um
 

1971
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,470
um
let's think about like what it actually

1972
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:27,480
let's think about like what it actually
 

1973
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,650
let's think about like what it actually
means to edit a file because this is

1974
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:30,660
means to edit a file because this is
 

1975
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,870
means to edit a file because this is
what helped me sort of think about the

1976
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:32,880
what helped me sort of think about the
 

1977
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,210
what helped me sort of think about the
right right answer here which is to say

1978
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,220
right right answer here which is to say
 

1979
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,829
right right answer here which is to say
you know so so what's going on I have

1980
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:36,839
you know so so what's going on I have
 

1981
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,990
you know so so what's going on I have
like two documents you know this is

1982
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,000
like two documents you know this is
 

1983
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,470
like two documents you know this is
document a this is document B

1984
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,480
document a this is document B
 

1985
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,150
document a this is document B
right each one of them is composed of a

1986
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
right each one of them is composed of a
 

1987
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,010
right each one of them is composed of a
bunch of lines

1988
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,020
bunch of lines
 

1989
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,750
bunch of lines
and I'm basically trying to turn a into

1990
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:47,760
and I'm basically trying to turn a into
 

1991
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,030
and I'm basically trying to turn a into
B and the only thing I can do is like

1992
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,040
B and the only thing I can do is like
 

1993
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,310
B and the only thing I can do is like
Scribble out a line insert you know just

1994
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,320
Scribble out a line insert you know just
 

1995
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,109
Scribble out a line insert you know just
hit the enter key or do a third thing

1996
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:54,119
hit the enter key or do a third thing
 

1997
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,510
hit the enter key or do a third thing
where I kind of like swap to uh things

1998
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:56,520
where I kind of like swap to uh things
 

1999
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,069
where I kind of like swap to uh things
that are adjacent to one another this is

2000
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:58,079
that are adjacent to one another this is
 

2001
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,930
that are adjacent to one another this is
the only thing I can do

2002
00:37:59,930 --> 00:37:59,940
the only thing I can do
 

2003
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,490
the only thing I can do
and the way that I like to think about

2004
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:01,500
and the way that I like to think about
 

2005
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,650
and the way that I like to think about
this problem

2006
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:03,660
this problem
 

2007
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,089
this problem
there's kind of an annoyance here which

2008
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:05,099
there's kind of an annoyance here which
 

2009
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,770
there's kind of an annoyance here which
I think is a typical annoyance in

2010
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:06,780
I think is a typical annoyance in
 

2011
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,089
I think is a typical annoyance in
dynamic programming problems which is

2012
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:08,099
dynamic programming problems which is
 

2013
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,230
dynamic programming problems which is
that the order of operations

2014
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:11,240
that the order of operations
 

2015
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,250
that the order of operations
suggests that this problem is a lot

2016
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:13,260
suggests that this problem is a lot
 

2017
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,050
suggests that this problem is a lot
combinatorially more difficult than it

2018
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,060
combinatorially more difficult than it
 

2019
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,569
combinatorially more difficult than it
is right because like okay let's think

2020
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:17,579
is right because like okay let's think
 

2021
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,310
is right because like okay let's think
about how I actually edit documents like

2022
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:19,320
about how I actually edit documents like
 

2023
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,050
about how I actually edit documents like
I spend two-thirds of my day editing bad

2024
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,060
I spend two-thirds of my day editing bad
 

2025
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,030
I spend two-thirds of my day editing bad
grad student writing is like you know

2026
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
grad student writing is like you know
 

2027
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,109
grad student writing is like you know
I'm like jumping all over the place

2028
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:24,119
I'm like jumping all over the place
 

2029
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,490
I'm like jumping all over the place
between different lines like first I

2030
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:25,500
between different lines like first I
 

2031
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,050
between different lines like first I
delete this line and then maybe I go to

2032
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,060
delete this line and then maybe I go to
 

2033
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,550
delete this line and then maybe I go to
the bottom of my document delete some

2034
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
the bottom of my document delete some
 

2035
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,069
the bottom of my document delete some
other one that would be a big problem

2036
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:31,079
other one that would be a big problem
 

2037
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,410
other one that would be a big problem
from a dynamic programming perspective I

2038
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:33,420
from a dynamic programming perspective I
 

2039
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,329
from a dynamic programming perspective I
can't jump all over my document because

2040
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:35,339
can't jump all over my document because
 

2041
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,730
can't jump all over my document because
keeping track of that whole edit history

2042
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:37,740
keeping track of that whole edit history
 

2043
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,730
keeping track of that whole edit history
is going to be somehow combinatorially

2044
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:40,740
is going to be somehow combinatorially
 

2045
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,310
is going to be somehow combinatorially
ginormous right I'm not you know the

2046
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:43,320
ginormous right I'm not you know the
 

2047
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,530
ginormous right I'm not you know the
track changes button in Microsoft Word I

2048
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:45,540
track changes button in Microsoft Word I
 

2049
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,810
track changes button in Microsoft Word I
want the minimum number of changes

2050
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:47,820
want the minimum number of changes
 

2051
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,450
want the minimum number of changes
and if I have to recurse over like all

2052
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:50,460
and if I have to recurse over like all
 

2053
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,490
and if I have to recurse over like all
possible edits to every single line in

2054
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:52,500
possible edits to every single line in
 

2055
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,230
possible edits to every single line in
any order that's an awful lot of like

2056
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,240
any order that's an awful lot of like
 

2057
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,849
any order that's an awful lot of like
factorials and Two To The Ends floating

2058
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:55,859
factorials and Two To The Ends floating
 

2059
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:56,990
factorials and Two To The Ends floating
around that that I don't want to have

2060
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,000
around that that I don't want to have
 

2061
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,390
around that that I don't want to have
right and and so that's the sort of Crux

2062
00:38:59,390 --> 00:38:59,400
right and and so that's the sort of Crux
 

2063
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,970
right and and so that's the sort of Crux
of of the challenge here uh is to

2064
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:01,980
of of the challenge here uh is to
 

2065
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,329
of of the challenge here uh is to
organize my approach to editing these

2066
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:05,339
organize my approach to editing these
 

2067
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,670
organize my approach to editing these
files in a way that doesn't require me

2068
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,680
files in a way that doesn't require me
 

2069
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,050
files in a way that doesn't require me
to have to to do this sort of

2070
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:09,060
to have to to do this sort of
 

2071
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,150
to have to to do this sort of
combinatorial jumping all over the place

2072
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:11,160
combinatorial jumping all over the place
 

2073
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,890
combinatorial jumping all over the place
and I think it's also the one where the

2074
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:12,900
and I think it's also the one where the
 

2075
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,450
and I think it's also the one where the
sort of like I know Jerry Kane at

2076
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:14,460
sort of like I know Jerry Kane at
 

2077
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,650
sort of like I know Jerry Kane at
Stanford talks a lot about the the

2078
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:15,660
Stanford talks a lot about the the
 

2079
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,650
Stanford talks a lot about the the
recursive leap of faith you know like

2080
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:18,660
recursive leap of faith you know like
 

2081
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,510
recursive leap of faith you know like
somehow dividing your problem into

2082
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:20,520
somehow dividing your problem into

00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,069
somehow dividing your problem into
organized sub problems that's that's

2084
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
organized sub problems that's that's
 

2085
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,470
organized sub problems that's that's
really where the the challenge uh lives

2086
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480
really where the the challenge uh lives
 

2087
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,550
really where the the challenge uh lives
here

2088
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:25,560
here
 

2089
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,609
here
so if I were a more organized PhD

2090
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:28,619
so if I were a more organized PhD
 

2091
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,490
so if I were a more organized PhD
advisor the way that I would edit a file

2092
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:31,500
advisor the way that I would edit a file
 

2093
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,270
advisor the way that I would edit a file
um

2094
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,280
um
 

2095
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,930
um
or a clay tablet uh I guess in this case

2096
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:35,940
or a clay tablet uh I guess in this case
 

2097
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,210
or a clay tablet uh I guess in this case
um would be linearly right that like I

2098
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:38,220
um would be linearly right that like I
 

2099
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,589
um would be linearly right that like I
might as well do whatever the heck I'm

2100
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
might as well do whatever the heck I'm
 

2101
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,970
might as well do whatever the heck I'm
going to do to line one before I move on

2102
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:40,980
going to do to line one before I move on
 

2103
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,410
going to do to line one before I move on
to line two

2104
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:42,420
to line two
 

2105
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,150
to line two
right and like at the end of the day

2106
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,160
right and like at the end of the day
 

2107
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,829
right and like at the end of the day
like even if I did stuff in a different

2108
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
like even if I did stuff in a different
 

2109
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,450
like even if I did stuff in a different
order you could convince yourself that I

2110
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:47,460
order you could convince yourself that I
 

2111
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,829
order you could convince yourself that I
could always order it in such a way that

2112
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:48,839
could always order it in such a way that
 

2113
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,150
could always order it in such a way that
like all the edits that I do to the

2114
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
like all the edits that I do to the
 

2115
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,310
like all the edits that I do to the
first line kind of happen before lines

2116
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
first line kind of happen before lines
 

2117
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,290
first line kind of happen before lines
later in the document

2118
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:54,300
later in the document
 

2119
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,810
later in the document
uh with the possible exception of this

uh with the possible exception of this
 

2121
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,130
uh with the possible exception of this
swap thing

2122
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:58,140
swap thing
 

2123
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,510
swap thing
um but we'll see that that somehow

2124
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
um but we'll see that that somehow
 

2125
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,630
um but we'll see that that somehow
doesn't matter and and moreover

2126
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:02,640
doesn't matter and and moreover
 

2127
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,670
doesn't matter and and moreover
if I do an edit I might as well do the

2128
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:04,680
if I do an edit I might as well do the
 

2129
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,250
if I do an edit I might as well do the
edit to make things better right like

2130
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:07,260
edit to make things better right like
 

2131
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,569
edit to make things better right like
there's no reason to just start like

2132
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:08,579
there's no reason to just start like
 

2133
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,750
there's no reason to just start like
willy-nilly inserting and removing lines

2134
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:11,760
willy-nilly inserting and removing lines
 

2135
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,770
willy-nilly inserting and removing lines
um I might as well always do an

2136
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:12,780
um I might as well always do an
 

2137
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,710
um I might as well always do an
operation that improves stuff

2138
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:15,720
operation that improves stuff
 

2139
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,349
operation that improves stuff
and so thinking about that sort of logic

2140
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:18,359
and so thinking about that sort of logic
 

2141
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,790
and so thinking about that sort of logic
leads me

2142
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:19,800
leads me
 

2143
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,910
leads me
to the to a particular way that I might

2144
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:22,920
to the to a particular way that I might
 

2145
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,150
to the to a particular way that I might
write down my S my sub problems here

2146
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,160
write down my S my sub problems here
 

2147
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,650
write down my S my sub problems here
which is to say that I'm going to think

2148
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:27,660
which is to say that I'm going to think
 

2149
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,829
which is to say that I'm going to think
about editing my document line by line

2150
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:30,839
about editing my document line by line
 

2151
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:32,990
about editing my document line by line
so in other words like once I've dealt

2152
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,000
so in other words like once I've dealt
 

2153
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,670
so in other words like once I've dealt
with line one meaning that I've found

2154
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:34,680
with line one meaning that I've found
 

2155
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,950
with line one meaning that I've found
some way to mess with it and make it

2156
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
some way to mess with it and make it
 

2157
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,109
some way to mess with it and make it
match line one of the other guy

2158
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:39,119
match line one of the other guy
 

2159
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,970
match line one of the other guy
I'm just gonna kind of think about

2160
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:40,980
I'm just gonna kind of think about
 

2161
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,890
I'm just gonna kind of think about
removing it and then thinking about the

2162
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:42,900
removing it and then thinking about the
 

2163
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,690
removing it and then thinking about the
rest of the document instead of saying

2164
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:44,700
rest of the document instead of saying
 

2165
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,150
rest of the document instead of saying
aha that's then it sounds like recursion

2166
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,160
aha that's then it sounds like recursion
 

2167
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,710
aha that's then it sounds like recursion
and that's right that's how we're going

2168
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:48,720
and that's right that's how we're going
 

2169
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,870
and that's right that's how we're going
to solve this problem okay so in

2170
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
to solve this problem okay so in
 

2171
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,710
to solve this problem okay so in
particular

2172
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:51,720
particular
 

2173
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,750
particular
here's going to be our our thing I'm

2174
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:53,760
here's going to be our our thing I'm
 

2175
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,010
here's going to be our our thing I'm
going to do a slightly different one in

2176
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:55,020
going to do a slightly different one in
 

2177
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,450
going to do a slightly different one in
the solution so you guys should all be

2178
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:56,460
the solution so you guys should all be
 

2179
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,710
the solution so you guys should all be
vigilant

2180
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:57,720
vigilant
 

2181
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,550
vigilant
which is I'm going to write x i j to uh

2182
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:01,560
which is I'm going to write x i j to uh

work
to convert

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:10,980

 

2189
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,470

I'm not a python programmer but

2190
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,480
I'm not a python programmer but
 

2191
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,089
I'm not a python programmer but
hopefully I got this right

2192
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:14,099
hopefully I got this right
 

2193
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,490
hopefully I got this right
um

2194
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:15,500
um
 

2195
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,829
um
I colon is going to be everything from I

2196
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:18,839
I colon is going to be everything from I
 

2197
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,050
I colon is going to be everything from I
to the end of the file right so in other

2198
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,060
to the end of the file right so in other
 

2199
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,250
to the end of the file right so in other
words this is the

2200
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:22,260
words this is the
 

2201
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,089
words this is the
suffix version of our problem

2202
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:26,099

 

2203
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,230

um and uh the uh into

J colon
 

2209
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:36,589
J colon
like that

2210
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:36,599
like that
 

2211
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,670
like that
okay

2212
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
okay
 

2213
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,470
okay
um so in other words like I have like a

00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:39,480
um so in other words like I have like a
 

2215
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,910
um so in other words like I have like a
little it's kind of like a video you

2216
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:40,920
little it's kind of like a video you
 

2217
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,410
little it's kind of like a video you
know like I think about Tetris you know

2218
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:42,420
know like I think about Tetris you know
 

2219
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,270
know like I think about Tetris you know
once once you get that full line of

00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,280
once once you get that full line of
 

2221
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,770
once once you get that full line of
blocks you can just throw that line of

2222
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:45,780
blocks you can just throw that line of
 

2223
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,790
blocks you can just throw that line of
blocks away and the whole video game

2224
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
blocks away and the whole video game
 

2225
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,589

moves down there's somehow something
 

2227
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,210
moves down there's somehow something
very similar going on here which is the

2228
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,220
very similar going on here which is the
 

2229
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,589
very similar going on here which is the
second I've managed to get a match for

2230
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:51,599
second I've managed to get a match for
 

2231
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,690
second I've managed to get a match for
line one of document into line one of

line one of document into line one of
 

2233
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,609
line one of document into line one of
the next document I'm just gonna like

2234
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:55,619
the next document I'm just gonna like
 

2235
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:56,950
the next document I'm just gonna like
throw it away

2236
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:56,960
throw it away
 

2237
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,510
throw it away
and pretend like I have two documents

2238
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
and pretend like I have two documents
 

2239
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,370
and pretend like I have two documents
with one less line in them

2240
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:01,380
with one less line in them
 

2241
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,109
with one less line in them
now the thing that got me all hung up

2242
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
now the thing that got me all hung up
 

2243
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,270
now the thing that got me all hung up
last night

2244
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,280
last night
 

2245
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,069
last night
my original problem assumes that both of

2246
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:07,079
my original problem assumes that both of
 

2247
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,470
my original problem assumes that both of
my documents have the same length

2248
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:09,480
my documents have the same length
 

2249
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,450
my documents have the same length
but here I'm not making that assumption

2250
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:11,460
but here I'm not making that assumption
 

2251
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,770
but here I'm not making that assumption
right

2252
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:12,780
right
 

2253
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,450
right
and essentially what we're going to

2254
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,460
and essentially what we're going to
 

2255
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,890
and essentially what we're going to
figure out is if that actually doesn't

2256
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:15,900
figure out is if that actually doesn't
 

2257
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,290
figure out is if that actually doesn't
matter a whole lot that if I end up with

2258
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:18,300
matter a whole lot that if I end up with
 

2259
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,870
matter a whole lot that if I end up with
one document of length K and well I

2260
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
one document of length K and well I
 

2261
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,730
one document of length K and well I
shouldn't use K one document of length L

2262
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:22,740
shouldn't use K one document of length L
 

2263
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,730
shouldn't use K one document of length L
and another document of like zero what's

2264
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:25,740
and another document of like zero what's
 

2265
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,349
and another document of like zero what's
the amount of work that I should do to

2266
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
the amount of work that I should do to
 

2267
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,030
the amount of work that I should do to
convert well

2268
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
convert well
 

2269
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,770
convert well
L right because my only choice is to

2270

insert a bunch of lines

2272
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,240
insert a bunch of lines
 

2273
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,530
insert a bunch of lines
in one document by the way or delete a

I'm philosophizing a lot because I'm

I'm philosophizing a lot because I'm
 

2281

I'm philosophizing a lot because I'm
also convincing myself that my answer is

00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,290
also convincing myself that my answer is
okay in the process

2284
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,300
okay in the process
 

2285
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,050
okay in the process
okay uh right so this is going to be our

2286
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,060
okay uh right so this is going to be our
 

2287
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,089
okay uh right so this is going to be our
set of sub problems and now we have to

2288
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:50,099
set of sub problems and now we have to
 

2289
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,230
set of sub problems and now we have to
do

2290
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:51,240
do
 

2291
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,430
do
um the uh the r right we have to relate

2292
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,440
um the uh the r right we have to relate
 

2293
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,890
um the uh the r right we have to relate
something we struggle with in the math

2294
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:57,900
something we struggle with in the math
 

2295
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,450
something we struggle with in the math
department sometimes

2296
00:42:59,450 --> 00:42:59,460
department sometimes
 

2297
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,910
department sometimes
um uh and essentially uh the way that I

2298
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:01,920
um uh and essentially uh the way that I
 

2299
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,490
um uh and essentially uh the way that I
went about this uh is to just do a

2300
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:04,500
went about this uh is to just do a
 

2301
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,349
went about this uh is to just do a
billion different cases of all the

2302
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:06,359
billion different cases of all the
 

2303
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:07,910
billion different cases of all the
possible edits that I could do to line I

2304
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
possible edits that I could do to line I
 

2305
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,890
possible edits that I could do to line I
and line J and that's perfectly fine in

2306
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:09,900
and line J and that's perfectly fine in
 

2307
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,569
and line J and that's perfectly fine in
this problem I think the problem is a

2308
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:11,579
this problem I think the problem is a
 

2309
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:13,069
this problem I think the problem is a
little slick and the way that they've

2310
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:13,079
little slick and the way that they've
 

2311
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,030
little slick and the way that they've
written the solution they've convinced

2312
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,040
written the solution they've convinced
 

2313
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,109
written the solution they've convinced
themselves that like some things are

2314
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
themselves that like some things are
 

2315
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,790
themselves that like some things are
equivalent to others and removed them

2316
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:16,800
equivalent to others and removed them
 

2317
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,050
equivalent to others and removed them
but you didn't have to as long as

2318
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,060
but you didn't have to as long as
 

2319
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,250
but you didn't have to as long as
there's a constant number of cases

2320
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:19,260
there's a constant number of cases
 

2321
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,130
there's a constant number of cases
you're you're golden

2322
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:21,140
you're you're golden
 

2323
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,349
you're you're golden
Ponyboy uh so in particular uh let's

2324
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:24,359
Ponyboy uh so in particular uh let's
 

2325
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,990
Ponyboy uh so in particular uh let's
think about some cases so first of all

2326
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,000
think about some cases so first of all
 

2327
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,849
think about some cases so first of all
if line I matches line J of my document

2328
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:31,859
if line I matches line J of my document
 

2329
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,589
if line I matches line J of my document
remember that it's not really line J

2330
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599
remember that it's not really line J
 

2331
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,510
remember that it's not really line J
it's like making a document that just

2332
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:35,520
it's like making a document that just
 

2333
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,670
it's like making a document that just
happens to kind of start at line J

2334
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
happens to kind of start at line J
 

2335
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,890
happens to kind of start at line J
right it's like taking scissors well

2336
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:39,900
right it's like taking scissors well
 

2337
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,510
right it's like taking scissors well
then I can match them with zero cost

2338
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
then I can match them with zero cost
 

2339
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,550
then I can match them with zero cost
right because the beginnings are in the

2340
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:43,560
right because the beginnings are in the
 

2341
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,569
right because the beginnings are in the
same place

2342
00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:44,579
same place
 

2343
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,370
same place
and I can move my Tetris game down one

2344
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:46,380
and I can move my Tetris game down one
 

2345
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,010
and I can move my Tetris game down one
and that's perfectly fine so uh right so

2346
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,020
and that's perfectly fine so uh right so
 

2347
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,390
and that's perfectly fine so uh right so
case one I think is the easiest one

2348
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
case one I think is the easiest one
 

2349
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,589
case one I think is the easiest one
which is if a i

2350
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:54,599
which is if a i
 

2351
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,510
which is if a i
equals B

2352
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:56,520
equals B
 

2353
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,650
equals B
J

2354
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:57,660
J
 

2355
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,450
J
right then I can just remove that line

2356
00:43:59,450 --> 00:43:59,460
right then I can just remove that line
 

2357
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,030
right then I can just remove that line
from both documents and move forward in

2358
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,040
from both documents and move forward in
 

2359
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,010
from both documents and move forward in
which case I'll use my same goofy

2360
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:04,020
which case I'll use my same goofy
 

2361
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,150
which case I'll use my same goofy
notation I'm going to get that x i j

2362
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
notation I'm going to get that x i j
 

2363
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,370
notation I'm going to get that x i j
well I'm going to just increment I and J

2364
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:10,380
well I'm going to just increment I and J
 

2365
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,089
well I'm going to just increment I and J
and keep going right

2366
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:14,099

 

2367
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,470

like that

2368
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:15,480
like that
 

2369
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,670
like that
cool

2370
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:16,680
cool
 

2371
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,829
cool
Okay so

2372
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:18,839
Okay so
 

2373
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,630
Okay so
what's something else I could do I could

2374
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:20,640
what's something else I could do I could
 

2375
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,950
what's something else I could do I could
delete a line

2376
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:21,960
delete a line
 

2377
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,250
delete a line
yeah so what happens uh

2378
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:28,260

 

2379
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,470

um so

2380
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:30,480
um so
 

2381
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,250
um so
case two is delete

2382
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:34,260

 

2383
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,890

a I right that's a different thing I

2384
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:36,900
a I right that's a different thing I
 

2385
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,450
a I right that's a different thing I
could do to line I

2386
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:38,460
could do to line I
 

2387
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,250
could do to line I
well now what do I have to do I have a

2388
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:40,260
well now what do I have to do I have a
 

2389
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,630
well now what do I have to do I have a
document on the left hand side which is

2390
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:41,640
document on the left hand side which is
 

2391
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,069
document on the left hand side which is
one line shorter and the right hand side

2392
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:43,079
one line shorter and the right hand side
 

2393
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,510
one line shorter and the right hand side
nothing changed

2394
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:44,520
nothing changed
 

2395
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,450
nothing changed
but deleting a line cost me a dollar

2396
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:47,460
but deleting a line cost me a dollar
 

2397
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,910
but deleting a line cost me a dollar
right so in particular I have that x i j

2398
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:52,920
right so in particular I have that x i j
 

2399
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,490
right so in particular I have that x i j
well what happens well I got rid of one

2400
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:55,500
well what happens well I got rid of one
 

2401
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,670
well what happens well I got rid of one
line

2402
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:58,680

 

2403
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,349

right

2404
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:00,359
right
 

2405
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,750
right
um but I had to pay

2406
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:02,760
um but I had to pay
 

2407
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,569
um but I had to pay
okay let's think about some other things

2408
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:05,579
okay let's think about some other things
 

2409
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:10,670
okay let's think about some other things
um you could delete BJ

2410
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:10,680

 

2411
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,349

this case actually isn't in the solution

2412
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:12,359
this case actually isn't in the solution
 

2413
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,809
this case actually isn't in the solution
because it turns out to be unnecessary

2414
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:14,819
because it turns out to be unnecessary
 

2415
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,550
because it turns out to be unnecessary
um

2416
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,560
um
 

2417
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,770
um
oh I'm only allowed to edit a oh in that

2418
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:18,780
oh I'm only allowed to edit a oh in that
 

2419
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,569
oh I'm only allowed to edit a oh in that
case I don't have to delete BJ I really

2420
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:20,579
case I don't have to delete BJ I really
 

2421
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:21,950
case I don't have to delete BJ I really
didn't read these problems very closely

2422
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:21,960
didn't read these problems very closely
 

2423
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,329
didn't read these problems very closely
that's my bad

2424
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:23,339
that's my bad
 

2425
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:24,890
that's my bad
this would have made it much easier I

2426
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:24,900
this would have made it much easier I
 

2427
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,290
this would have made it much easier I
really should read these things

2428
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:27,300
really should read these things
 

2429
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:27,950
really should read these things
um

2430
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:27,960
um
 

2431
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,750
um
cool so that like eliminates half of the

2432
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:29,760
cool so that like eliminates half of the
 

2433
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,910
cool so that like eliminates half of the
cases of my notes fabulous

2434
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
cases of my notes fabulous
 

2435
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,829
cases of my notes fabulous
incidentally you could

2436
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
incidentally you could
 

2437
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,270
incidentally you could
do these things on the other direction

2438
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
do these things on the other direction
 

2439
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,349
do these things on the other direction
and it really wouldn't change this

2440
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:36,359
and it really wouldn't change this
 

2441
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,150
and it really wouldn't change this
problem a whole lot

2442
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
problem a whole lot
 

2443
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,490
problem a whole lot
uh sorry you know I have this bad habit

2444
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:40,500
uh sorry you know I have this bad habit
 

2445
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,870
uh sorry you know I have this bad habit
like when I'm reading research papers of

2446
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:41,880
like when I'm reading research papers of
 

2447
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,309
like when I'm reading research papers of
like reading the research paper I wanted

2448
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:43,319
like reading the research paper I wanted
 

2449
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:44,809
like reading the research paper I wanted
to be there instead of the one that's

2450
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:44,819
to be there instead of the one that's
 

2451
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,210
to be there instead of the one that's
actually on the paper and somehow it's a

2452
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:47,220
actually on the paper and somehow it's a
 

2453
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,950
actually on the paper and somehow it's a
very similar phenomenon here

2454
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
very similar phenomenon here
 

2455
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,290
very similar phenomenon here
okay right so uh great so I can only

2456
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:51,300
okay right so uh great so I can only
 

2457
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,790
okay right so uh great so I can only
edit document a which means it's

2458
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
edit document a which means it's
 

2459
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,170
edit document a which means it's
probably way easier than what I was

2460
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:54,180
probably way easier than what I was
 

2461
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,470
probably way easier than what I was
worried about uh fabulous in that case

2462
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:57,480
worried about uh fabulous in that case
 

2463
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,410
worried about uh fabulous in that case
ah bananas

2464
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:00,420
ah bananas
 

2465
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,349
ah bananas
um what's our third case here well

2466
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:03,359
um what's our third case here well
 

2467
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,030
um what's our third case here well
um

2468
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,040
um
 

2469
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,609
um
let's see I could also insert

2470
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:07,619
let's see I could also insert
 

2471
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,290
let's see I could also insert
a line

2472
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:09,300
a line
 

2473
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,130
a line
um

2474
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:10,140
um
 

2475
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,870
um
let's see so what ends up happening

2476
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:11,880
let's see so what ends up happening
 

2477
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,170
let's see so what ends up happening
there so I can only edit document a H so

2478
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:15,180
there so I can only edit document a H so
 

2479
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,609
there so I can only edit document a H so
that makes my cases different than the

2480
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:16,619
that makes my cases different than the
 

2481
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,650
that makes my cases different than the
ones I wrote down on my notes

2482
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:18,660
ones I wrote down on my notes
 

2483
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:23,890
ones I wrote down on my notes
um

2484
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:23,900

 

2485
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:34,490

sorry okay so uh

2486
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:34,500

 

2487
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,290

um

2488
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:36,300
um
 

2489
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,990
um
okay so if I insert let's do this live

2490
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:39,000
okay so if I insert let's do this live
 

2491
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,210
okay so if I insert let's do this live
yeah okay so if I insert a line at line

2492
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:41,220
yeah okay so if I insert a line at line
 

2493
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,770
yeah okay so if I insert a line at line
I

2494
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:42,780
I
 

2495
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,230
I
I might as well make it match BJ there's

2496
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:45,240
I might as well make it match BJ there's
 

2497
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,630
I might as well make it match BJ there's
no reason not to right like I might as

2498
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:47,640
no reason not to right like I might as
 

2499
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,490
no reason not to right like I might as
well kill off one element of B while I'm

2500
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:49,500
well kill off one element of B while I'm
 

2501
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,069
well kill off one element of B while I'm
at it yeah so if I do that what ends up

2502
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:52,079
at it yeah so if I do that what ends up
 

2503
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,329
at it yeah so if I do that what ends up
happening

2504
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:53,339
happening
 

2505
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,550
happening
well I still have to match line I I've

2506
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:55,560
well I still have to match line I I've
 

2507
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,109
well I still have to match line I I've
just kind of moved it lower in my file

2508
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
just kind of moved it lower in my file
 

2509
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,829
just kind of moved it lower in my file
but I've in essence killed one line in

2510
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:00,839
but I've in essence killed one line in
 

2511
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,170
but I've in essence killed one line in
file B by making it match this new line

2512
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:03,180
file B by making it match this new line
 

2513
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,550
file B by making it match this new line
that I inserted

2514
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,560
that I inserted
 

2515
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,109
that I inserted
in my notes because I thought I could

2516
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:06,119
in my notes because I thought I could
 

2517
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,030
in my notes because I thought I could
edit B I said okay I can just delete the

2518
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:08,040
edit B I said okay I can just delete the
 

2519
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,589
edit B I said okay I can just delete the
line and b instead and somehow logically

2520
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:09,599
line and b instead and somehow logically
 

2521
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,970
line and b instead and somehow logically
that's all easier to think about but but

2522
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:10,980
that's all easier to think about but but
 

2523
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,770
that's all easier to think about but but
these are these are exactly dual to one

2524
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:12,780
these are these are exactly dual to one
 

2525
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,730
these are these are exactly dual to one
another

2526
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:13,740
another
 

2527
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,450
another
um so in that case I have x i j

2528
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:17,460
um so in that case I have x i j
 

2529
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,370
um so in that case I have x i j
well I still have to deal with AI I

2530
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:19,380
well I still have to deal with AI I
 

2531
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,990
well I still have to deal with AI I
haven't gotten rid of it but I've

2532
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:21,000
haven't gotten rid of it but I've
 

2533
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,829
haven't gotten rid of it but I've
matched line J so I paid one dollar for

2534
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:24,839
matched line J so I paid one dollar for
 

2535
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:27,710
matched line J so I paid one dollar for
uh inserting a line

2536
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:27,720
uh inserting a line
 

2537
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,870
uh inserting a line
and now I have

2538
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:29,880
and now I have
 

2539
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,250
and now I have
that because I've gotten rid of a line

2540
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:31,260
that because I've gotten rid of a line
 

2541
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,190
that because I've gotten rid of a line
in in the other file

2542
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:34,200
in in the other file
 

2543
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,690
in in the other file
if I stopped here by the way I would

2544
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:35,700
if I stopped here by the way I would
 

2545
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,849
if I stopped here by the way I would
have edit distance but

2546
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:37,859
have edit distance but
 

2547
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,290
have edit distance but
um unfortunately for me I have one

2548
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:39,300
um unfortunately for me I have one
 

2549
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,410
um unfortunately for me I have one
additional case which is

2550
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:42,420
additional case which is
 

2551
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,890
additional case which is
mild irritant as they say which is that

2552
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:45,900
mild irritant as they say which is that
 

2553
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,609
mild irritant as they say which is that
I can swap right

2554
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:49,619

 

2555
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,910

first of all can I always swap

2556
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:52,920
first of all can I always swap
 

2557
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,550
first of all can I always swap
I mean I can but if I swap two lines and

2558
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:55,560
I mean I can but if I swap two lines and
 

2559
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,690
I mean I can but if I swap two lines and
they still don't match the lines on the

2560
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:56,700
they still don't match the lines on the
 

2561
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,910
they still don't match the lines on the
right hand side I'm kind of hosed right

2562
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:58,920
right hand side I'm kind of hosed right
 

2563
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,170
right hand side I'm kind of hosed right
because I'm you can convince yourself

2564
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:00,180
because I'm you can convince yourself
 

2565
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,609
because I'm you can convince yourself
that in the next step I'm gonna have to

2566
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:01,619
that in the next step I'm gonna have to
 

2567
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,470
that in the next step I'm gonna have to
delete something anyway

2568
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:03,480
delete something anyway
 

2569
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,450
delete something anyway
swapping was free if I swap and delete

2570
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:05,460
swapping was free if I swap and delete
 

2571
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,069
swapping was free if I swap and delete
that's the same thing as just deleting

2572
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:07,079
that's the same thing as just deleting
 

2573
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:09,710
that's the same thing as just deleting
so it doesn't really matter so in

2574
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:09,720
so it doesn't really matter so in
 

2575
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,450
so it doesn't really matter so in
particular what that means is I might as

2576
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:11,460
particular what that means is I might as
 

2577
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,250
particular what that means is I might as
well only check the swap if it actually

2578
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:13,260
well only check the swap if it actually
 

2579
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,510
well only check the swap if it actually
helps me yeah so in other words

2580
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,520
helps me yeah so in other words
 

2581
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,650
helps me yeah so in other words
if I have a and I have to be a little

2582
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:21,660
if I have a and I have to be a little
 

2583
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,750
if I have a and I have to be a little
bit careful because I'm swapping so if

2584
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
bit careful because I'm swapping so if
 

2585
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,210
bit careful because I'm swapping so if
the next guy in a equals B

2586
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:26,220
the next guy in a equals B
 

2587
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,930
the next guy in a equals B
the current guy in B and the current guy

2588
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:29,940
the current guy in B and the current guy
 

2589
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,190
the current guy in B and the current guy
in a

2590
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
in a
 

2591
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,569
in a
equals the next guy in b

2592
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:35,579

 

2593
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,569

well now I can swap this guy and kill

2594
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:38,579
well now I can swap this guy and kill
 

2595
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:40,130
well now I can swap this guy and kill
off two lines of my files while I'm at

2596
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:40,140
off two lines of my files while I'm at
 

2597
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,030
off two lines of my files while I'm at
it right so in this case uh I get that x

2598
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:44,040
it right so in this case uh I get that x
 

2599
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,130
it right so in this case uh I get that x
i j

2600
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:46,140
i j
 

2601
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,690
i j
well swapping doesn't cost me anything

2602
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:47,700
well swapping doesn't cost me anything
 

2603
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:54,290
well swapping doesn't cost me anything
and I killed off two things so

2604
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:54,300

 

2605
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,470

that's the the the the recursive so if I

2606
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:57,480
that's the the the the recursive so if I
 

2607
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,550
that's the the the the recursive so if I
were to write this out on my homework

2608
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:58,560
were to write this out on my homework
 

2609
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,589
were to write this out on my homework
what should I do well I shouldn't I mean

2610
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:00,599
what should I do well I shouldn't I mean
 

2611
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,089
what should I do well I shouldn't I mean
probably if you use this arrow notation

2612
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:02,099
probably if you use this arrow notation
 

2613
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:03,290
probably if you use this arrow notation
I don't think it would be a big deal but

2614
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:03,300
I don't think it would be a big deal but
 

2615
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,790
I don't think it would be a big deal but
but really you should should add a line

2616
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:04,800
but really you should should add a line
 

2617
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,890
but really you should should add a line
at the bottom saying that you know I can

2618
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:06,900
at the bottom saying that you know I can
 

2619
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,329
at the bottom saying that you know I can
choose to do any of these things so

2620
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:08,339
choose to do any of these things so
 

2621
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:11,150
choose to do any of these things so
really my recursive call is x i j gets

2622
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:11,160
really my recursive call is x i j gets
 

2623
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,750
really my recursive call is x i j gets
the Min of all of these uh one two three

2624
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:14,760
the Min of all of these uh one two three
 

2625
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,150
the Min of all of these uh one two three
four Expressions that I've written here

2626
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:17,160
four Expressions that I've written here
 

2627
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,069
four Expressions that I've written here
okay

2628
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:22,079

 

2629
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,870

what if I have the first condition but

2630
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:23,880
what if I have the first condition but
 

2631
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,290
what if I have the first condition but
not the second one ah so

2632
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:27,300
not the second one ah so
 

2633
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,569
not the second one ah so
that's a great question yeah so the

2634
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:29,579
that's a great question yeah so the
 

2635
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:31,130
that's a great question yeah so the
question was like okay well what if I

2636
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,140
question was like okay well what if I
 

2637
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,069
question was like okay well what if I
you know I can match the next line but

2638
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:34,079
you know I can match the next line but
 

2639
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,290
you know I can match the next line but
not the current one

2640
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:36,300
not the current one
 

2641
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,490
not the current one
well there's two different things you

2642
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:37,500
well there's two different things you
 

2643
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,450
well there's two different things you
could do you could either make another

2644
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:38,460
could do you could either make another
 

2645
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,710
could do you could either make another
case for that that's perfectly fine

2646
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:39,720
case for that that's perfectly fine
 

2647
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,809
case for that that's perfectly fine
right in fact you could do that you

2648
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:41,819
right in fact you could do that you
 

2649
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:42,950
right in fact you could do that you
could do you know that I matched the

2650
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
could do you know that I matched the
 

2651
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,270
could do you know that I matched the
second condition not the first one like

2652
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:44,280
second condition not the first one like
 

2653
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,890
second condition not the first one like
whatever you can just enumerate as many

2654
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:45,900
whatever you can just enumerate as many
 

2655
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,030
whatever you can just enumerate as many
things you want it all through and

2656
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,040
things you want it all through and
 

2657
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,650
things you want it all through and
there's a constant number

2658
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:48,660
there's a constant number
 

2659
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,270
there's a constant number
um alternatively you convince yourself

2660
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:50,280
um alternatively you convince yourself
 

2661
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,890
um alternatively you convince yourself
that that actually is unnecessary here

2662
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:51,900
that that actually is unnecessary here
 

2663
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,050
that that actually is unnecessary here
because a different so that's like

2664
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:54,060
because a different so that's like
 

2665
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,730
because a different so that's like
swapping

2666
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:55,740
swapping
 

2667
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,710
swapping
but then one of those two lines is still

2668
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:57,720
but then one of those two lines is still
 

2669
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,790
but then one of those two lines is still
a mismatch so you're going to have to

2670
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:58,800
a mismatch so you're going to have to
 

2671
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,710
a mismatch so you're going to have to
delete something in the next step

2672
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:00,720
delete something in the next step
 

2673
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,390
delete something in the next step
so you might as well just delete first

2674
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:02,400
so you might as well just delete first
 

2675
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,809
so you might as well just delete first
rather than than Swap and then delete uh

2676
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:05,819
rather than than Swap and then delete uh
 

2677
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,250
rather than than Swap and then delete uh
and and so that's why that case isn't

2678
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:07,260
and and so that's why that case isn't
 

2679
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,210
and and so that's why that case isn't
isn't necessary yeah exactly

2680
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:11,220
isn't necessary yeah exactly
 

2681
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,130
isn't necessary yeah exactly
exactly so if you swapped and you killed

2682
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:13,140
exactly so if you swapped and you killed
 

2683
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,450
exactly so if you swapped and you killed
a line then in effect I think it's a

2684
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:14,460
a line then in effect I think it's a
 

2685
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,890
a line then in effect I think it's a
combination of case one and case two

2686
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:15,900
combination of case one and case two
 

2687
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,849
combination of case one and case two
here

2688
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:16,859
here
 

2689
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:18,829
here
if you kind of expand your recursion now

2690
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:18,839
if you kind of expand your recursion now
 

2691
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,450
if you kind of expand your recursion now
but if you're having trouble convincing

2692
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:20,460
but if you're having trouble convincing
 

2693
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,490
but if you're having trouble convincing
yourself of that that's fine just add a

2694
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:22,500
yourself of that that's fine just add a
 

2695
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,130
yourself of that that's fine just add a
case here yeah

2696
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:25,140
case here yeah
 

2697
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,569
case here yeah
any other questions I'm going to ask

2698
00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:26,579
any other questions I'm going to ask
 

2699
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:28,250
any other questions I'm going to ask
quickly because I this problem makes me

2700
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:28,260
quickly because I this problem makes me
 

2701
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,809
quickly because I this problem makes me
nervous

2702
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:32,819

 

2703
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:34,730

sure yeah okay in the worst case if if

2704
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:34,740
sure yeah okay in the worst case if if
 

2705
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,809
sure yeah okay in the worst case if if
we've done something wrong you can

2706
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:35,819
we've done something wrong you can
 

2707
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,849
we've done something wrong you can
certainly add another case here

2708
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:37,859
certainly add another case here
 

2709
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:38,990
certainly add another case here
um

2710
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,000
um
 

2711
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,670
um
I'll think about it at home

2712
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:40,680
I'll think about it at home
 

2713
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,130
I'll think about it at home
okay so uh since I've managed to

2714
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:43,140
okay so uh since I've managed to
 

2715
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,630
okay so uh since I've managed to
pontificate too long let's let's keep

2716
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:44,640
pontificate too long let's let's keep
 

2717
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,950
pontificate too long let's let's keep
moving here

2718
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:47,960

 

2719
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,270

oh yeah the problem is it might have

2720
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:50,280
oh yeah the problem is it might have
 

2721
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,220
oh yeah the problem is it might have
been used

2722
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:52,230
been used
 

2723
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,750
been used
[Applause]

2724
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:55,760

 

2725
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,950

and that's

2726
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:57,960
and that's
 

2727
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,349
and that's
not okay yeah because at the end of the

2728
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:00,359
not okay yeah because at the end of the
 

2729
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,510
not okay yeah because at the end of the
day the the files have to agree like you

2730
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:02,520
day the the files have to agree like you
 

2731
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,329
day the the files have to agree like you
have to match B to a

2732
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:05,339
have to match B to a
 

2733
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:06,530
have to match B to a
wow

2734
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:06,540
wow
 

2735
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,109
wow
to the leads into inserts no no but the

2736
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
to the leads into inserts no no but the
 

2737
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,390
to the leads into inserts no no but the
the Swap and delete is illegal because

2738
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:11,400
the Swap and delete is illegal because
 

2739
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,309
the Swap and delete is illegal because
you have to use both lines that's a

2740
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:13,319
you have to use both lines that's a
 

2741
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:14,990
you have to use both lines that's a
condition in the pocket oh I'm sorry

2742
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:15,000
condition in the pocket oh I'm sorry
 

2743
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,730
condition in the pocket oh I'm sorry
that's a better answer um so Jason

2744
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:16,740
that's a better answer um so Jason
 

2745
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,349
that's a better answer um so Jason
points out that if I swap thing I can't

2746
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:18,359
points out that if I swap thing I can't
 

2747
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:19,609
points out that if I swap thing I can't
delete it

2748
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:19,619
delete it
 

2749
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:20,750
delete it
um because the way the problem is

2750
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:20,760
um because the way the problem is
 

2751
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,790
um because the way the problem is
written so that effectively removes this

2752
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
written so that effectively removes this
 

2753
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,390
written so that effectively removes this
case otherwise I think I guess Eric is

2754
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,400
case otherwise I think I guess Eric is
 

2755
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,609
case otherwise I think I guess Eric is
oh sorry I've managed to totally botch

2756
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:28,619
oh sorry I've managed to totally botch
 

2757
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,950
oh sorry I've managed to totally botch
this which is totally unsurprising

2758
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:30,960
this which is totally unsurprising
 

2759
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,930
this which is totally unsurprising
um yeah so so I think the problem also

2760
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:32,940
um yeah so so I think the problem also
 

2761
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,150
um yeah so so I think the problem also
states that like if you swap the swap

2762
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:35,160
states that like if you swap the swap
 

2763
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,490
states that like if you swap the swap
has to be useful

2764
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:37,500
has to be useful
 

2765
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,170
has to be useful
um and that's why this this additional

2766
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:39,180
um and that's why this this additional
 

2767
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,970
um and that's why this this additional
case that Eric is asking about where you

2768
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:40,980
case that Eric is asking about where you
 

2769
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,730
case that Eric is asking about where you
swap and then you match one line but not

2770
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:43,740
swap and then you match one line but not
 

2771
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,530
swap and then you match one line but not
the other is unnecessary

2772
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:45,540
the other is unnecessary
 

2773
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,569
the other is unnecessary
you might be able to relax that by just

2774
00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:47,579
you might be able to relax that by just
 

2775
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,069
you might be able to relax that by just
adding a case here but since the problem

2776
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:49,079
adding a case here but since the problem
 

2777
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:50,210
adding a case here but since the problem
doesn't ask it I'm not gonna think about

2778
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:50,220
doesn't ask it I'm not gonna think about
 

2779
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:50,870
doesn't ask it I'm not gonna think about
it

2780
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:50,880
it
 

2781
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,849
it
okay right

2782
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:52,859
okay right
 

2783
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,530
okay right
so under all the assumptions this

2784
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:54,540
so under all the assumptions this
 

2785
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,970
so under all the assumptions this
problem that I didn't read but are very

2786
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:55,980
problem that I didn't read but are very
 

2787
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,049
problem that I didn't read but are very
important to solving this problem

2788
00:51:57,049 --> 00:51:57,059
important to solving this problem
 

2789
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,990
important to solving this problem
correctly uh uh I believe we really have

2790
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:00,000
correctly uh uh I believe we really have
 

2791
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,069
correctly uh uh I believe we really have
uh uh written down all of our cases here

2792
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
uh uh written down all of our cases here
 

2793
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,750
uh uh written down all of our cases here
um okay so let's let's continue with our

2794
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:05,760
um okay so let's let's continue with our
 

2795
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,910
um okay so let's let's continue with our
sort bot uh

2796
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:07,920
sort bot uh
 

2797
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,790
sort bot uh
Paradigm so now we have all of our our

2798
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:10,800
Paradigm so now we have all of our our
 

2799
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,349
Paradigm so now we have all of our our
recursion

2800
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:12,359

2801
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,329

the topological order here is a little

2802
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:14,339
the topological order here is a little
 

2803
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,230
the topological order here is a little
bit

2804
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:15,240
bit
 

2805
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,450
bit
trickier than normal right because now

2806
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:17,460
trickier than normal right because now
 

2807
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,549
trickier than normal right because now
you've got a two-dimensional array but

2808
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:19,559
you've got a two-dimensional array but
 

2809
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,170
you've got a two-dimensional array but
it follows a pattern uh that's pretty

2810
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:21,180
it follows a pattern uh that's pretty
 

2811
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:26,930
it follows a pattern uh that's pretty
typical here which is that x i j only

2812
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:26,940
typical here which is that x i j only
 

2813
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,510
typical here which is that x i j only
uh depends

2814
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,520
uh depends
 

2815
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:35,990
uh depends
um on on other xijs with higher

00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,000

 

2817
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,170

I plus J right so I think about my graph

2818
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:39,180
I plus J right so I think about my graph
 

2819
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,569

um which is what's making it uh acyclic

2826
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:47,880

2827
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,730
um which is what's making it uh acyclic
it's a very typical pattern in these

all right so let's see here sort bot so

2834
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:55,619
all right so let's see here sort bot so
 

2835
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:57,770
all right so let's see here sort bot so
we need our base case

2836
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:57,780
we need our base case
 

2837
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,329
we need our base case
uh this isn't too bad because

2838
00:52:59,329 --> 00:52:59,339
uh this isn't too bad because
 

2839
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,490
uh this isn't too bad because
essentially when you have boring

2840
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:01,500
essentially when you have boring
 

2841
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,069
essentially when you have boring

matching to document I well
 

2855
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,630
matching to document I well
how much work do I have to do

2856
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
how much work do I have to do
 

2857
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,950
how much work do I have to do
it'd be a little bit careful this is

2858
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:21,960
it'd be a little bit careful this is
 

2859
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,510
it'd be a little bit careful this is
where the the suffix version of this

2860
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:23,520
where the the suffix version of this
 

2861
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,650
where the the suffix version of this
problem is a little bit more annoying

2862
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:24,660
problem is a little bit more annoying
 

2863
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,510
problem is a little bit more annoying
than the prefix one or if I managed to

2864
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:26,520
than the prefix one or if I managed to
 

2865
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,549
than the prefix one or if I managed to
swap those backward again

2866
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,559
swap those backward again
 

2867
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,069
swap those backward again
um that in particular the remaining

2868
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:31,079
um that in particular the remaining
 

2869
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,910
um that in particular the remaining
number of lines looks like n plus 1

2870
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:34,920
number of lines looks like n plus 1
 

2871
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,370
number of lines looks like n plus 1
minus I right

2872
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:37,380
minus I right
 

2873
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,410
minus I right
um which is different than like in the

2874
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:39,420
um which is different than like in the
 

2875
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,490
um which is different than like in the
problem is just I because they're

2876
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:40,500
problem is just I because they're
 

2877
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,349
problem is just I because they're
working in the other direction in the

2878
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:42,359
working in the other direction in the
 

2879
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,049
working in the other direction in the
solution rather and similarly you need a

2880
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:45,059
solution rather and similarly you need a
 

2881
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,970
solution rather and similarly you need a
second case for those two here right so

2882
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:46,980
second case for those two here right so
 

2883
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,549
second case for those two here right so
you have X

2884
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:49,559
you have X
 

2885
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:55,130
you have X
n plus 1 J is going to be

2886
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:55,140
n plus 1 J is going to be
 

2887
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,549
n plus 1 J is going to be
n plus one minus J

2888
00:53:58,549 --> 00:53:58,559

 

2889
00:53:58,559 --> 00:53:59,630

cool

2890
00:53:59,630 --> 00:53:59,640
cool
 

2891
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,069
cool
okay

2892
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:01,079
okay
 

2893
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,410
okay
so we're going to continue with sort bot

2894
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:03,420
so we're going to continue with sort bot
 

2895
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,750
so we're going to continue with sort bot
here

2896
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:05,760

 

2897
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,309

um right so what is our original case

2898
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:07,319
um right so what is our original case
 

2899
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:10,069
um right so what is our original case
kind of by definition uh

2900
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
kind of by definition uh
 

2901
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,030
kind of by definition uh
is is X one one or zero zero depending

2902
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:14,040
is is X one one or zero zero depending
 

2903
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,690
is is X one one or zero zero depending
on how you index and then finally

2904
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:17,700
on how you index and then finally
 

2905
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,230
on how you index and then finally
what's our run time well uh let's see

2906
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:21,240
what's our run time well uh let's see
 

2907
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,230
what's our run time well uh let's see
there's n plus one

2908
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,240
there's n plus one
 

2909
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,109
there's n plus one
squared sub problems

2910
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:27,119
squared sub problems
 

2911
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,870
squared sub problems
and of course that's equal to order n

2912
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:29,880
and of course that's equal to order n
 

2913
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,329
and of course that's equal to order n
squared the sub problems are just a

2914
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:32,339
squared the sub problems are just a
 

2915
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:33,950
squared the sub problems are just a
constant amount of work

2916
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:33,960
constant amount of work
 

2917
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,069
constant amount of work
so they're each

2918
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:37,079
so they're each
 

2919
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:41,569
so they're each
with constant work

2920
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:41,579

 

2921
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:46,130

so our entire runtime is order N squared

2922
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:46,140
so our entire runtime is order N squared
 

2923
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,750
so our entire runtime is order N squared
and hopefully

2924
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:47,760
and hopefully
 

2925
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,849
and hopefully
by watching me be confused in front of

2926
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:49,859
by watching me be confused in front of
 

2927
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:51,410
by watching me be confused in front of
you and think through this problem you

2928
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:51,420
you and think through this problem you
 

2929
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,690
you and think through this problem you
too will see how the problem solving you

2930
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:53,700
too will see how the problem solving you
 

2931
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,270
too will see how the problem solving you
know procedure can happen in your own

2932
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:56,280
know procedure can happen in your own
 

2933
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,950
know procedure can happen in your own
disorganized brains

2934
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:57,960
disorganized brains
 

2935
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,349
disorganized brains
okay so that concludes our our sort of

2936
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:00,359
okay so that concludes our our sort of
 

2937
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:03,770
okay so that concludes our our sort of
treatment of this this problem here

2938
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:03,780

 

2939
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,270

that I think is the hardest one so so

2940
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
that I think is the hardest one so so
 

2941
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,950
that I think is the hardest one so so
the other two thankfully are are much

2942
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:06,960
the other two thankfully are are much
 

2943
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,750
the other two thankfully are are much
easier to to think about

2944
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:08,760
easier to to think about
 

2945
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,370
easier to to think about
I thought

2946
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:10,380
I thought
 

2947
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,809
I thought
um but I never liked at a distance I

2948
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:11,819
um but I never liked at a distance I
 

2949
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:12,770
um but I never liked at a distance I
remember seeing that in undergrad

2950
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:12,780
remember seeing that in undergrad
 

2951
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,569
remember seeing that in undergrad
algorithms getting confused

2952
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:14,579
algorithms getting confused
 

2953
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:17,510
algorithms getting confused
okay so uh the next problem uh problem

2954
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:17,520
okay so uh the next problem uh problem
 

2955
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,130
okay so uh the next problem uh problem
three here

2956
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:19,140
three here
 

2957
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,329
three here
uh deals with saggy mimson uh and she

2958
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:23,339
uh deals with saggy mimson uh and she
 

2959
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:25,010
uh deals with saggy mimson uh and she
has a bunch of blocks

2960
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:25,020
has a bunch of blocks
 

2961
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,270
has a bunch of blocks
and she wants to stack them on top of

2962
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:26,280
and she wants to stack them on top of
 

2963
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,049
and she wants to stack them on top of
each other

2964
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:27,059
each other
 

2965
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,710
each other
that's what it does and as a young

2966
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
that's what it does and as a young
 

2967
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,650
that's what it does and as a young
structural engineer she has a few

2968
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:32,660
structural engineer she has a few
 

2969
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:37,609
structural engineer she has a few
criteria on her problem

2970
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:37,619

 

2971
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,890

let me go to the right page in my notes

2972
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:39,900
let me go to the right page in my notes
 

2973
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,089
let me go to the right page in my notes
Here

2974
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:44,099

 

2975
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:45,109

right

2976
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,119
right
 

2977
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,710
right
so uh so this is problem three uh so we

2978
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
so uh so this is problem three uh so we
 

2979
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,589
so uh so this is problem three uh so we
have the Block B

2980
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:51,599
have the Block B
 

2981
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,049
have the Block B
um

2982
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:54,059

 

2983
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,609

I uh has size that looks like with w i

2984
00:55:58,609 --> 00:55:58,619
I uh has size that looks like with w i
 

2985
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:00,410
I uh has size that looks like with w i
by

2986
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:00,420
by
 

2987
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,130
by

height h i by length l i
 

2989
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,510
height h i by length l i
I remember getting confused in

2990
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
I remember getting confused in
 

2991
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,770
I remember getting confused in
elementary school about the difference

2992
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:06,780
elementary school about the difference
 

2993
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,750
elementary school about the difference
between width and length all the time to

2994
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:08,760
between width and length all the time to
 

2995
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,609
between width and length all the time to
me those always sounded the same but it

2996
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:10,619
me those always sounded the same but it
 

2997
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:11,630
me those always sounded the same but it
doesn't really matter because she's

2998
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:11,640
doesn't really matter because she's
 

2999
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,329
doesn't really matter because she's
happy to rotate her cubes anyway that

3000
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:14,339
happy to rotate her cubes anyway that
 

3001
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:16,309
happy to rotate her cubes anyway that
that she pleases

3002
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:16,319
that she pleases
 

3003
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,290
that she pleases
uh there's a key detail which I did

3004
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:18,300
uh there's a key detail which I did
 

3005
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,089
uh there's a key detail which I did
remember uh to actually read in this

3006
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:20,099
remember uh to actually read in this
 

3007
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,849
remember uh to actually read in this
problem uh which is that she has at

3008
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:22,859
problem uh which is that she has at
 

3009
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:23,630
problem uh which is that she has at
least

3010
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:23,640
least
 

3011
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,150
least
three of

3012
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
three of
 

3013
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,390
three of
each type

3014
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:29,400

 

3015
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,829

um where type here means that I can I

3016
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:30,839
um where type here means that I can I
 

3017
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:32,569
um where type here means that I can I
can permute these three numbers any way

3018
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:32,579
can permute these three numbers any way
 

3019
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:33,650
can permute these three numbers any way
that I want because that's the same as

3020
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:33,660
that I want because that's the same as
 

3021
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,150
that I want because that's the same as
this rotating a block

3022
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:35,160
this rotating a block
 

3023
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,829
this rotating a block
but anytime she has one block that's

3024
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:36,839
but anytime she has one block that's
 

3025
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,809
but anytime she has one block that's
like one by two by three she has at

3026
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:38,819
like one by two by three she has at
 

3027
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:41,089
like one by two by three she has at
least two two more in her bag somewhere

3028
00:56:41,089 --> 00:56:41,099
least two two more in her bag somewhere
 

3029
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:42,290
least two two more in her bag somewhere
okay

3030
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:42,300
okay
 

3031
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,150
okay
um

3032
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
um
 

3033
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,430
um
oh one times two times three is equal to

3034
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:46,440
oh one times two times three is equal to
 

3035
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,710
oh one times two times three is equal to
six thank you Apple watch

3036
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:48,720
six thank you Apple watch
 

3037
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,370
six thank you Apple watch
okay so uh that's odd so she can Orient

3038
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:52,380
okay so uh that's odd so she can Orient
 

3039
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,750
okay so uh that's odd so she can Orient
her block any way that she wants meaning

3040
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,760
her block any way that she wants meaning
 

3041
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,609
her block any way that she wants meaning
she can rotate it

3042
00:56:55,609 --> 00:56:55,619
she can rotate it
 

3043
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:58,190
she can rotate it
um uh and any any in any fashion that

3044
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:58,200
um uh and any any in any fashion that
 

3045
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,089
um uh and any any in any fashion that
you'd like

3046
00:56:59,089 --> 00:56:59,099
you'd like
 

3047
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:01,490
you'd like
and so what we're trying to do what we

3048
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:01,500
and so what we're trying to do what we
 

3049
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,809
and so what we're trying to do what we
want

3050
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:02,819
want
 

3051
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,069
want
is

3052
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
is
 

3053
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,730
is
the max height

3054
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:07,740

 

3055
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,829

um where she's stacking uh her end

3056
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:09,839
um where she's stacking uh her end
 

3057
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,010
um where she's stacking uh her end
blocks I suppose I should say there and

3058
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:13,020
blocks I suppose I should say there and
 

3059
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,809
blocks I suppose I should say there and
blocks

3060
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:14,819
blocks
 

3061
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:17,270
blocks
uh so she wants the max height that she

3062
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,280
uh so she wants the max height that she
 

3063
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,250
uh so she wants the max height that she
can achieve but just to be kind of

3064
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:19,260
can achieve but just to be kind of
 

3065
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,230
can achieve but just to be kind of
annoying

3066
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:21,240
annoying
 

3067
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,270
annoying
um or because again she's very concerned

3068
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
um or because again she's very concerned
 

3069
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,710
um or because again she's very concerned
with structural stability she lives in

3070
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:24,720
with structural stability she lives in
 

3071
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,530
with structural stability she lives in
an earthquake zone she would like uh

3072
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:27,540
an earthquake zone she would like uh
 

3073
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,750
an earthquake zone she would like uh
with the condition

3074
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:29,760
with the condition
 

3075
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,150
with the condition
um that each block is strictly supported

3076
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160
um that each block is strictly supported
 

3077
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,970
um that each block is strictly supported
uh on the Block beneath that right

3078
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:34,980
uh on the Block beneath that right
 

3079
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:40,309
uh on the Block beneath that right
um

3080
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:40,319

 

3081
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,589

so in other words like if this is the

3082
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:42,599
so in other words like if this is the
 

3083
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,370
so in other words like if this is the
base

3084
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:43,380
base
 

3085
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,710
base
of one block then the next block that's

3086
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:45,720
of one block then the next block that's
 

3087
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,710
of one block then the next block that's
stacked on top of it has to be strictly

3088
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
stacked on top of it has to be strictly
 

3089
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,890
stacked on top of it has to be strictly
contained within the block below it

3090
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:51,900
contained within the block below it
 

3091
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,970
contained within the block below it
right

3092
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:52,980
right
 

3093
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,010
right
so the problem makes sense have I

3094
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:55,020
so the problem makes sense have I
 

3095
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,230
so the problem makes sense have I
omitted any critical details I don't

3096
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:57,240
omitted any critical details I don't
 

3097
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,370
omitted any critical details I don't
think I have this time this one's a

3098
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:58,380
think I have this time this one's a
 

3099
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,970
think I have this time this one's a
little easier

3100
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:01,980

 

3101
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,589

oh yeah so and she can't do anything

3102
00:58:03,589 --> 00:58:03,599
oh yeah so and she can't do anything
 

3103
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,930
oh yeah so and she can't do anything
crazy she can't like do like a weird you

3104
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:05,940
crazy she can't like do like a weird you
 

3105
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,549
crazy she can't like do like a weird you
know like balance it on its Edge kind of

3106
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:07,559
know like balance it on its Edge kind of
 

3107
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,390
know like balance it on its Edge kind of
thing

3108
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
thing
 

3109
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,130
thing
um which is Eric is absolutely right it

3110
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:10,140
um which is Eric is absolutely right it
 

3111
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,470
um which is Eric is absolutely right it
could actually give her a taller uh

3112
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
could actually give her a taller uh
 

3113
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,569
could actually give her a taller uh
Tower than you could get if you're only

3114
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:14,579
Tower than you could get if you're only
 

3115
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:16,490
Tower than you could get if you're only
allowed to rotate blocks 90 degrees I

3116
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:16,500
allowed to rotate blocks 90 degrees I
 

3117
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,809
allowed to rotate blocks 90 degrees I
don't think the problem states that

3118
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:17,819
don't think the problem states that
 

3119
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:19,910
don't think the problem states that
explicitly but this isn't a trigonometry

3120
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
explicitly but this isn't a trigonometry
 

3121
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,770
explicitly but this isn't a trigonometry
class so I think we're in good shape

3122
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:21,780
class so I think we're in good shape
 

3123
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,630
class so I think we're in good shape
okay

3124
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:23,640
okay
 

3125
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,970
okay
um right so so that's our our basic

3126
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:25,980
um right so so that's our our basic
 

3127
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,349
um right so so that's our our basic
problem here

3128
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:27,359
problem here
 

3129
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,970
problem here
this is one of these problems that like

3130
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:28,980
this is one of these problems that like
 

3131
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,410
this is one of these problems that like
it's going to be a dynamic programming

3132
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:30,420
it's going to be a dynamic programming
 

3133
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,870
it's going to be a dynamic programming
problem but again similar to many of the

3134
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:32,880
problem but again similar to many of the
 

3135
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,250
problem but again similar to many of the
things that we saw in lecture it's not

3136
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:34,260
things that we saw in lecture it's not
 

3137
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,230
things that we saw in lecture it's not
totally obvious how right because

3138
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:36,240
totally obvious how right because
 

3139
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,230
totally obvious how right because
somehow she has this big disorganized

3140
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:39,240
somehow she has this big disorganized
 

3141
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,450
somehow she has this big disorganized
bag of blocks you could imagine a

3142
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:41,460
bag of blocks you could imagine a
 

3143
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,670
bag of blocks you could imagine a
universe where there's two to the n

3144
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,680
universe where there's two to the n
 

3145
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,289
universe where there's two to the n
different things she could do right she

3146
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:45,299
different things she could do right she
 

3147
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:46,670
different things she could do right she
could for every single block she could

3148
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:46,680
could for every single block she could
 

3149
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,950
could for every single block she could
decide whether or not to put it in her

3150
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:48,960
decide whether or not to put it in her
 

3151
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,329
decide whether or not to put it in her
stack and then she has to do a bunch of

3152
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:50,339
stack and then she has to do a bunch of
 

3153
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,190
stack and then she has to do a bunch of
other work to verify whether she can

3154
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:52,200
other work to verify whether she can
 

3155
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,109
other work to verify whether she can
stack them while supporting the strict

3156
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:54,119
stack them while supporting the strict
 

3157
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:56,210
stack them while supporting the strict
support condition or not

3158
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:56,220
support condition or not
 

3159
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,730
support condition or not
so initially that seems kind of annoying

3160
00:58:58,730 --> 00:58:58,740
so initially that seems kind of annoying
 

3161
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,549
so initially that seems kind of annoying
so what we have to do which again is is

3162
00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:01,559
so what we have to do which again is is
 

3163
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:02,990
so what we have to do which again is is
pretty common to a lot of these problems

3164
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:03,000
pretty common to a lot of these problems
 

3165
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,049
pretty common to a lot of these problems
is is Place some order on it I mean that

3166
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:06,059
is is Place some order on it I mean that
 

3167
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:07,849
is is Place some order on it I mean that
both in the entropy sense and also like

3168
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:07,859
both in the entropy sense and also like
 

3169
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:09,890
both in the entropy sense and also like
literally we're going to order stuff

3170
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:09,900
literally we're going to order stuff
 

3171
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,990
literally we're going to order stuff
um and and in particular uh we'll see

3172
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
um and and in particular uh we'll see
 

3173
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,250
um and and in particular uh we'll see
that this problem has a lot in common

3174
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,260
that this problem has a lot in common
 

3175
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,410
that this problem has a lot in common
with that longest common subsequence

3176
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:15,420
with that longest common subsequence
 

3177
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,970
with that longest common subsequence
problem that we saw in lecture

3178
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:16,980
problem that we saw in lecture
 

3179
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,390
problem that we saw in lecture
increasing subsequent sorry

3180
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:20,400
increasing subsequent sorry
 

3181
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,710
increasing subsequent sorry
um right

3182
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:21,720
um right
 

3183
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,970
um right
so here's some some observations

3184
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:25,980
so here's some some observations
 

3185
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,349
so here's some some observations
about our problem which are going to

3186
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
about our problem which are going to
 

3187
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,130
about our problem which are going to
help

3188
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:28,140
help
 

3189
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,770
help
um first of all

3190
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:30,780
um first of all
 

3191
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,170
um first of all
when we stack our blocks

3192
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:33,180
when we stack our blocks
 

3193
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,510
when we stack our blocks
we might as well always align the

3194
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:35,520
we might as well always align the
 

3195
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,910
we might as well always align the
shorter side of the block on top to the

3196
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
shorter side of the block on top to the
 

3197
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,609
shorter side of the block on top to the
shorter side of the block underneath it

3198
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:40,619
shorter side of the block underneath it
 

3199
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,809
shorter side of the block underneath it
right

3200
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:41,819
right
 

3201
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:43,910
right
um

3202
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:43,920

 

3203
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,690

let me draw a picture of what I mean

3204
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:50,700

 

3205
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,569

so let's say I have a really block whose

3206
00:59:53,569 --> 00:59:53,579
so let's say I have a really block whose
 

3207
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,190
so let's say I have a really block whose
base kind of looks like that and then

3208
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,200
base kind of looks like that and then
 

3209
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,130
base kind of looks like that and then
another block which is also rectangular

3210
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:58,140
another block which is also rectangular
 

3211
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,370
another block which is also rectangular
that I sit on top of it like that

3212
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:01,380
that I sit on top of it like that
 

3213
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,130
that I sit on top of it like that
then notice I could so in this case the

3214
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:04,140
then notice I could so in this case the
 

3215
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,170
then notice I could so in this case the
shorter edge of one block is aligned to

3216
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:06,180
shorter edge of one block is aligned to
 

3217
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,430
shorter edge of one block is aligned to
the longer edge of the other notice I

3218
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:07,440
the longer edge of the other notice I
 

3219
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,069
the longer edge of the other notice I
can rotate it 90 degrees and it still

3220
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:10,079
can rotate it 90 degrees and it still
 

3221
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,230
can rotate it 90 degrees and it still
supports on on one another so there's

3222
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:12,240
supports on on one another so there's
 

3223
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,089
supports on on one another so there's
never a case you convince yourself with

3224
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:14,099
never a case you convince yourself with
 

3225
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,069
never a case you convince yourself with
just a few inequalities

3226
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
just a few inequalities
 

3227
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,809
just a few inequalities
um where I don't kind of always put the

3228
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:17,819
um where I don't kind of always put the
 

3229
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,370
um where I don't kind of always put the
long side parallel to the long side of

3230
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:19,380
long side parallel to the long side of
 

3231
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,049
long side parallel to the long side of
the guy underneath it and the short side

3232
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:21,059
the guy underneath it and the short side
 

3233
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,849
the guy underneath it and the short side
parallel to the short guy underneath it

3234
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:22,859
parallel to the short guy underneath it
 

3235
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:24,650
parallel to the short guy underneath it
that makes sense

3236
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:24,660
that makes sense
 

3237
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:29,930
that makes sense
cool so that's observation one

3238
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:29,940

 

3239
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:32,210

observation two

3240
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:32,220
observation two
 

3241
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,309
observation two
can I ever like let's say that Maggie

3242
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
can I ever like let's say that Maggie
 

3243
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,589
can I ever like let's say that Maggie
actually sorry sat

3244
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:36,599
actually sorry sat
 

3245
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:40,549
actually sorry sat
saggy actually had not just three blocks

3246
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
saggy actually had not just three blocks
 

3247
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,650
saggy actually had not just three blocks
of a type but like 25.

3248
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:42,660
of a type but like 25.
 

3249
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,990
of a type but like 25.
so she just like has hella blocks

3250
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:45,000
so she just like has hella blocks
 

3251
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,329
so she just like has hella blocks
right she's uh my question doesn't

3252
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:47,339
right she's uh my question doesn't
 

3253
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,010
right she's uh my question doesn't
matter

3254
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:49,020
matter
 

3255
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,710
matter
the answer is no because

3256
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:51,720
the answer is no because
 

3257
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,990
the answer is no because
um this word here

3258
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,000
um this word here
 

3259
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,789
um this word here
is really critical which is that there's

3260
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:55,799
is really critical which is that there's
 

3261
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:57,530
is really critical which is that there's
strict support right so your block only

3262
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:57,540
strict support right so your block only
 

3263
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,210
strict support right so your block only
has so many faces

3264
01:00:59,210 --> 01:00:59,220
has so many faces
 

3265
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,130
has so many faces
right and in fact

3266
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:01,140
right and in fact
 

3267
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,670
right and in fact
um by by observation one really all that

3268
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:04,680
um by by observation one really all that
 

3269
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,950
um by by observation one really all that
matters is which of the three types of

3270
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
matters is which of the three types of
 

3271
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,930
matters is which of the three types of
faces is sitting on top right because we

3272
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:08,940
faces is sitting on top right because we
 

3273
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,329
faces is sitting on top right because we
can just always rotate right so there's

3274
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:11,339
can just always rotate right so there's
 

3275
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:15,109
can just always rotate right so there's
three configurations of every block

3276
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119

 

3277
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,329

so at most

3278
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:17,339
so at most
 

3279
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:19,609
so at most
can any one configuration appear more

3280
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:19,619
can any one configuration appear more
 

3281
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:21,950
can any one configuration appear more
than one time no because of the strict

3282
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:21,960
than one time no because of the strict
 

3283
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,750
than one time no because of the strict
support condition right otherwise the

3284
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
support condition right otherwise the
 

3285
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,950
support condition right otherwise the
rectangles would match up and that's

3286
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:24,960
rectangles would match up and that's
 

3287
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,410
rectangles would match up and that's
against the rules yeah

3288
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:27,420
against the rules yeah
 

3289
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,470
against the rules yeah
um so in particular

3290
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:30,480
um so in particular
 

3291
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,230
um so in particular
oops the number after two is never after

3292
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:33,240
oops the number after two is never after
 

3293
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,150
oops the number after two is never after
one is is two

3294
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:35,160
one is is two
 

3295
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,069
one is is two
which looks like that

3296
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:37,079
which looks like that
 

3297
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,089
which looks like that
um okay uh right so so in particular um

3298
01:01:41,089 --> 01:01:41,099
um okay uh right so so in particular um
 

3299
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:47,089
um okay uh right so so in particular um
there are only three orientations

3300
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:47,099

 

3301
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:48,829

wait this is just which of the three

3302
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:48,839
wait this is just which of the three
 

3303
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,329
wait this is just which of the three
edges of the block is the one that's

3304
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:50,339
edges of the block is the one that's
 

3305
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,430
edges of the block is the one that's
that's going away from the floor the

3306
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:52,440
that's going away from the floor the
 

3307
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,849
that's going away from the floor the
normal to the ground uh and moreover uh

3308
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:55,859
normal to the ground uh and moreover uh
 

3309
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:56,809
normal to the ground uh and moreover uh
each

3310
01:01:56,809 --> 01:01:56,819
each
 

3311
01:01:56,819 --> 01:01:58,970
each
can appear

3312
01:01:58,970 --> 01:01:58,980
can appear
 

3313
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,730
can appear
less than or equal to one time

3314
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:01,740
less than or equal to one time
 

3315
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,230
less than or equal to one time
that's good because it limits the size

3316
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:03,240
that's good because it limits the size
 

3317
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,430
that's good because it limits the size
of our problem

3318
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:04,440
of our problem
 

3319
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,370
of our problem
uh and finally

3320
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:07,380
uh and finally
 

3321
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,670
uh and finally
um

3322
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:10,680

 

3323
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,309

oops well I collapsed the the two of the

3324
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:13,319
oops well I collapsed the the two of the
 

3325
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:15,170
oops well I collapsed the the two of the
cases in my notes into one case here um

3326
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:15,180
cases in my notes into one case here um
 

3327
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,250
cases in my notes into one case here um
but that's okay

3328
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:16,260
but that's okay
 

3329
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,809
but that's okay
uh and in fact notice that the problem

3330
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:17,819
uh and in fact notice that the problem
 

3331
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:19,549
uh and in fact notice that the problem
tells us that she has at least three of

3332
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:19,559
tells us that she has at least three of
 

3333
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,250
tells us that she has at least three of
each type so in a sense

3334
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:22,260
each type so in a sense
 

3335
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,930
each type so in a sense
if the problem

3336
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:23,940
if the problem
 

3337
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,390
if the problem
um if You observe a one of a block you

3338
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,400
um if You observe a one of a block you
 

3339
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,650
um if You observe a one of a block you
might as well just throw away the rest

3340
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:27,660
might as well just throw away the rest
 

3341
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,630
might as well just throw away the rest
because you know that you can use it at

3342
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:29,640
because you know that you can use it at
 

3343
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,549
because you know that you can use it at
most three times and she has three of

3344
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:31,559
most three times and she has three of
 

3345
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:32,990
most three times and she has three of
that block we can't use it more than

3346
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:33,000
that block we can't use it more than
 

3347
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,309
that block we can't use it more than
three times so and since that's just

3348
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:34,319
three times so and since that's just
 

3349
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,109
three times so and since that's just
Superfluous information

3350
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:36,119
Superfluous information
 

3351
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:37,430
Superfluous information
okay

3352
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,440
okay
 

3353
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,289
okay
right so

3354
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:39,299
right so
 

3355
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:40,430
right so
um

3356
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:40,440
um
 

3357
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,410
um
this allows us to to put a little bit of

3358
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:42,420
this allows us to to put a little bit of
 

3359
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,670
this allows us to to put a little bit of
order here because notice that when I

3360
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
order here because notice that when I
 

3361
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,430
order here because notice that when I
look at the stack of blocks here

3362
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:46,440
look at the stack of blocks here
 

3363
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,130
look at the stack of blocks here
what do we know if I look at the length

3364
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:49,140
what do we know if I look at the length
 

3365
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,750
what do we know if I look at the length
of the long side and the length of the

3366
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:50,760
of the long side and the length of the
 

3367
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,930
of the long side and the length of the
short side in the plane of the ground

3368
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:53,940
short side in the plane of the ground
 

3369
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,150
short side in the plane of the ground
those numbers have to decrease on every

3370
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,160
those numbers have to decrease on every
 

3371
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,309
those numbers have to decrease on every
level of my block right they can never

3372
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
level of my block right they can never
 

3373
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,510
level of my block right they can never
increase that's what the strict support

3374
01:02:59,510 --> 01:02:59,520
increase that's what the strict support
 

3375
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,030
increase that's what the strict support
condition says combined with observation

3376
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:02,040
condition says combined with observation
 

3377
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,069
condition says combined with observation
one actually even without observation

3378
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
one actually even without observation
 

3379
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,390
one actually even without observation
one

3380
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:05,400
one
 

3381
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,490
one
um which is which is good news right

3382
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:07,500
um which is which is good news right
 

3383
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,750
um which is which is good news right
um so this is what's going to allow us

3384
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:08,760
um so this is what's going to allow us
 

3385
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,309
um so this is what's going to allow us
to impose order on our problem namely

3386
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
to impose order on our problem namely
 

3387
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,930
to impose order on our problem namely
that we can sort by The Edge lengths

3388
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:11,940
that we can sort by The Edge lengths
 

3389
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,849
that we can sort by The Edge lengths
because we know that we we have this

3390
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:13,859
because we know that we we have this
 

3391
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:15,710
because we know that we we have this
support condition okay so let's let's

3392
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:15,720
support condition okay so let's let's
 

3393
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:20,630
support condition okay so let's let's
fill in some details of our algorithm

3394
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640

 

3395
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,210

okay

3396
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:23,220

 

3397
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,430

so

3398
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
so
 

3399
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,210
so
right so originally already we can see

3400
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:29,220
right so originally already we can see
 

3401
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,589
right so originally already we can see
that our list of blocks is kind of

3402
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:30,599
that our list of blocks is kind of
 

3403
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,089
that our list of blocks is kind of
useless because the width length and

3404
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:32,099
useless because the width length and
 

3405
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,849
useless because the width length and
height values are sorted in ways that

3406
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:34,859
height values are sorted in ways that
 

3407
01:03:34,859 --> 01:03:37,849
height values are sorted in ways that
don't matter uh moreover if we have more

3408
01:03:37,849 --> 01:03:37,859
don't matter uh moreover if we have more
 

3409
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:39,289
don't matter uh moreover if we have more
than three of a given block that's

3410
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:39,299
than three of a given block that's
 

3411
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:41,750
than three of a given block that's
somehow not super useful

3412
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:41,760
somehow not super useful
 

3413
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,450
somehow not super useful
um so instead of that

3414
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:44,460
um so instead of that
 

3415
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,210
um so instead of that
um Let's uh without loss of generality

3416
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:47,220
um Let's uh without loss of generality
 

3417
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:52,190
um Let's uh without loss of generality
let's assume so w l o g here

3418
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:52,200
let's assume so w l o g here
 

3419
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,250
let's assume so w l o g here
um we can always take our block and

3420
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:55,260
um we can always take our block and
 

3421
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,510
um we can always take our block and
assume

3422
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:56,520
assume
 

3423
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,770
assume
I'm going to do this slightly different

3424
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:57,780
I'm going to do this slightly different
 

3425
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,170
I'm going to do this slightly different
from my notes the width

3426
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:00,180
from my notes the width
 

3427
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:05,450
from my notes the width
is less than or equal to the height

3428
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:05,460

 

3429
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,349

um

3430
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:06,359
um
 

3431
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:08,150
um
is less than or equal to the length Okay

3432
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:08,160
is less than or equal to the length Okay
 

3433
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,609
is less than or equal to the length Okay
so so every block if this isn't the case

3434
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:10,619
so so every block if this isn't the case
 

3435
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:12,109
so so every block if this isn't the case
I could go down my array of blocks and

3436
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:12,119
I could go down my array of blocks and
 

3437
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,329
I could go down my array of blocks and
sort and sorting a list of three numbers

3438
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:14,339
sort and sorting a list of three numbers
 

3439
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:17,030
sort and sorting a list of three numbers
is constant time okay

3440
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:17,040
is constant time okay
 

3441
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,690
is constant time okay
um

3442
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:17,700
um
 

3443
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,870
um
right so what does this allow me to do

3444
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
right so what does this allow me to do
 

3445
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,750
right so what does this allow me to do
well I'm going to say that a block type

3446
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:23,760
well I'm going to say that a block type
 

3447
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,109
well I'm going to say that a block type
actually is an ordered set where the

3448
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:27,119
actually is an ordered set where the
 

3449
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,150
actually is an ordered set where the
third number is going to be the axis

3450
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:29,160
third number is going to be the axis
 

3451
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,950
third number is going to be the axis
that points up

3452
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:30,960
that points up
 

3453
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,450
that points up
and the reason to do that is that we

3454
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:32,460
and the reason to do that is that we
 

3455
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,950
and the reason to do that is that we
know that we can never use that more

3456
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:33,960
know that we can never use that more
 

3457
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,049
know that we can never use that more
than once for any type of a block yeah

3458
01:04:36,049 --> 01:04:36,059
than once for any type of a block yeah
 

3459
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:37,370
than once for any type of a block yeah
so now

3460
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:37,380
so now
 

3461
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:46,670
so now
I'm going to make a new list of blocks

3462
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:46,680

 

3463
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,089

capital B because I like blocks

3464
01:04:50,089 --> 01:04:50,099
capital B because I like blocks
 

3465
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,069
capital B because I like blocks
um and it's going to look like the

3466
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
um and it's going to look like the
 

3467
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,849
um and it's going to look like the
following so if with so if W is less

3468
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:55,859
following so if with so if W is less
 

3469
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:58,309
following so if with so if W is less
than H is less than L then I'm going to

3470
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
than H is less than L then I'm going to
 

3471
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,890
than H is less than L then I'm going to
take every block and duplicate it three

3472
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:00,900
take every block and duplicate it three
 

3473
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,450
take every block and duplicate it three
times

3474
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:02,460
times
 

3475
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,010
times
notice that I might end up with a list

3476
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:04,020
notice that I might end up with a list
 

3477
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,750
notice that I might end up with a list
with like nine times of every block but

3478
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:05,760
with like nine times of every block but
 

3479
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,089
with like nine times of every block but
we will fix that later

3480
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:08,099
we will fix that later
 

3481
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:10,609
we will fix that later
um uh right and it's going to look like

3482
01:05:10,609 --> 01:05:10,619
um uh right and it's going to look like
 

3483
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:12,230
um uh right and it's going to look like
the following

3484
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:12,240
the following
 

3485
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,250
the following
which is the okay I'm going to have w i

3486
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:16,260
which is the okay I'm going to have w i
 

3487
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:19,190
which is the okay I'm going to have w i
h i l i

3488
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:19,200
h i l i
 

3489
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,109
h i l i
this is like describing a way to stack

3490
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
this is like describing a way to stack
 

3491
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,549
this is like describing a way to stack
my block right because it's saying this

3492
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
my block right because it's saying this
 

3493
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,950
my block right because it's saying this
is the short side this is the long side

3494
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
is the short side this is the long side
 

3495
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,990
is the short side this is the long side
this is the vertical side

3496
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:27,000
this is the vertical side
 

3497
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,130
this is the vertical side
yep

3498
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:28,140
yep
 

3499
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,690
yep
and there are three cases right where

3500
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:29,700
and there are three cases right where
 

3501
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,190
and there are three cases right where
any one of these guys can be the

3502
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
any one of these guys can be the
 

3503
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,349
any one of these guys can be the
vertical side right so there's one let's

3504
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359
vertical side right so there's one let's
 

3505
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:36,710
vertical side right so there's one let's
say that the H is the vertical side then

3506
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
say that the H is the vertical side then
 

3507
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,250
say that the H is the vertical side then
W has to go before l so it would be w i

3508
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:40,260
W has to go before l so it would be w i
 

3509
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,069
W has to go before l so it would be w i
l i h i

3510
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:43,079
l i h i
 

3511
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,510
l i h i
and a third one where the third guy is w

3512
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
and a third one where the third guy is w
 

3513
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,170
and a third one where the third guy is w
h is less than l so it would be h i l i

3514
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:51,180
h is less than l so it would be h i l i
 

3515
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,990
h is less than l so it would be h i l i
w i and those are all the different ways

3516
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,000
w i and those are all the different ways
 

3517
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,569
w i and those are all the different ways
that I can sort of Orient uh these

3518
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:56,579
that I can sort of Orient uh these
 

3519
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:59,270
that I can sort of Orient uh these
blocks in my stacking assuming that I

3520
01:05:59,270 --> 01:05:59,280
blocks in my stacking assuming that I
 

3521
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,849
blocks in my stacking assuming that I
um impose condition one for convenience

3522
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:01,859
um impose condition one for convenience
 

3523
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:02,630
um impose condition one for convenience
here

3524
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:02,640
here
 

3525
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,030
here
okay we're going to make a new list of

3526
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:05,040
okay we're going to make a new list of
 

3527
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,130
okay we're going to make a new list of
blocks where I take every block in my

3528
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:07,140
blocks where I take every block in my
 

3529
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,450
blocks where I take every block in my
original set and I just duplicate it

3530
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:08,460
original set and I just duplicate it
 

3531
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,549
original set and I just duplicate it
three times this way after I sort its

3532
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:10,559
three times this way after I sort its
 

3533
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,630
three times this way after I sort its
coordinates

3534
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:11,640
coordinates
 

3535
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,150
coordinates
right and now

3536
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
right and now
 

3537
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,410
right and now
um well what do I need to do well for

3538
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:15,420
um well what do I need to do well for
 

3539
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,549
um well what do I need to do well for
one thing this thing may have too many

3540
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:16,559
one thing this thing may have too many
 

3541
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:17,750
one thing this thing may have too many
blocks I might have a block that's

3542
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
blocks I might have a block that's
 

3543
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,250
blocks I might have a block that's
that's repeated more than one time and I

3544
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:19,260
that's repeated more than one time and I
 

3545
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,750
that's repeated more than one time and I
know I can't do that

3546
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:20,760
know I can't do that
 

3547
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,710
know I can't do that
um and moreover it's going to be

3548
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:21,720
um and moreover it's going to be
 

3549
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,270
um and moreover it's going to be
convenient to have this sorted because I

3550
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:23,280
convenient to have this sorted because I
 

3551
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,430
convenient to have this sorted because I
gotta stack these guys eventually yeah

3552
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:25,440
gotta stack these guys eventually yeah
 

3553
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,789
gotta stack these guys eventually yeah
so I'm going to sort

3554
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:28,799
so I'm going to sort
 

3555
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:32,210
so I'm going to sort
uh that list uh and I want to do it I

3556
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:32,220
uh that list uh and I want to do it I
 

3557
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,370
uh that list uh and I want to do it I
can never say this word

3558
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:33,380
can never say this word
 

3559
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:36,470
can never say this word
lexicographically meaning the I'm going

3560
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:36,480
lexicographically meaning the I'm going
 

3561
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,910
lexicographically meaning the I'm going
to sort of the first coordinate and the

3562
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
to sort of the first coordinate and the
 

3563
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:43,329
to sort of the first coordinate and the
second and the third

3564
01:06:43,329 --> 01:06:43,339

 

3565
01:06:43,339 --> 01:06:45,289

lexicographically

3566
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:45,299
lexicographically
 

3567
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:47,990
lexicographically
um notice this length is 3n if I had n

3568
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
um notice this length is 3n if I had n
 

3569
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,270
um notice this length is 3n if I had n
blocks to start with so this entire

3570
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:50,280
blocks to start with so this entire
 

3571
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,089
blocks to start with so this entire
thing takes order n log

3572
01:06:53,089 --> 01:06:53,099
thing takes order n log
 

3573
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:57,170
thing takes order n log
n time which is important to account for

3574
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:57,180
n time which is important to account for
 

3575
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:03,109
n time which is important to account for
um and then I can remove duplicates

3576
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119

 

3577
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,789

I'll let you guys convince yourself you

3578
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:04,799
I'll let you guys convince yourself you
 

3579
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,890
I'll let you guys convince yourself you
can do this in order end time an easy

3580
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:06,900
can do this in order end time an easy
 

3581
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,690
can do this in order end time an easy
way would be to make a second array uh

3582
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:08,700
way would be to make a second array uh
 

3583
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,490
way would be to make a second array uh
and just kind of move and only add stuff

3584
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:10,500
and just kind of move and only add stuff
 

3585
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,049
and just kind of move and only add stuff
when when you you didn't see the same

3586
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:12,059
when when you you didn't see the same
 

3587
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:13,370
when when you you didn't see the same
thing before

3588
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:13,380
thing before
 

3589
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,910
thing before
okay and finally now these are ordered

3590
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:16,920
okay and finally now these are ordered
 

3591
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,470
okay and finally now these are ordered
in a really nice way right because I can

3592
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:18,480
in a really nice way right because I can
 

3593
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,150
in a really nice way right because I can
stack my blocks

3594
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:20,160
stack my blocks
 

3595
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,309
stack my blocks
but only ever looking to the right in my

3596
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:22,319
but only ever looking to the right in my
 

3597
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,470
but only ever looking to the right in my
sorted list

3598
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,480
sorted list
 

3599
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,210
sorted list
right assuming that I'm stacking from

3600
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:26,220
right assuming that I'm stacking from
 

3601
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,730
right assuming that I'm stacking from
the top of my tower down

3602
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:28,740
the top of my tower down
 

3603
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,410
the top of my tower down
which is I think sort of uh what's

3604
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:30,420
which is I think sort of uh what's
 

3605
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,990
which is I think sort of uh what's
what's going on in this thing

3606
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:33,000
what's going on in this thing
 

3607
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,930
what's going on in this thing
okay so now finally we can do our sort

3608
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:35,940
okay so now finally we can do our sort
 

3609
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,890
okay so now finally we can do our sort
bot um and I might do S and R and T and

3610
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:39,900
bot um and I might do S and R and T and
 

3611
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,390
bot um and I might do S and R and T and
then allow you guys to think about the

3612
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:41,400
then allow you guys to think about the
 

3613
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,710
then allow you guys to think about the
rest because as usual I'm talking too

3614
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:42,720
rest because as usual I'm talking too
 

3615
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,609
rest because as usual I'm talking too
much uh okay so

3616
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:45,619
much uh okay so
 

3617
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:47,329
much uh okay so
now

3618
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:47,339
now
 

3619
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:48,349
now
um this is starting to look like a

3620
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:48,359
um this is starting to look like a
 

3621
01:07:48,359 --> 01:07:50,029
um this is starting to look like a
subsequence problem right because

3622
01:07:50,029 --> 01:07:50,039
subsequence problem right because
 

3623
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:52,670
subsequence problem right because
essentially when I stack my blocks if I

3624
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:52,680
essentially when I stack my blocks if I
 

3625
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,890
essentially when I stack my blocks if I
use this block here again if I'm

3626
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:54,900
use this block here again if I'm
 

3627
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,470
use this block here again if I'm
stacking from my tower from the top down

3628
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:57,480
stacking from my tower from the top down
 

3629
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,210
stacking from my tower from the top down
all the blocks that can sit underneath

3630
01:07:59,210 --> 01:07:59,220
all the blocks that can sit underneath
 

3631
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,210
all the blocks that can sit underneath
this one have to be farther to the right

3632
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:02,220
this one have to be farther to the right
 

3633
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:04,010
this one have to be farther to the right
in my array because of the way that I

3634
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:04,020
in my array because of the way that I
 

3635
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,109
in my array because of the way that I
sorted

3636
01:08:06,109 --> 01:08:06,119
sorted
 

3637
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:08,089
sorted
now that doesn't mean that I can put

3638
01:08:08,089 --> 01:08:08,099
now that doesn't mean that I can put
 

3639
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:10,190
now that doesn't mean that I can put
anything on the right underneath this

3640
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:10,200
anything on the right underneath this
 

3641
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,870
anything on the right underneath this
guy but it does mean that I know nothing

3642
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:11,880
guy but it does mean that I know nothing
 

3643
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,730
guy but it does mean that I know nothing
to the left can go underneath this guy

3644
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:13,740
to the left can go underneath this guy
 

3645
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,410
to the left can go underneath this guy
that's that's the way to think about it

3646
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:15,420
that's that's the way to think about it
 

3647
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,269
that's that's the way to think about it
Okay so

3648
01:08:17,269 --> 01:08:17,279
Okay so
 

3649
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,090
Okay so
here's gonna be sore bus so s what I'm

3650
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:20,100
here's gonna be sore bus so s what I'm
 

3651
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,169
here's gonna be sore bus so s what I'm
going to say is that x i here is equal

3652
01:08:24,169 --> 01:08:24,179
going to say is that x i here is equal
 

3653
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:26,689
going to say is that x i here is equal
to the maximum height of my tower

3654
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:26,699
to the maximum height of my tower
 

3655
01:08:26,699 --> 01:08:28,669
to the maximum height of my tower
and I'm going to taking a little bit of

3656
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:28,679
and I'm going to taking a little bit of
 

3657
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:30,349
and I'm going to taking a little bit of
inspiration from our subsequence problem

3658
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:30,359
inspiration from our subsequence problem
 

3659
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:32,570
inspiration from our subsequence problem
that we've already seen I'm gonna I'm

3660
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:32,580
that we've already seen I'm gonna I'm
 

3661
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,970
that we've already seen I'm gonna I'm
gonna force myself to use block I we'll

3662
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:34,980
gonna force myself to use block I we'll
 

3663
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:46,309
gonna force myself to use block I we'll
see that's convenient

3664
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:46,319

 

3665
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:53,329

I and possibly

3666
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:53,339

 

3667
01:08:53,339 --> 01:08:55,309

just for fun maybe we'll do the the

3668
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:55,319
just for fun maybe we'll do the the
 

3669
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:58,249
just for fun maybe we'll do the the
prefix version of this problem this time

3670
01:08:58,249 --> 01:08:58,259
prefix version of this problem this time
 

3671
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,249
prefix version of this problem this time
um so now uh

3672
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:01,259
um so now uh
 

3673
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:03,950
um so now uh
I can use any of the previous blocks

3674
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:03,960
I can use any of the previous blocks
 

3675
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,990
I can use any of the previous blocks
right so I can use the first eye blocks

3676
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,000
right so I can use the first eye blocks
 

3677
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,849
right so I can use the first eye blocks
to make a tower but I'm forced to use

3678
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:07,859
to make a tower but I'm forced to use
 

3679
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:09,769
to make a tower but I'm forced to use
block eye by the way I'm from now on

3680
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:09,779
block eye by the way I'm from now on
 

3681
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,450
block eye by the way I'm from now on
when I use indices into this sorted

3682
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:11,460
when I use indices into this sorted
 

3683
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,689
when I use indices into this sorted
array okay

3684
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:14,699

 

3685
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:17,209

um so this is a problem obviously uh if

3686
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:17,219
um so this is a problem obviously uh if
 

3687
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,769
um so this is a problem obviously uh if
I could solve for x I would be done

3688
01:09:18,769 --> 01:09:18,779
I could solve for x I would be done
 

3689
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:19,970
I could solve for x I would be done
right because I could get the maximum

3690
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:19,980
right because I could get the maximum
 

3691
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:22,249
right because I could get the maximum
height by just iterating over all the

3692
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:22,259
height by just iterating over all the
 

3693
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,829
height by just iterating over all the
x's and choosing the biggest possible

3694
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
x's and choosing the biggest possible
 

3695
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,630
x's and choosing the biggest possible
value here and the question is how do I

3696
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:26,640
value here and the question is how do I
 

3697
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:33,410
value here and the question is how do I
do this uh recursively

3698
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:33,420

 

3699
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:37,490

so uh here's our uh recursive step

3700
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:37,500
so uh here's our uh recursive step
 

3701
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,570
so uh here's our uh recursive step
so

3702
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:38,580
so
 

3703
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:41,689
so
let's say that I use block I

3704
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:41,699
let's say that I use block I
 

3705
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:44,870
let's say that I use block I
well because we we know we have to right

3706
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
well because we we know we have to right
 

3707
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,450
well because we we know we have to right
um so in particular

3708
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:47,460
um so in particular
 

3709
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,209
um so in particular
right we have uh now I'm seeing why they

3710
01:09:50,209 --> 01:09:50,219
right we have uh now I'm seeing why they
 

3711
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,189
right we have uh now I'm seeing why they
didn't use this notation uh in their

3712
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:52,199
didn't use this notation uh in their
 

3713
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:53,490
didn't use this notation uh in their
answer but that's okay

3714
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:53,500
answer but that's okay
 

3715
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,590
answer but that's okay
[Music]

3716
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:54,600
[Music]
 

3717
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:00,290
[Music]
um

3718
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:00,300

 

3719
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,150

let's use another letter to refer to the

3720
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:02,160
let's use another letter to refer to the
 

3721
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,590
let's use another letter to refer to the
third coordinate

3722
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
third coordinate
 

3723
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,700
third coordinate
uh

3724
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:04,710
uh
 

3725
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:08,030
uh
[Laughter]

3726
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:08,040
[Laughter]
 

3727
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,130
[Laughter]
yeah let's say VI is always the third

3728
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:10,140
yeah let's say VI is always the third
 

3729
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,570
yeah let's say VI is always the third
coordinate so I've already used wh and L

3730
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:11,580
coordinate so I've already used wh and L
 

3731
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,890
coordinate so I've already used wh and L
and I'm afraid if I reuse them after

3732
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:12,900
and I'm afraid if I reuse them after
 

3733
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,990
and I'm afraid if I reuse them after
sorting it's going to confuse people

3734
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,000
sorting it's going to confuse people
 

3735
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,930
sorting it's going to confuse people
um so v i is the third coordinate

3736
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:20,940
um so v i is the third coordinate
 

3737
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,689
um so v i is the third coordinate
of the is element of my my sorted array

3738
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:23,699
of the is element of my my sorted array
 

3739
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:26,090
of the is element of my my sorted array
that's fine okay

3740
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:26,100
that's fine okay
 

3741
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,970
that's fine okay
um right so what is my height uh if I

3742
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:28,980
um right so what is my height uh if I
 

3743
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,410
um right so what is my height uh if I
use a

3744
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:30,420
use a
 

3745
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:34,010
use a
x i here well I get some height from VI

3746
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:34,020
x i here well I get some height from VI
 

3747
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,990
x i here well I get some height from VI
and in addition to that I get whatever I

3748
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,000
and in addition to that I get whatever I
 

3749
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,110
and in addition to that I get whatever I
I stack uh underneath that guy yeah

3750
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,120
I stack uh underneath that guy yeah
 

3751
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,790
I stack uh underneath that guy yeah
um so in particular

3752
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:40,800
um so in particular
 

3753
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,050
um so in particular
um

3754
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:42,060
um
 

3755
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,810
um
I get that x i well I get the height of

3756
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:44,820
I get that x i well I get the height of
 

3757
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,990
I get that x i well I get the height of
the block that I just decided to use

3758
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:47,000
the block that I just decided to use
 

3759
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,770
the block that I just decided to use
and now

3760
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:48,780
and now
 

3761
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,870
and now
what are all my cases

3762
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:50,880
what are all my cases
 

3763
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,030
what are all my cases
well I could decide to do nothing else

3764
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:53,040
well I could decide to do nothing else
 

3765
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,370
well I could decide to do nothing else
like just not use any other blocks that

3766
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:55,380
like just not use any other blocks that
 

3767
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,709
like just not use any other blocks that
gives me a height of zero

3768
01:10:57,709 --> 01:10:57,719
gives me a height of zero
 

3769
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,750
gives me a height of zero
or

3770
01:10:59,750 --> 01:10:59,760
or
 

3771
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,870
or
well let's see here

3772
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:02,880
well let's see here
 

3773
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,790
well let's see here
I could use the X's but I have to be

3774
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:04,800
I could use the X's but I have to be
 

3775
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,290
I could use the X's but I have to be
careful that I can actually stack them

3776
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:06,300
careful that I can actually stack them
 

3777
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,189
careful that I can actually stack them
yeah so in particular

3778
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:10,199

 

3779
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:15,290

well uh I need

3780
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:15,300

 

3781
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:20,390

yeah I I can take an XJ value but I got

3782
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,400
yeah I I can take an XJ value but I got
 

3783
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,470
yeah I I can take an XJ value but I got
to be careful that I can stack it

3784
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:21,480
to be careful that I can stack it
 

3785
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,890
to be careful that I can stack it
underneath so in particular

3786
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:24,900
underneath so in particular
 

3787
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:25,850
underneath so in particular
um

3788
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:25,860
um
 

3789
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,750
um
what do we know well I can do

3790
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:29,760
what do we know well I can do
 

3791
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,010
what do we know well I can do
anything from one to I minus one

3792
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:34,020
anything from one to I minus one
 

3793
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,810
anything from one to I minus one
right because that's sort of the

3794
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:35,820
right because that's sort of the
 

3795
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,729
right because that's sort of the
definition of x i

3796
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:37,739
definition of x i
 

3797
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:41,930
definition of x i
but in particular

3798
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:41,940

 

3799
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,590

I can stack it on top

3800
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:45,600

 

3801
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,750

right so one easy way to do this is like

3802
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:47,760
right so one easy way to do this is like
 

3803
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,090
right so one easy way to do this is like
it just array I I iterate through the

3804
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:50,100
it just array I I iterate through the
 

3805
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,130
it just array I I iterate through the
first I minus one elements of my array

3806
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:52,140
first I minus one elements of my array
 

3807
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,689
first I minus one elements of my array
and I just check my stacking condition

3808
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:53,699
and I just check my stacking condition
 

3809
01:11:53,699 --> 01:11:55,669
and I just check my stacking condition
for every single one of them relative to

3810
01:11:55,669 --> 01:11:55,679
for every single one of them relative to
 

3811
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,950
for every single one of them relative to
block J right so in other words that the

3812
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:57,960
block J right so in other words that the
 

3813
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,590
block J right so in other words that the
the width and the height or rather the

3814
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:00,600
the width and the height or rather the
 

3815
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,510
the width and the height or rather the
first and the second coordinate satisfy

3816
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:02,520
first and the second coordinate satisfy
 

3817
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,370
first and the second coordinate satisfy
the strict inequalities that I need

3818
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:04,380
the strict inequalities that I need
 

3819
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,950
the strict inequalities that I need
I'm phrasing this sentence neutrally

3820
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:06,960
I'm phrasing this sentence neutrally
 

3821
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,390
I'm phrasing this sentence neutrally
because I forget whether this is

3822
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:08,400
because I forget whether this is
 

3823
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,729
because I forget whether this is
increasing or decreasing but in any

3824
01:12:10,729 --> 01:12:10,739
increasing or decreasing but in any
 

3825
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:11,510
increasing or decreasing but in any
event

3826
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
event
 

3827
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,130
event
um so what do I do I check all of the

3828
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:13,140
um so what do I do I check all of the
 

3829
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,890
um so what do I do I check all of the
blocks that I could possibly stack from

3830
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:15,900
blocks that I could possibly stack from
 

3831
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,450
blocks that I could possibly stack from
the index of the array perspective I

3832
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:17,460
the index of the array perspective I
 

3833
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,649
the index of the array perspective I
make sure that I could actually stack

3834
01:12:18,649 --> 01:12:18,659
make sure that I could actually stack
 

3835
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:21,110
make sure that I could actually stack
them thanks to the the size of the

3836
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,120
them thanks to the the size of the
 

3837
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,669
them thanks to the the size of the
current block that I just decided to add

3838
01:12:22,669 --> 01:12:22,679
current block that I just decided to add
 

3839
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:23,930
current block that I just decided to add
to my stack

3840
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:23,940
to my stack
 

3841
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,450
to my stack
um and I I move recursively

3842
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:26,460
um and I I move recursively
 

3843
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,750
um and I I move recursively
okay right so this is great because now

3844
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
okay right so this is great because now
 

3845
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,250
okay right so this is great because now
I'm learning exactly the recursive

3846
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:31,260
I'm learning exactly the recursive
 

3847
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,810
I'm learning exactly the recursive
scenario we wanted to be in right

3848
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,820
scenario we wanted to be in right
 

3849
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:36,530
scenario we wanted to be in right
because X I only depends on XJ where J

3850
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:36,540
because X I only depends on XJ where J
 

3851
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,990
because X I only depends on XJ where J
is smaller than I and that is exactly

3852
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:39,000
is smaller than I and that is exactly
 

3853
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,310
is smaller than I and that is exactly
our topological uh ordering that we need

3854
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:43,320
our topological uh ordering that we need
 

3855
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,810
our topological uh ordering that we need
if you do that on your homework you get

3856
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:44,820
if you do that on your homework you get
 

3857
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,149
if you do that on your homework you get
minus n for large m

3858
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:47,159
minus n for large m
 

3859
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,229
minus n for large m
okay

3860
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:48,239
okay
 

3861
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,630
okay
uh similarly uh what's our base case

3862
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:50,640
uh similarly uh what's our base case
 

3863
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,370
uh similarly uh what's our base case
well

3864
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:52,380
well
 

3865
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,870
well
obviously

3866
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:53,880
obviously
 

3867
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,510
obviously
um if I only have one block I might as

3868
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:56,520
um if I only have one block I might as
 

3869
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,209
um if I only have one block I might as
well use it yeah so in that case we have

3870
01:12:59,209 --> 01:12:59,219
well use it yeah so in that case we have
 

3871
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:02,450
well use it yeah so in that case we have
x one is equal to I guess in our

3872
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:02,460
x one is equal to I guess in our
 

3873
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,370
x one is equal to I guess in our
notation here like that

3874
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:04,380
notation here like that
 

3875
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,729
notation here like that
uh our original one we have to look a

3876
01:13:07,729 --> 01:13:07,739
uh our original one we have to look a
 

3877
01:13:07,739 --> 01:13:08,870
uh our original one we have to look a
little bit careful because of the way

3878
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:08,880
little bit careful because of the way
 

3879
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,729
little bit careful because of the way
that I've defined X

3880
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:10,739
that I've defined X
 

3881
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:13,669
that I've defined X
because X assumes that I've used a

3882
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:13,679
because X assumes that I've used a
 

3883
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,229
because X assumes that I've used a
particular block

3884
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:15,239
particular block
 

3885
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:17,689
particular block
right so I have to say well I might not

3886
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:17,699
right so I have to say well I might not
 

3887
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:19,370
right so I have to say well I might not
have actually chosen you know the very

3888
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:19,380
have actually chosen you know the very
 

3889
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,770
have actually chosen you know the very
last block as the one I want to keep

3890
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:21,780
last block as the one I want to keep
 

3891
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,990
last block as the one I want to keep
um so I have to iterate I could say

3892
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:24,000
um so I have to iterate I could say
 

3893
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,350
um so I have to iterate I could say
that really my original is the max over

3894
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:27,360
that really my original is the max over
 

3895
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,090
that really my original is the max over
I of x i right so one of these blocks

3896
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:29,100
I of x i right so one of these blocks
 

3897
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,649
I of x i right so one of these blocks
has to be the block on top I'm just

3898
01:13:30,649 --> 01:13:30,659
has to be the block on top I'm just
 

3899
01:13:30,659 --> 01:13:31,729
has to be the block on top I'm just
going to iterate over all the possible

3900
01:13:31,729 --> 01:13:31,739
going to iterate over all the possible
 

3901
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:33,169
going to iterate over all the possible
ones and find it

3902
01:13:33,169 --> 01:13:33,179
ones and find it
 

3903
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:35,270
ones and find it
and then our final thing to do is the

3904
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,280
and then our final thing to do is the
 

3905
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,090
and then our final thing to do is the
runtime t

3906
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:38,100
runtime t
 

3907
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,209
runtime t
um this one is the mildly trickier than

3908
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:41,219
um this one is the mildly trickier than
 

3909
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:43,189
um this one is the mildly trickier than
the previous runtimes that we've done so

3910
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:43,199
the previous runtimes that we've done so
 

3911
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,050
the previous runtimes that we've done so
far in our example problem

3912
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:45,060
far in our example problem
 

3913
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,790
far in our example problem
in particular

3914
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:46,800
in particular
 

3915
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,270
in particular
uh how many sub problems are there well

3916
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:50,280
uh how many sub problems are there well
 

3917
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,390
uh how many sub problems are there well
there's N Sub problems or I'll say order

3918
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:53,400
there's N Sub problems or I'll say order
 

3919
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,610
there's N Sub problems or I'll say order
n because I'm always off by one

3920
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:55,620
n because I'm always off by one
 

3921
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:59,209
n because I'm always off by one
um

3922
01:13:59,209 --> 01:13:59,219

 

3923
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:01,430

right corresponding to each uh Block in

3924
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:01,440
right corresponding to each uh Block in
 

3925
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,370
right corresponding to each uh Block in
my my stack here

3926
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:04,380

 

3927
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,930

but how much time does each sub problem

3928
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:05,940
but how much time does each sub problem
 

3929
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,010
but how much time does each sub problem
take at least the way that I've written

3930
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:07,020
take at least the way that I've written
 

3931
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,630
take at least the way that I've written
it here

3932
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:08,640
it here
 

3933
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,669
it here
um well what do I have to do I have to

3934
01:14:10,669 --> 01:14:10,679
um well what do I have to do I have to
 

3935
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:12,709
um well what do I have to do I have to
Loop over all of the possible blocks and

3936
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:12,719
Loop over all of the possible blocks and
 

3937
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,189
Loop over all of the possible blocks and
find the one that I can stack on top of

3938
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:16,199
find the one that I can stack on top of
 

3939
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:18,169
find the one that I can stack on top of
and then take the max so there's a loop

3940
01:14:18,169 --> 01:14:18,179
and then take the max so there's a loop
 

3941
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:19,130
and then take the max so there's a loop
here

3942
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:19,140
here
 

3943
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,430
here
from 1 to I I is upper bounded by n

3944
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:22,440
from 1 to I I is upper bounded by n
 

3945
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,669
from 1 to I I is upper bounded by n
so this is order N Sub problems Times

3946
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:25,679
so this is order N Sub problems Times
 

3947
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,169
so this is order N Sub problems Times
order n

3948
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:27,179
order n
 

3949
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:28,910
order n
work

3950
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:28,920
work
 

3951
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:32,390
work
per sub problem

3952
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400
per sub problem
 

3953
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,370
per sub problem
so at the end of the day

3954
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:34,380
so at the end of the day
 

3955
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,870
so at the end of the day
my algorithm

3956
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:35,880
my algorithm
 

3957
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,630
my algorithm
is going to be order N squared

3958
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
is going to be order N squared
 

3959
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,610
is going to be order N squared
and of course again I guess I had I

3960
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:40,620
and of course again I guess I had I
 

3961
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:41,570
and of course again I guess I had I
promised it and then I didn't actually

3962
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:41,580
promised it and then I didn't actually
 

3963
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,490
promised it and then I didn't actually
do it to actually implement this

3964
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:43,500
do it to actually implement this
 

3965
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,169
do it to actually implement this
algorithm there's sort of two different

3966
01:14:45,169 --> 01:14:45,179
algorithm there's sort of two different
 

3967
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:47,330
algorithm there's sort of two different
ways to do it right I could write a

3968
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:47,340
ways to do it right I could write a
 

3969
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,790
ways to do it right I could write a
recursive call plus a table right the

3970
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:49,800
recursive call plus a table right the
 

3971
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,290
recursive call plus a table right the
table is maybe initialized to a bunch of

3972
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:51,300
table is maybe initialized to a bunch of
 

3973
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,930
table is maybe initialized to a bunch of
nands and then I implement this function

3974
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:53,940
nands and then I implement this function
 

3975
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,689
nands and then I implement this function
recursively but before I do that I say

3976
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:56,699
recursively but before I do that I say
 

3977
01:14:56,699 --> 01:14:58,729
recursively but before I do that I say
if the table does not equal Nan just

3978
01:14:58,729 --> 01:14:58,739
if the table does not equal Nan just
 

3979
01:14:58,739 --> 01:14:59,930
if the table does not equal Nan just
return the value in the table and

3980
01:14:59,930 --> 01:14:59,940
return the value in the table and
 

3981
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:02,630
return the value in the table and
otherwise you know call this recursion

3982
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:02,640
otherwise you know call this recursion
 

3983
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,330
otherwise you know call this recursion
or I could just have a for loop from 1

3984
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:05,340
or I could just have a for loop from 1
 

3985
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,030
or I could just have a for loop from 1
to n and build up the table uh one

3986
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:08,040
to n and build up the table uh one
 

3987
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,890
to n and build up the table uh one
element at a time and both of those are

3988
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:09,900
element at a time and both of those are
 

3989
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,990
element at a time and both of those are
exactly the same from a runtime

3990
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:12,000
exactly the same from a runtime
 

3991
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,490
exactly the same from a runtime
perspective

3992
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:13,500
perspective
 

3993
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,410
perspective
okay so I think I've managed to botch

3994
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:15,420
okay so I think I've managed to botch
 

3995
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,030
okay so I think I've managed to botch
that much more than my notes or the

3996
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:17,040
that much more than my notes or the
 

3997
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,070
that much more than my notes or the
written solution uh but uh the problem

3998
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:19,080
written solution uh but uh the problem
 

3999
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:19,970
written solution uh but uh the problem
itself is actually pretty

4000
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:19,980
itself is actually pretty
 

4001
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,169
itself is actually pretty
straightforward so if you guys read

4002
01:15:21,169 --> 01:15:21,179
straightforward so if you guys read
 

4003
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:22,970
straightforward so if you guys read
through the answer plus some of the I

4004
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:22,980
through the answer plus some of the I
 

4005
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,470
through the answer plus some of the I
think actually the hard parts of this

4006
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,480
think actually the hard parts of this
 

4007
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,209
think actually the hard parts of this
problem were not the dynamic programming

4008
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:26,219
problem were not the dynamic programming
 

4009
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:27,470
problem were not the dynamic programming
it was all the observations you need to

4010
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:27,480
it was all the observations you need to
 

4011
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,149
it was all the observations you need to
get there so that's why I I spent a

4012
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:29,159
get there so that's why I I spent a
 

4013
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:31,189
get there so that's why I I spent a
little more time there

4014
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
little more time there
 

4015
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,470
little more time there
okay so as usual I haven't left myself

4016
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:33,480
okay so as usual I haven't left myself
 

4017
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,930
okay so as usual I haven't left myself
enough time for the last uh problem but

4018
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:35,940
enough time for the last uh problem but
 

4019
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,550
enough time for the last uh problem but
we have a few minutes and and that'll be

4020
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:37,560
we have a few minutes and and that'll be
 

4021
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,890
we have a few minutes and and that'll be
that'll be sufficient to set up the the

4022
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:39,900
that'll be sufficient to set up the the
 

4023
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,630
that'll be sufficient to set up the the
I actually found the last problem to be

4024
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:41,640
I actually found the last problem to be
 

4025
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,970
I actually found the last problem to be
easier even though it technically is

4026
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:43,980
easier even though it technically is
 

4027
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,010
easier even though it technically is
sort of two Dynamic programs in one

4028
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:46,020
sort of two Dynamic programs in one
 

4029
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,510
sort of two Dynamic programs in one
um somehow I think the logic is a little

4030
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:47,520
um somehow I think the logic is a little
 

4031
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,340
um somehow I think the logic is a little
easier okay so uh

4032
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:52,350
easier okay so uh
 

4033
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:55,970
easier okay so uh
[Music]

4034
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:55,980

 

4035
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,890

I think this is the backboard yeah

4036
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:57,900
I think this is the backboard yeah
 

4037
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,330
I think this is the backboard yeah
that's that's I was just realizing that

4038
01:15:59,330 --> 01:15:59,340
that's that's I was just realizing that
 

4039
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:00,830
that's that's I was just realizing that
this room doesn't work the same way as

4040
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:00,840
this room doesn't work the same way as
 

4041
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,470
this room doesn't work the same way as
the other one uh yeah this is

4042
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:03,480
the other one uh yeah this is
 

4043
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,850
the other one uh yeah this is
embarrassing you know I spent all day

4044
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:04,860
embarrassing you know I spent all day
 

4045
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,070
embarrassing you know I spent all day
thinking about topology and this is like

4046
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:07,080
thinking about topology and this is like
 

4047
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,950
thinking about topology and this is like
a classic kind of you know problem in

4048
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:09,960
a classic kind of you know problem in
 

4049
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,570
a classic kind of you know problem in
that Universe

4050
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:11,580
that Universe
 

4051
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:14,390
that Universe
um

4052
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400

 

4053
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,090

Okay so we'll just erase one board at a

4054
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:17,100
Okay so we'll just erase one board at a
 

4055
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,770
Okay so we'll just erase one board at a
time and I'll try not to write three

4056
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:18,780
time and I'll try not to write three
 

4057
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,550
time and I'll try not to write three
feet

4058
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:19,560
feet
 

4059
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,709
feet
um live this time oh this is probably

4060
01:16:21,709 --> 01:16:21,719
um live this time oh this is probably
 

4061
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:25,070
um live this time oh this is probably
the one board I shouldn't use

4062
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:25,080

 

4063
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,570

01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,850

so

4066
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:31,860
so
 

4067
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,250
so
right and our final problem we're given

4068
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:34,260
right and our final problem we're given

right so here's our basic setup there's
 

4079
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:53,090
right so here's our basic setup there's
a big grid of stuff

4080
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:53,100

 

4081
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,470

or maybe a small grade because I don't

4082
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:54,480
or maybe a small grade because I don't
 

4083
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,270
or maybe a small grade because I don't
feel like drawing and and every grid

4084
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:56,280
feel like drawing and and every grid
 

4085
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,610
feel like drawing and and every grid
Square can have one of three things you

4086
01:16:58,610 --> 01:16:58,620
Square can have one of three things you
 

4087
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,830
Square can have one of three things you
can have a mushroom you can have a tree

4088
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:00,840
can have a mushroom you can have a tree
 

4089
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,470
can have a mushroom you can have a tree
or it can have nothing at all

4090
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:03,480
or it can have nothing at all
 

4091
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:07,790
or it can have nothing at all
and uh our princess starts here

4092
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:07,800
and uh our princess starts here
 

4093
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,790
and uh our princess starts here
and she goes she wants to go there

4094
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:10,800
and she goes she wants to go there
 

4095
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,729
and she goes she wants to go there
uh and and and

4096
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:12,739
uh and and and
 

4097
01:17:12,739 --> 01:17:15,590
uh and and and
moreover uh there's a couple things that

4098
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:15,600
moreover uh there's a couple things that
 

4099
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,050
moreover uh there's a couple things that
are worth noting here so first of all

4100
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:18,060
are worth noting here so first of all
 

4101
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:23,209
are worth noting here so first of all
um her path is quick

4102
01:17:23,209 --> 01:17:23,219

 

4103
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:27,350

meaning that she can only Traverse two n

4104
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:27,360
meaning that she can only Traverse two n
 

4105
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:32,750
meaning that she can only Traverse two n
minus one grid squares

4106
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:32,760

 

4107
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,450

um

4108
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:35,460

 

4109
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,450

to get from one corner to the other

4110
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:38,460
to get from one corner to the other
 

4111
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,970
to get from one corner to the other
and apparently she's very into mushrooms

4112
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:40,980
and apparently she's very into mushrooms
 

4113
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,430
and apparently she's very into mushrooms
and she'd like to accumulate as as many

4114
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
and she'd like to accumulate as as many
 

4115
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,470
and she'd like to accumulate as as many
as possible along her path right that's

4116
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:45,480
as possible along her path right that's
 

4117
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,390
as possible along her path right that's
the basic setup here so she wants to get

4118
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:47,400
the basic setup here so she wants to get
 

4119
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,390
the basic setup here so she wants to get
from the upper left to lower right

4120
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:50,400
from the upper left to lower right
 

4121
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,270
from the upper left to lower right
and uh in order to do so uh she wants to

4122
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:53,280
and uh in order to do so uh she wants to
 

4123
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,310
and uh in order to do so uh she wants to
take a quick path so she her main

4124
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:55,320
take a quick path so she her main
 

4125
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,229
take a quick path so she her main
priority is to be efficient but among

4126
01:17:57,229 --> 01:17:57,239
priority is to be efficient but among
 

4127
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,090
priority is to be efficient but among
the different quick paths

4128
01:17:59,090 --> 01:17:59,100
the different quick paths
 

4129
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,430
the different quick paths
she wants to pick up a lot of mushrooms

4130
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:01,440
she wants to pick up a lot of mushrooms
 

4131
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,649
she wants to pick up a lot of mushrooms
it's understandable

4132
01:18:03,649 --> 01:18:03,659
it's understandable
 

4133
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:05,870
it's understandable
and not walk through trees thank you all

4134
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:05,880
and not walk through trees thank you all
 

4135
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,610
and not walk through trees thank you all
right so like maybe there's some grid

4136
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:07,620
right so like maybe there's some grid
 

4137
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,750
right so like maybe there's some grid
squares that are marked with like a tree

4138
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:08,760
squares that are marked with like a tree
 

4139
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,669
squares that are marked with like a tree
meaning that you just can't go there

4140
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:10,679
meaning that you just can't go there
 

4141
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:12,890
meaning that you just can't go there
that's a tree

4142
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:12,900
that's a tree
 

4143
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:16,130
that's a tree
um okay uh uh right so that's our our

4144
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:16,140
um okay uh uh right so that's our our
 

4145
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,770
um okay uh uh right so that's our our
basic setup here but the problem does it

4146
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:18,780
basic setup here but the problem does it
 

4147
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:20,030
basic setup here but the problem does it
takes a bit of a Twist right it's not

4148
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:20,040
takes a bit of a Twist right it's not
 

4149
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,229
takes a bit of a Twist right it's not
saying just

4150
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:21,239
saying just
 

4151
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:22,669
saying just
could be the shortest path which should

4152
01:18:22,669 --> 01:18:22,679
could be the shortest path which should
 

4153
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:24,470
could be the shortest path which should
be very much like the last kind of unit

4154
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:24,480
be very much like the last kind of unit
 

4155
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,510
be very much like the last kind of unit
in six double o six

4156
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:26,520
in six double o six
 

4157
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,270
in six double o six
um but rather uh the question is sort of

4158
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,280
um but rather uh the question is sort of
 

4159
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,450
um but rather uh the question is sort of
what is the number of paths that she can

4160
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:32,460
what is the number of paths that she can
 

4161
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:35,630
what is the number of paths that she can
take from one side to the other

4162
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:35,640
take from one side to the other
 

4163
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,370
take from one side to the other
um and what is the maximum number of

4164
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:37,380
um and what is the maximum number of
 

4165
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,590
um and what is the maximum number of
mushrooms is roughly the question asking

4166
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:39,600
mushrooms is roughly the question asking
 

4167
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,570
mushrooms is roughly the question asking
at least what I remember from reading it

4168
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:41,580
at least what I remember from reading it
 

4169
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:44,930
at least what I remember from reading it
last night

4170
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:44,940

 

4171
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:47,510

that's right so so so she has to take

4172
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:47,520
that's right so so so she has to take
 

4173
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,790
that's right so so so she has to take
the most number of mushrooms she can but

4174
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:49,800
the most number of mushrooms she can but
 

4175
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,470
the most number of mushrooms she can but
there may be more than one path uh that

4176
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:51,480
there may be more than one path uh that
 

4177
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,850
there may be more than one path uh that
gets you there that is quick that

4178
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:52,860
gets you there that is quick that
 

4179
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,709
gets you there that is quick that
satisfies this condition in which case

4180
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:54,719
satisfies this condition in which case
 

4181
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,270
satisfies this condition in which case
she wants the count of the total number

4182
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:56,280
she wants the count of the total number
 

4183
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,770
she wants the count of the total number
of ways you could get from one coin to

4184
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:57,780
of ways you could get from one coin to
 

4185
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,669
of ways you could get from one coin to
the other why you might ask why not

4186
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:01,679
the other why you might ask why not
 

4187
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,149
the other why you might ask why not
um okay so right so uh you know so for

4188
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:05,159
um okay so right so uh you know so for
 

4189
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:08,810
um okay so right so uh you know so for
instance maybe there's a mushroom

4190
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:08,820

 

4191
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:09,950

here

4192
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:09,960
here
 

4193
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,770
here
um now there's a quick path that gets

4194
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:12,780
um now there's a quick path that gets
 

4195
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,390
um now there's a quick path that gets
her there uh and collects one mushroom

4196
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:14,400
her there uh and collects one mushroom
 

4197
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,310
her there uh and collects one mushroom
so there's exactly one but maybe if

4198
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,320
so there's exactly one but maybe if
 

4199
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,930
so there's exactly one but maybe if
there's a mushroom

4200
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:17,940
there's a mushroom
 

4201
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:20,209
there's a mushroom
there uh

4202
01:19:20,209 --> 01:19:20,219
there uh
 

4203
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:22,910
there uh
well initially it feels like maybe she

4204
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:22,920
well initially it feels like maybe she
 

4205
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,590
well initially it feels like maybe she
could get two mushrooms right she could

4206
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:24,600
could get two mushrooms right she could
 

4207
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,689
could get two mushrooms right she could
go there go up pick up the second

4208
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:26,699
go there go up pick up the second
 

4209
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:28,430
go there go up pick up the second
mushroom and get back

4210
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:28,440
mushroom and get back
 

4211
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,110
mushroom and get back
but we're going to see that this quick

4212
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:30,120
but we're going to see that this quick
 

4213
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,750
but we're going to see that this quick
condition actually uh allows it doesn't

4214
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:32,760
condition actually uh allows it doesn't
 

4215
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,209
condition actually uh allows it doesn't
allow you to do that okay so in fact

4216
01:19:35,209 --> 01:19:35,219
allow you to do that okay so in fact
 

4217
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:37,550
allow you to do that okay so in fact
it'll turn out that quick paths can only

4218
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:37,560
it'll turn out that quick paths can only
 

4219
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,050
it'll turn out that quick paths can only
collect one Mushroom in this two three

4220
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:39,060
collect one Mushroom in this two three
 

4221
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,990
collect one Mushroom in this two three
by three case so there's the at least

4222
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,000
by three case so there's the at least
 

4223
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,090
by three case so there's the at least
two different paths

4224
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:44,100
two different paths
 

4225
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,189
two different paths
well there's one

4226
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:46,199
well there's one
 

4227
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,630
well there's one
two

4228
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:47,640
two
 

4229
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,850
two
three uh different ways that she could

4230
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:49,860
three uh different ways that she could
 

4231
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,410
three uh different ways that she could
collect one mushroom and have a quick

4232
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:51,420
collect one mushroom and have a quick
 

4233
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,850
collect one mushroom and have a quick
path

4234
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:52,860
path
 

4235
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,950
path
okay

4236
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:54,960
okay
 

4237
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,110
okay
so the first thing to notice uh your

4238
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,120
so the first thing to notice uh your
 

4239
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,090
so the first thing to notice uh your
search is a little bit sneaky

4240
01:19:59,090 --> 01:19:59,100
search is a little bit sneaky
 

4241
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,330
search is a little bit sneaky
by defining quick paths uh basically by

4242
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:02,340
by defining quick paths uh basically by
 

4243
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,970
by defining quick paths uh basically by
giving her no slack at all right

4244
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:04,980
giving her no slack at all right
 

4245
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:08,270
giving her no slack at all right
um and here's the basic observation

4246
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:08,280
um and here's the basic observation
 

4247
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,010
um and here's the basic observation
notice the in order to get from the

4248
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:10,020
notice the in order to get from the
 

4249
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,030
notice the in order to get from the
upper left to the bottom right she's

4250
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,040
upper left to the bottom right she's
 

4251
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,250
upper left to the bottom right she's
going to have to go down into the right

4252
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:13,260
going to have to go down into the right
 

4253
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,050
going to have to go down into the right
possibly she could also go up like she

4254
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:15,060
possibly she could also go up like she
 

4255
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,689
possibly she could also go up like she
could try and go around a tree

4256
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:17,699
could try and go around a tree
 

4257
01:20:17,699 --> 01:20:20,870
could try and go around a tree
but only plausibly uh and in particular

4258
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:20,880
but only plausibly uh and in particular
 

4259
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,370
but only plausibly uh and in particular
the question is how many times does she

4260
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:22,380
the question is how many times does she
 

4261
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,930
the question is how many times does she
have to go down and how many times does

4262
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:23,940
have to go down and how many times does
 

4263
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,430
have to go down and how many times does
she have to go to the right

4264
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
she have to go to the right
 

4265
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,110
she have to go to the right
well she has to get to the bottom of the

4266
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
well she has to get to the bottom of the
 

4267
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,910
well she has to get to the bottom of the
grid right so she's on grid square

4268
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:28,920
grid right so she's on grid square
 

4269
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,910
grid right so she's on grid square
number one just go down in this case at

4270
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:31,920
number one just go down in this case at
 

4271
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,290
number one just go down in this case at
least two more times so in general n

4272
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:33,300
least two more times so in general n
 

4273
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,669
least two more times so in general n
minus one times

4274
01:20:34,669 --> 01:20:34,679
minus one times
 

4275
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:36,590
minus one times
she has to go to the right

4276
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:36,600
she has to go to the right
 

4277
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,870
she has to go to the right
n minus one times

4278
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:38,880
n minus one times
 

4279
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,070
n minus one times
so what does that mean she has to make

4280
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,080
so what does that mean she has to make
 

4281
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,070
so what does that mean she has to make
two n minus two moves

4282
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:43,080
two n minus two moves
 

4283
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,110
two n minus two moves
and that's a lower bound right so if she

4284
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,120
and that's a lower bound right so if she
 

4285
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,610
and that's a lower bound right so if she
goes up she's going to have to go down

4286
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:46,620
goes up she's going to have to go down
 

4287
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:47,570
goes up she's going to have to go down
again so it's only going to make it

4288
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:47,580
again so it's only going to make it
 

4289
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,570
again so it's only going to make it
bigger right so at the very least she

4290
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:50,580
bigger right so at the very least she
 

4291
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:54,050
bigger right so at the very least she
has to do two n minus two

4292
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:54,060
has to do two n minus two
 

4293
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,610
has to do two n minus two
moves

4294
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:55,620
moves
 

4295
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:59,030
moves
you know down and right to get from the

4296
01:20:59,030 --> 01:20:59,040
you know down and right to get from the
 

4297
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,250
you know down and right to get from the
upper left to the lower right

4298
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:01,260
upper left to the lower right
 

4299
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,870
upper left to the lower right
how many squares does she touch when

4300
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
how many squares does she touch when
 

4301
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,490
how many squares does she touch when
she's doing that was the fence post

4302
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:04,500
she's doing that was the fence post
 

4303
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,050
she's doing that was the fence post
problem right so she made two n minus

4304
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:06,060
problem right so she made two n minus
 

4305
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,270
problem right so she made two n minus
two moves and she had a place where she

4306
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:08,280
two moves and she had a place where she
 

4307
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,290
two moves and she had a place where she
started

4308
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:09,300
started
 

4309
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,229
started
um that implies that just by moving down

4310
01:21:12,229 --> 01:21:12,239
um that implies that just by moving down
 

4311
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:15,290
um that implies that just by moving down
into the right she makes two n minus one

4312
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:15,300
into the right she makes two n minus one
 

4313
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,149
into the right she makes two n minus one
squares

4314
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:17,159
squares
 

4315
01:21:17,159 --> 01:21:20,030
squares
she touches rather

4316
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:20,040
she touches rather
 

4317
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,370
she touches rather
so can she ever move up

4318
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:22,380
so can she ever move up
 

4319
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,590
so can she ever move up
no could she ever move to the left

4320
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:24,600
no could she ever move to the left
 

4321
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,330
no could she ever move to the left
no

4322
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:26,340
no
 

4323
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,070
no
and that basically is all you need to

4324
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:28,080
and that basically is all you need to
 

4325
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,850
and that basically is all you need to
solve this problem the rest of it's

4326
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:28,860
solve this problem the rest of it's
 

4327
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,950
solve this problem the rest of it's
actually pretty easy right so so the

4328
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
actually pretty easy right so so the
 

4329
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,570
actually pretty easy right so so the
basic observation here is you can only

4330
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:32,580
basic observation here is you can only
 

4331
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:34,370
basic observation here is you can only
move down and to the right because she

4332
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:34,380
move down and to the right because she
 

4333
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,930
move down and to the right because she
moved up or to the left her path would

4334
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:35,940
moved up or to the left her path would
 

4335
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:37,790
moved up or to the left her path would
no longer be called quick uh and that

4336
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:37,800
no longer be called quick uh and that
 

4337
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,250
no longer be called quick uh and that
would be a problem moreover every path

4338
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:40,260
would be a problem moreover every path
 

4339
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,169
would be a problem moreover every path
that moves down into the right is a

4340
01:21:42,169 --> 01:21:42,179
that moves down into the right is a
 

4341
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:43,729
that moves down into the right is a
quick path

4342
01:21:43,729 --> 01:21:43,739
quick path
 

4343
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:45,590
quick path
assuming she was just their target and

4344
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
assuming she was just their target and
 

4345
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,910
assuming she was just their target and
doesn't hit a tree

4346
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:46,920
doesn't hit a tree
 

4347
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,649
doesn't hit a tree
okay

4348
01:21:48,649 --> 01:21:48,659
okay
 

4349
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:50,689
okay
um so that's the basic observation and

4350
01:21:50,689 --> 01:21:50,699
um so that's the basic observation and
 

4351
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:52,070
um so that's the basic observation and
notice that that already basically

4352
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,080
notice that that already basically
 

4353
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,290
notice that that already basically
suggests it's like screaming out to you

4354
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:54,300
suggests it's like screaming out to you
 

4355
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,910
suggests it's like screaming out to you
how to do dynamic programming because

4356
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:55,920
how to do dynamic programming because
 

4357
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,030
how to do dynamic programming because
literally you have a table

4358
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
literally you have a table
 

4359
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,130
literally you have a table
looking at you on the Blackboard right

4360
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:01,140
looking at you on the Blackboard right
 

4361
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,290
looking at you on the Blackboard right
now and you have an ordering like down

4362
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:03,300
now and you have an ordering like down
 

4363
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,850
now and you have an ordering like down
into the right the the the the the the

4364
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:04,860
into the right the the the the the the
 

4365

is acyclic yeah

4366
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,440
is acyclic yeah
 

4367
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,410
is acyclic yeah
okay have I flammed on the board enough

4368
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:09,420
okay have I flammed on the board enough
 

4369
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,030
okay have I flammed on the board enough
times the first time I taught at

4370
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,040
times the first time I taught at
 

4371
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,130
times the first time I taught at
Stanford they I got negative course

4372
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:13,140
Stanford they I got negative course
 

4373
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,750
Stanford they I got negative course
feedback that I had too much coffee and

4374
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:14,760
feedback that I had too much coffee and
 

4375
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,070
feedback that I had too much coffee and
was slamming on the board a lot

4376
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
was slamming on the board a lot
 

4377
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,630
was slamming on the board a lot
apparently

4378
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:17,640
apparently
 

4379
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,669
apparently
um I watched the video later and indeed

4380
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:19,679
um I watched the video later and indeed
 

4381
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:20,990
um I watched the video later and indeed
that was not wrong

4382
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:21,000
that was not wrong
 

4383
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,189
that was not wrong
okay

4384
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:22,199
okay
 

4385
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:27,169
okay
so uh right so uh we're going to call K

4386
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:27,179
so uh right so uh we're going to call K
 

4387
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:29,990
so uh right so uh we're going to call K
this is going to be the sort of the max

4388
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
this is going to be the sort of the max
 

4389
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,530
this is going to be the sort of the max
mushrooms

4390
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:33,540

 

4391
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,990

she can get going on on the entire path

4392
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,000
she can get going on on the entire path
 

4393
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,610
she can get going on on the entire path
in the upper left to the lower right so

4394
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:37,620
in the upper left to the lower right so
 

4395
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,870
in the upper left to the lower right so
we want to know the number of Quick

4396
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
we want to know the number of Quick
 

4397
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,169
we want to know the number of Quick
paths that can achieve this number kit

4398
01:22:42,169 --> 01:22:42,179
paths that can achieve this number kit
 

4399
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:45,229
paths that can achieve this number kit
okay so let's do sort by

4400
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:45,239
okay so let's do sort by
 

4401
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:48,350
okay so let's do sort by
really fast because I got four minutes

4402
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:48,360
really fast because I got four minutes
 

4403
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,669
really fast because I got four minutes
actually a tiny bit more than that

4404
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:49,679
actually a tiny bit more than that
 

4405
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,169
actually a tiny bit more than that
because we started late

4406
01:22:51,169 --> 01:22:51,179
because we started late
 

4407
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:54,790
because we started late
okay so uh

4408
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:54,800

 

4409
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,130

now the kind of annoyance here is that

4410
01:22:58,130 --> 01:22:58,140
now the kind of annoyance here is that
 

4411
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,810
now the kind of annoyance here is that
there's two different numbers that we

4412
01:22:59,810 --> 01:22:59,820
there's two different numbers that we
 

4413
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:02,330
there's two different numbers that we
don't know right one of them is K and

4414
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:02,340
don't know right one of them is K and
 

4415
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,649
don't know right one of them is K and
the other is the number of paths right

4416
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:03,659
the other is the number of paths right
 

4417
01:23:03,659 --> 01:23:05,270
the other is the number of paths right
like the problem didn't tell you how

4418
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
like the problem didn't tell you how
 

4419
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,189
like the problem didn't tell you how
many mushrooms she can pick up it does

4420
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:07,199
many mushrooms she can pick up it does
 

4421
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,169
many mushrooms she can pick up it does
tell you that there's some path to get

4422
01:23:09,169 --> 01:23:09,179
tell you that there's some path to get
 

4423
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:10,310
tell you that there's some path to get
from the upper left to the bottom right

4424
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:10,320
from the upper left to the bottom right
 

4425
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,750
from the upper left to the bottom right
there's not just like a row of trees

4426
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:11,760
there's not just like a row of trees
 

4427
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,370
there's not just like a row of trees
somewhere

4428
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:13,380
somewhere
 

4429
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,450
somewhere
um

4430
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:14,460
um
 

4431
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,570
um
which I feel on my commute sometimes

4432
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:17,580
which I feel on my commute sometimes
 

4433
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,430
which I feel on my commute sometimes
but uh

4434
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:19,440
but uh
 

4435
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,709
but uh
it doesn't tell you you know the number

4436
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:21,719
it doesn't tell you you know the number
 

4437
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:23,390
it doesn't tell you you know the number
that she has to accomplish

4438
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:23,400
that she has to accomplish
 

4439
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,370
that she has to accomplish
um and and initially that's that's kind

4440
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:25,380
um and and initially that's that's kind
 

4441
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,290
um and and initially that's that's kind
of annoying so maybe the first thing

4442
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:27,300
of annoying so maybe the first thing
 

4443
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,970
of annoying so maybe the first thing
that we do is just compute K like the

4444
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:28,980
that we do is just compute K like the
 

4445
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:31,550
that we do is just compute K like the
maximum number of mushrooms that she can

4446
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:31,560
maximum number of mushrooms that she can
 

4447
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,610
maximum number of mushrooms that she can
collect on any quick path

4448
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:34,620
collect on any quick path
 

4449
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,050
collect on any quick path
and then we go back and compute that

4450
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:36,060
and then we go back and compute that
 

4451
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,729
and then we go back and compute that
other account yeah because that would be

4452
01:23:37,729 --> 01:23:37,739
other account yeah because that would be
 

4453
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:39,050
other account yeah because that would be
one problem-solving approach so that we

4454
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:39,060
one problem-solving approach so that we
 

4455
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,270
one problem-solving approach so that we
could think about a little bit

4456
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
could think about a little bit
 

4457
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,290
could think about a little bit
um so in particular uh let's define

4458
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:45,300
um so in particular uh let's define
 

4459
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:46,910
um so in particular uh let's define
okay

4460
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:46,920
okay
 

4461
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,590
okay
i j

4462
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:48,600

4463
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,110

to be equal to well we can generalize

4464
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:51,120
to be equal to well we can generalize
 

4465
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,270
to be equal to well we can generalize
our problem slightly and say what is the

4466
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,280
our problem slightly and say what is the
 

4467
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,950
our problem slightly and say what is the
number of mushrooms that I can get on

4468
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:54,960
number of mushrooms that I can get on
 

4469
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,530
number of mushrooms that I can get on
any kind of rectangle embedded inside of

4470
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:57,540
any kind of rectangle embedded inside of
 

4471
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,870
any kind of rectangle embedded inside of
my full problem right so in other words

4472
01:23:59,870 --> 01:23:59,880
my full problem right so in other words
 

4473
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,270
my full problem right so in other words
this is the max

4474
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:02,280
this is the max
 

4475
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:08,630
this is the max
number of mushrooms or M's for short on

4476
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:08,640
number of mushrooms or M's for short on
 

4477
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,390
number of mushrooms or M's for short on
a quick

4478
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:11,400
a quick
 

4479
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,490
a quick
path

4480
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:13,500
path
 

4481
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,550
path
to i j so in other words she always

4482
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
to i j so in other words she always
 

4483
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,050
to i j so in other words she always
starts in the upper left but now she

4484
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:18,060
starts in the upper left but now she
 

4485
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,030
starts in the upper left but now she
stops at any other grid cell

4486
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:20,040
stops at any other grid cell
 

4487
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,890
stops at any other grid cell
okay

4488
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:21,900
okay
 

4489
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,450
okay
uh

4490
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:23,460
uh
 

4491
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,149
uh
because I'm running low on time

4492
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159
because I'm running low on time
 

4493
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,709
because I'm running low on time
no I'm going to do this the way I want

4494
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:27,719
no I'm going to do this the way I want
 

4495
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:29,030
no I'm going to do this the way I want
to do this no so we're just going to

4496
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
to do this no so we're just going to
 

4497
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,530
to do this no so we're just going to
think about okay yeah

4498
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:30,540
think about okay yeah
 

4499
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:33,530
think about okay yeah
so the question is could we

4500
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:33,540
so the question is could we
 

4501
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,810
so the question is could we
compute Justice value K which certainly

4502
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:35,820
compute Justice value K which certainly
 

4503
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,510
compute Justice value K which certainly
seems convenient like like you know

4504
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:38,520
seems convenient like like you know
 

4505
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,390
seems convenient like like you know
Princess uh Plum really she might as

4506
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:41,400
Princess uh Plum really she might as
 

4507
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,410
Princess uh Plum really she might as
well know her anime she might as well

4508
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:42,420
well know her anime she might as well
 

4509
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,490
well know her anime she might as well
know the number of mushrooms she's

4510
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:43,500
know the number of mushrooms she's
 

4511
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,990
know the number of mushrooms she's
targeting if she can if she can get it

4512
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:45,000
targeting if she can if she can get it
 

4513
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,310
targeting if she can if she can get it
right

4514
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:46,320
right
 

4515
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,570
right
um

4516
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:47,580
um
 

4517
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:51,169
um
so how could we do this uh

4518
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:51,179
so how could we do this uh
 

4519
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:53,750
so how could we do this uh
recursively

4520
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:53,760
recursively
 

4521
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:58,070
recursively
well she has to get to position i j

4522
01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:58,080
well she has to get to position i j
 

4523
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,649
well she has to get to position i j
and from our argument up there she has

4524
01:25:00,649 --> 01:25:00,659
and from our argument up there she has
 

4525
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:02,450
and from our argument up there she has
to get there by either coming from up or

4526
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:02,460
to get there by either coming from up or
 

4527
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,310
to get there by either coming from up or
to the left

4528
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:04,320
to the left
 

4529
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,810
to the left
right the way we've chosen to write down

4530
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:05,820
right the way we've chosen to write down
 

4531
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,010
right the way we've chosen to write down
this problem

4532
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:07,020
this problem
 

4533
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,510
this problem
so

4534
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:08,520
so
 

4535
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,370
so
what are our different cases well first

4536
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:10,380
what are our different cases well first
 

4537
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,050
what are our different cases well first
of all if there's a tree

4538
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:12,060
of all if there's a tree
 

4539
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,490
of all if there's a tree
you can't do a damn thing right she

4540
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:13,500
you can't do a damn thing right she
 

4541
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,689
you can't do a damn thing right she
shouldn't even be able to get there yeah

4542
01:25:14,689 --> 01:25:14,699
shouldn't even be able to get there yeah
 

4543
01:25:14,699 --> 01:25:16,490
shouldn't even be able to get there yeah
and for convenience uh we're gonna find

4544
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:16,500
and for convenience uh we're gonna find
 

4545
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,890
and for convenience uh we're gonna find
You could argue that it's zero um we're

4546
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:18,900
You could argue that it's zero um we're
 

4547
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,510
You could argue that it's zero um we're
going to mark this as with a special

4548
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:20,520
going to mark this as with a special
 

4549
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,770
going to mark this as with a special
number and we'll see that that makes our

4550
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:21,780
number and we'll see that that makes our
 

4551
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,630
number and we'll see that that makes our
notation a little convenient

4552
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:23,640
notation a little convenient
 

4553
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:28,370
notation a little convenient
um so one is if there exists a tree

4554
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:28,380
um so one is if there exists a tree
 

4555
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:32,390
um so one is if there exists a tree
then we're going to say k i j is minus

4556
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
then we're going to say k i j is minus
 

4557
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,070
then we're going to say k i j is minus
infinity again there's a philosophical

4558
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,080
infinity again there's a philosophical
 

4559
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,510
infinity again there's a philosophical
question there does she get minus

4560
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
question there does she get minus
 

4561
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,669
question there does she get minus
infinity mushrooms if she is standing on

4562
01:25:37,669 --> 01:25:37,679
infinity mushrooms if she is standing on
 

4563
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:38,930
infinity mushrooms if she is standing on
top of a tree I don't know because she

4564
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:38,940
top of a tree I don't know because she
 

4565
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:40,729
top of a tree I don't know because she
shouldn't stand on top of a tree but at

4566
01:25:40,729 --> 01:25:40,739
shouldn't stand on top of a tree but at
 

4567
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:42,169
shouldn't stand on top of a tree but at
least it's it's going to let us know

4568
01:25:42,169 --> 01:25:42,179
least it's it's going to let us know
 

4569
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,490
least it's it's going to let us know
that something went wrong in this grid

4570
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:43,500
that something went wrong in this grid
 

4571
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,050
that something went wrong in this grid
Square in the other parts of our

4572
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:45,060
Square in the other parts of our
 

4573
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:48,050
Square in the other parts of our
recursion okay

4574
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:48,060
recursion okay
 

4575
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,530
recursion okay
um and otherwise

4576
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:51,540

 

4577
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,169

well what are our different uh

4578
01:25:54,169 --> 01:25:54,179
well what are our different uh
 

4579
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:57,709
well what are our different uh
cases here well she always picks up a

4580
01:25:57,709 --> 01:25:57,719
cases here well she always picks up a
 

4581
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:58,910
cases here well she always picks up a
mushroom if it's there she might as well

4582
01:25:58,910 --> 01:25:58,920
mushroom if it's there she might as well
 

4583
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,950
mushroom if it's there she might as well
she's maximizing yeah in fact I think

4584
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:00,960
she's maximizing yeah in fact I think
 

4585
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,970
she's maximizing yeah in fact I think
the problem even says that she's she's

4586
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:01,980
the problem even says that she's she's
 

4587
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,410
the problem even says that she's she's
like really new mushroom she like

4588
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:03,420
like really new mushroom she like
 

4589
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,870
like really new mushroom she like
collects them automatically right

4590
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:05,880
collects them automatically right
 

4591
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:10,610
collects them automatically right
um so uh what do we get

4592
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:10,620

 

4593
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,709

I'll use unnecessarily fancy notation

4594
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719
I'll use unnecessarily fancy notation
 

4595
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,310
I'll use unnecessarily fancy notation
this is an indicator of uh whether there

4596
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:16,320
this is an indicator of uh whether there
 

4597
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,129
this is an indicator of uh whether there
exists a mushroom

4598
01:26:19,129 --> 01:26:19,139
exists a mushroom
 

4599
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:24,110
exists a mushroom
at position i j

4600
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:24,120

 

4601
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,430

right

4602
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:25,440
right
 

4603
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,290
right
um meaning this is a one if there is and

4604
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:27,300
um meaning this is a one if there is and
 

4605
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,850
um meaning this is a one if there is and
there's a zero if there's not

4606
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:28,860
there's a zero if there's not
 

4607
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:31,910
there's a zero if there's not
uh sometimes this is a indicated with a

4608
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:31,920
uh sometimes this is a indicated with a
 

4609
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,490
uh sometimes this is a indicated with a
one with a little subscript but whatever

4610
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:34,500
one with a little subscript but whatever
 

4611
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,930
one with a little subscript but whatever
um and in addition to that she might

4612
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:35,940
um and in addition to that she might
 

4613
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,750
um and in addition to that she might
have picked up mushrooms along paths and

4614
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:38,760
have picked up mushrooms along paths and
 

4615
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,209
have picked up mushrooms along paths and
we know that her path to position i j

4616
01:26:41,209 --> 01:26:41,219
we know that her path to position i j
 

4617
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:43,910
we know that her path to position i j
either came from up or to the left

4618
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:43,920
either came from up or to the left
 

4619
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:50,030
either came from up or to the left
right so uh in other words we know

4620
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:50,040

 

4621
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,250

that she could have gotten the Max from

4622
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:52,260
that she could have gotten the Max from
 

4623
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,350
that she could have gotten the Max from
any path ending a buffer or any path to

4624
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:54,360
any path ending a buffer or any path to
 

4625
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:59,570
any path ending a buffer or any path to
the left of her so that's k i minus 1 J

4626
01:26:59,570 --> 01:26:59,580
the left of her so that's k i minus 1 J
 

4627
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:03,530
the left of her so that's k i minus 1 J
which I guess is to the left and k i

4628
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:03,540
which I guess is to the left and k i
 

4629
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:07,070
which I guess is to the left and k i
J minus one like that

4630
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:07,080
J minus one like that
 

4631
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,530
J minus one like that
and this can be used to fill in our

4632
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:09,540
and this can be used to fill in our
 

4633
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,689
and this can be used to fill in our
whole table of K values

4634
01:27:11,689 --> 01:27:11,699
whole table of K values
 

4635
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:13,490
whole table of K values
in fact since I'm low on time I'll let

4636
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:13,500
in fact since I'm low on time I'll let
 

4637
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,970
in fact since I'm low on time I'll let
you do the t-bot

4638
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:16,980
you do the t-bot
 

4639
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,709
you do the t-bot
for the remainder of this problem right

4640
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
for the remainder of this problem right
 

4641
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,390
for the remainder of this problem right
essentially I think the key observation

4642
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,400
essentially I think the key observation
 

4643
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,610
essentially I think the key observation
is this one right obviously when she

4644
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:22,620
is this one right obviously when she
 

4645
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:23,930
is this one right obviously when she
starts in the upper left we get zero

4646
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:23,940
starts in the upper left we get zero
 

4647
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,129
starts in the upper left we get zero
mushrooms because she's not standing on

4648
01:27:25,129 --> 01:27:25,139
mushrooms because she's not standing on
 

4649
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,110
mushrooms because she's not standing on
top of one the problem says that

4650
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,120
top of one the problem says that
 

4651
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,910
top of one the problem says that
and this allows us to fill in our whole

4652
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:28,920
and this allows us to fill in our whole
 

4653
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,229
and this allows us to fill in our whole
table k

4654
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:30,239
table k
 

4655
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,270
table k
so in particular this gives us our enemy

4656
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:32,280
so in particular this gives us our enemy
 

4657
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,870
so in particular this gives us our enemy
now we now know how many uh

4658
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:35,880
now we now know how many uh
 

4659
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,669
now we now know how many uh
mushrooms she should have at every step

4660
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
mushrooms she should have at every step
 

4661
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,229
mushrooms she should have at every step
of her journey in fact it tells us a

4662
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:39,239
of her journey in fact it tells us a
 

4663
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:41,330
of her journey in fact it tells us a
tiny bit more than that right because it

4664
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:41,340
tiny bit more than that right because it
 

4665
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,790
tiny bit more than that right because it
says if I'm at this grid scale at this

4666
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:43,800
says if I'm at this grid scale at this
 

4667
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,490
says if I'm at this grid scale at this
particular grid Square during my path I

4668
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:46,500
particular grid Square during my path I
 

4669
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,930
particular grid Square during my path I
should have this many mushrooms if I

4670
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:47,940
should have this many mushrooms if I
 

4671
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:48,950
should have this many mushrooms if I
didn't then something else something

4672
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960
didn't then something else something
 

4673
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:49,850
didn't then something else something
went wrong

4674
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:49,860
went wrong
 

4675
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:51,470
went wrong
yeah

4676
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:51,480
yeah
 

4677
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,850
yeah
um so the way that the solution is

4678
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:52,860
um so the way that the solution is
 

4679
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,229
um so the way that the solution is
written they do two pieces of the

4680
01:27:54,229 --> 01:27:54,239
written they do two pieces of the
 

4681
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,030
written they do two pieces of the
recursion and once you actually could

4682
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:56,040
recursion and once you actually could
 

4683
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,770
recursion and once you actually could
have just solved for this K Matrix first

4684
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:57,780
have just solved for this K Matrix first
 

4685
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:59,330
have just solved for this K Matrix first
and then gone back and done the second

4686
01:27:59,330 --> 01:27:59,340
and then gone back and done the second
 

4687
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,129
and then gone back and done the second
half with this problem and those are are

4688
01:28:01,129 --> 01:28:01,139
half with this problem and those are are
 

4689
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:03,530
half with this problem and those are are
exactly the same yeah and and when I was

4690
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:03,540
exactly the same yeah and and when I was
 

4691
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:05,090
exactly the same yeah and and when I was
writing my solution this is the way I

4692
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:05,100
writing my solution this is the way I
 

4693
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:06,950
writing my solution this is the way I
thought about it because somehow I kind

4694
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
thought about it because somehow I kind
 

4695
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,850
thought about it because somehow I kind
of thought like she might as well know

4696
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:07,860
of thought like she might as well know
 

4697
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,350
of thought like she might as well know
how many mushrooms she wants to collect

4698
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:09,360
how many mushrooms she wants to collect
 

4699
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,729
how many mushrooms she wants to collect
before she starts counting paths that's

4700
01:28:10,729 --> 01:28:10,739
before she starts counting paths that's
 

4701
01:28:10,739 --> 01:28:13,669
before she starts counting paths that's
like a secondary question you know

4702
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:13,679
like a secondary question you know
 

4703
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,350
like a secondary question you know
um and and so this is one way to do it

4704
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:15,360
um and and so this is one way to do it
 

4705
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,709
um and and so this is one way to do it
so in our remaining negative two minutes

4706
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
so in our remaining negative two minutes
 

4707
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:20,209
so in our remaining negative two minutes
um let's think about the recursion for

4708
01:28:20,209 --> 01:28:20,219
um let's think about the recursion for
 

4709
01:28:20,219 --> 01:28:22,010
um let's think about the recursion for
computing remember that we want to know

4710
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:22,020
computing remember that we want to know
 

4711
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:25,729
computing remember that we want to know
the number of paths needed to collect

4712
01:28:25,729 --> 01:28:25,739
the number of paths needed to collect
 

4713
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:28,669
the number of paths needed to collect
that many mushrooms uh the maximum

4714
01:28:28,669 --> 01:28:28,679
that many mushrooms uh the maximum
 

4715
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:31,669
that many mushrooms uh the maximum
number of mushrooms

4716
01:28:31,669 --> 01:28:31,679

 

4717
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,169

please let there not be a whole lot of

4718
01:28:33,169 --> 01:28:33,179
please let there not be a whole lot of
 

4719
01:28:33,179 --> 01:28:35,209
please let there not be a whole lot of
stuff on this board ah there's not any

4720
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:35,219
stuff on this board ah there's not any
 

4721
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:38,149
stuff on this board ah there's not any
stuff on this board it's great okay

4722
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:38,159
stuff on this board it's great okay
 

4723
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,550
stuff on this board it's great okay
um so in particular

4724
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
um so in particular
 

4725
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,649
um so in particular
now I'm going to define a second thing

4726
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:42,659
now I'm going to define a second thing
 

4727
01:28:42,659 --> 01:28:44,149
now I'm going to define a second thing
that I also am going to do dynamic

4728
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:44,159
that I also am going to do dynamic
 

4729
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,070
that I also am going to do dynamic
programming on yeah I'm going to say

4730
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080
programming on yeah I'm going to say
 

4731
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,030
programming on yeah I'm going to say
that x i j

4732
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:50,040
that x i j
 

4733
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,250
that x i j
is equal to and I'm going to make a kind

4734
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:52,260
is equal to and I'm going to make a kind
 

4735
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:55,669
is equal to and I'm going to make a kind
of a sneaky definition uh here which is

4736
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:55,679
of a sneaky definition uh here which is
 

4737
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:02,750
of a sneaky definition uh here which is
the number of Quick Pass

4738
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:02,760

 

4739
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:10,550

um that end at IJ

4740
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:10,560

 

4741
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,229

with

4742
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:12,239
with
 

4743
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:15,110
with
now let's anticipate our problem a

4744
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:15,120
now let's anticipate our problem a
 

4745
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,030
now let's anticipate our problem a
little bit so at the end of the day

4746
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,040
little bit so at the end of the day
 

4747
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,890
little bit so at the end of the day
we're going to do like X of n comma n

4748
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:18,900
we're going to do like X of n comma n
 

4749
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,090
we're going to do like X of n comma n
because she wants to end up all the way

4750
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:20,100
because she wants to end up all the way
 

4751
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,189
because she wants to end up all the way
down to the right and how many mushrooms

4752
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:22,199
down to the right and how many mushrooms
 

4753
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:23,390
down to the right and how many mushrooms
does she want to have now that we know

4754
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:23,400
does she want to have now that we know
 

4755
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,229
does she want to have now that we know
okay

4756
01:29:24,229 --> 01:29:24,239
okay
 

4757
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,970
okay
she wants to have K of n comma n

4758
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:25,980
she wants to have K of n comma n
 

4759
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,709
she wants to have K of n comma n
mushrooms

4760
01:29:27,709 --> 01:29:27,719
mushrooms
 

4761
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:29,750
mushrooms
along the way

4762
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:29,760
along the way
 

4763
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,370
along the way
it would be kind of ambitious if she

4764
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:31,380
it would be kind of ambitious if she
 

4765
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,290
it would be kind of ambitious if she
wanted to have K of n comma n mushrooms

4766
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:33,300
wanted to have K of n comma n mushrooms
 

4767
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,970
wanted to have K of n comma n mushrooms
the entire path

4768
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:34,980
the entire path
 

4769
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,350
the entire path
um but it would be slightly less

4770
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:36,360
um but it would be slightly less
 

4771
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:41,090
um but it would be slightly less
ambitious to have K of i j mushrooms

4772
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:41,100
ambitious to have K of i j mushrooms
 

4773
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,310
ambitious to have K of i j mushrooms
because somehow that's exactly what we

4774
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:43,320
because somehow that's exactly what we
 

4775
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,530
because somehow that's exactly what we
we just uh constructed in in the

4776
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:45,540
we just uh constructed in in the
 

4777
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,930
we just uh constructed in in the
previous thing was path right

4778
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:47,940
previous thing was path right
 

4779
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,450
previous thing was path right
so well the last guy looks like a Max

4780
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:50,460
so well the last guy looks like a Max
 

4781
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,770
so well the last guy looks like a Max
now we're going to expect to see some

4782
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:51,780
now we're going to expect to see some
 

4783
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:52,970
now we're going to expect to see some
plus signs here because we're like

4784
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:52,980
plus signs here because we're like
 

4785
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,370
plus signs here because we're like
adding up how many paths we have okay

4786
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:55,380
adding up how many paths we have okay
 

4787
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,649
adding up how many paths we have okay
and now let's come up with our recursive

4788
01:29:57,649 --> 01:29:57,659
and now let's come up with our recursive
 

4789
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,810
and now let's come up with our recursive
rule for for this uh array X and then

4790
01:29:59,810 --> 01:29:59,820
rule for for this uh array X and then
 

4791
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:02,030
rule for for this uh array X and then
we'll we'll call it a day so in

4792
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:02,040
we'll we'll call it a day so in
 

4793
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,950
we'll we'll call it a day so in
particular

4794
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:03,960
particular
 

4795
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:10,850
particular
gun one if there's a tree

4796
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:10,860

 

4797
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,649

how many paths are there

4798
01:30:12,649 --> 01:30:12,659
how many paths are there
 

4799
01:30:12,659 --> 01:30:14,810
how many paths are there
there are no paths because I can't get

4800
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:14,820
there are no paths because I can't get
 

4801
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:18,110
there are no paths because I can't get
there yeah so then I J

4802
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:18,120
there yeah so then I J
 

4803
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,729
there yeah so then I J
equals zero

4804
01:30:19,729 --> 01:30:19,739
equals zero
 

4805
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:23,390
equals zero
okay otherwise there ain't a treat

4806
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:23,400
okay otherwise there ain't a treat
 

4807
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,830
okay otherwise there ain't a treat
and now I have to be a little careful

4808
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:24,840
and now I have to be a little careful
 

4809
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,629
and now I have to be a little careful
right

4810
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:26,639
right
 

4811
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:27,709
right
um

4812
01:30:27,709 --> 01:30:27,719
um
 

4813
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:29,570
um
so I'm going to write this like a little

4814
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:29,580
so I'm going to write this like a little
 

4815
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:30,770
so I'm going to write this like a little
piece of code

4816
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:30,780
piece of code
 

4817
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,270
piece of code
um you could have written this as a

4818
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:32,280
um you could have written this as a
 

4819
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,490
um you could have written this as a
giant Max instead and there are a bunch

4820
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:34,500
giant Max instead and there are a bunch
 

4821
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,209
giant Max instead and there are a bunch
of cases uh and and whatever so let's

4822
01:30:38,209 --> 01:30:38,219
of cases uh and and whatever so let's
 

4823
01:30:38,219 --> 01:30:40,189
of cases uh and and whatever so let's
think about it like a piece of code so

4824
01:30:40,189 --> 01:30:40,199
think about it like a piece of code so
 

4825
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:42,290
think about it like a piece of code so
initially I think there are no paths

4826
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:42,300
initially I think there are no paths
 

4827
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,270
initially I think there are no paths
that get me kij mushrooms that's

4828
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:44,280
that get me kij mushrooms that's
 

4829
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,070
that get me kij mushrooms that's
perfectly fine

4830
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
perfectly fine
 

4831
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,450
perfectly fine
and remember we're going to keep

4832
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:47,460
and remember we're going to keep
 

4833
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:48,950
and remember we're going to keep
applying the same piece of logic which

4834
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:48,960
applying the same piece of logic which
 

4835
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,450
applying the same piece of logic which
is that a path can only come from to the

4836
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:50,460
is that a path can only come from to the
 

4837
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:53,810
is that a path can only come from to the
left and up and let's uh think about

4838
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:53,820
left and up and let's uh think about
 

4839
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:55,729
left and up and let's uh think about
those two cases

4840
01:30:55,729 --> 01:30:55,739
those two cases
 

4841
01:30:55,739 --> 01:30:56,570
those two cases
um

4842
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:56,580
um
 

4843
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:58,850
um
and by the way we're going to use Chi to

4844
01:30:58,850 --> 01:30:58,860
and by the way we're going to use Chi to
 

4845
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,910
and by the way we're going to use Chi to
equal this Chi of stuff that that we had

4846
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:01,920
equal this Chi of stuff that that we had
 

4847
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,490
equal this Chi of stuff that that we had
in the previous expression right

4848
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:04,500
in the previous expression right
 

4849
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,530
in the previous expression right
um so Chi is one if there's a mushroom

4850
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:06,540
um so Chi is one if there's a mushroom
 

4851
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:09,530
um so Chi is one if there's a mushroom
at this place and zero if there is not

4852
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:09,540
at this place and zero if there is not
 

4853
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:12,290
at this place and zero if there is not
okay

4854
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:12,300

 

4855
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,590

so my path can come from the left or up

4856
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:15,600
so my path can come from the left or up
 

4857
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,770
so my path can come from the left or up
I know that it can't come from Up

4858
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:18,780
I know that it can't come from Up
 

4859
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,570
I know that it can't come from Up
if the number of mushrooms that I got

4860
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:20,580
if the number of mushrooms that I got
 

4861
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,590
if the number of mushrooms that I got
from Up

4862
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:21,600
from Up
 

4863
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,570
from Up
plus potentially the one that I got here

4864
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:23,580
plus potentially the one that I got here
 

4865
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,189
plus potentially the one that I got here
doesn't align with the number of

4866
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:25,199
doesn't align with the number of
 

4867
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,770
doesn't align with the number of
mushrooms that I should have by the kij

4868
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:27,780
mushrooms that I should have by the kij
 

4869
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:30,590
mushrooms that I should have by the kij
standard that I have set for myself

4870
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:30,600
standard that I have set for myself
 

4871
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,570
standard that I have set for myself
yeah so if I if I want to write that out

4872
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:32,580
yeah so if I if I want to write that out
 

4873
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:36,470
yeah so if I if I want to write that out
in code uh the way I do that is I say if

4874
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:36,480
in code uh the way I do that is I say if
 

4875
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,050
in code uh the way I do that is I say if
um K of so let's say I look to the left

4876
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:39,060
um K of so let's say I look to the left
 

4877
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,669
um K of so let's say I look to the left
first

4878
01:31:40,669 --> 01:31:40,679
first
 

4879
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:42,110
first
you know this is like you know look to

4880
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:42,120
you know this is like you know look to
 

4881
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,310
you know this is like you know look to
your left look to your right one of you

4882
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:43,320
your left look to your right one of you
 

4883
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,490
your left look to your right one of you
will pass this exam kind of scenario and

4884
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:46,500
will pass this exam kind of scenario and
 

4885
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,010
will pass this exam kind of scenario and
I potentially add a mushroom at my

4886
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:49,020
I potentially add a mushroom at my
 

4887
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:52,129
I potentially add a mushroom at my
current position if there is one

4888
01:31:52,129 --> 01:31:52,139
current position if there is one
 

4889
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:55,370
current position if there is one
if that is equal to k i j well what does

4890
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:55,380
if that is equal to k i j well what does
 

4891
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,810
if that is equal to k i j well what does
that mean that means that path that went

4892
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:56,820
that mean that means that path that went
 

4893
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,370
that mean that means that path that went
to the left were able to collect the

4894
01:31:58,370 --> 01:31:58,380
to the left were able to collect the
 

4895
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,229
to the left were able to collect the
number of mushrooms I need to get to the

4896
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:00,239
number of mushrooms I need to get to the
 

4897
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:06,350
number of mushrooms I need to get to the
position I am now so now I can add

4898
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:06,360

 

4899
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,450

what well all of the different ways

4900
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:08,460
what well all of the different ways
 

4901
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,970
what well all of the different ways
maybe I'll do a plus equals

4902
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:10,980
maybe I'll do a plus equals
 

4903
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,350
maybe I'll do a plus equals
X of

4904
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:12,360
X of
 

4905
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:16,129
X of
I minus 1 J right because any path that

4906
01:32:16,129 --> 01:32:16,139
I minus 1 J right because any path that
 

4907
01:32:16,139 --> 01:32:17,510
I minus 1 J right because any path that
got to the previous guy and clicked the

4908
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:17,520
got to the previous guy and clicked the
 

4909
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,189
got to the previous guy and clicked the
right number of mushrooms can now reach

4910
01:32:19,189 --> 01:32:19,199
right number of mushrooms can now reach
 

4911
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:20,990
right number of mushrooms can now reach
me and get the right number of mushrooms

4912
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:21,000
me and get the right number of mushrooms
 

4913
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,330
me and get the right number of mushrooms
and similarly I can look up and do

4914
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:23,340
and similarly I can look up and do
 

4915
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:27,350
and similarly I can look up and do
exactly the same logic so if K of i j

4916
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:27,360
exactly the same logic so if K of i j
 

4917
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:31,490
exactly the same logic so if K of i j
minus 1 plus this number is equal to k i

4918
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:31,500
minus 1 plus this number is equal to k i
 

4919
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,990
minus 1 plus this number is equal to k i
j

4920
01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:33,000
j
 

4921
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,890
j
then x i j

4922
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:36,900
then x i j
 

4923
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,629
then x i j
gets an additional

4924
01:32:38,629 --> 01:32:38,639
gets an additional
 

4925
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,649
gets an additional
number of paths

4926
01:32:42,649 --> 01:32:42,659

 

4927
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:44,270

like that

4928
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:44,280
like that
 

4929
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,010
like that
and now I do think it's worth spending

4930
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:46,020
and now I do think it's worth spending
 

4931
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:47,629
and now I do think it's worth spending
eight seconds thinking about our base

4932
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:47,639
eight seconds thinking about our base
 

4933
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:50,450
eight seconds thinking about our base
cases uh here because initially when I

4934
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:50,460
cases uh here because initially when I
 

4935
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,129
cases uh here because initially when I
first saw this I panicked a little bit

4936
01:32:52,129 --> 01:32:52,139
first saw this I panicked a little bit
 

4937
01:32:52,139 --> 01:32:53,390
first saw this I panicked a little bit
because it kind of looks like this

4938
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:53,400
because it kind of looks like this
 

4939
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,530
because it kind of looks like this
should just end up giving you a bunch of

4940
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:54,540
should just end up giving you a bunch of
 

4941
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:55,550
should just end up giving you a bunch of
zeros

4942
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:55,560
zeros
 

4943
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,750
zeros
right because like I'm just adding

4944
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:56,760
right because like I'm just adding
 

4945
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,189
right because like I'm just adding
values of x's to themselves I don't have

4946
01:32:58,189 --> 01:32:58,199
values of x's to themselves I don't have
 

4947
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:00,470
values of x's to themselves I don't have
like a one plus anything anywhere

4948
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:00,480
like a one plus anything anywhere
 

4949
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,669
like a one plus anything anywhere
which is kind of weird if you think

4950
01:33:01,669 --> 01:33:01,679
which is kind of weird if you think
 

4951
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,010
which is kind of weird if you think
about it so all of the reason why the

4952
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:04,020
about it so all of the reason why the
 

4953
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,270
about it so all of the reason why the
positive numbers appear in this problem

4954
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:05,280
positive numbers appear in this problem
 

4955
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,830
positive numbers appear in this problem
is from the base case which is kind of

4956
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:06,840
is from the base case which is kind of
 

4957
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,390
is from the base case which is kind of
cool I think

4958
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:08,400
cool I think
 

4959
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,590
cool I think
um it's like I think one of these things

4960
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:09,600
um it's like I think one of these things
 

4961
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,629
um it's like I think one of these things
where if you anticipated a problem then

4962
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:11,639
where if you anticipated a problem then
 

4963
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:12,890
where if you anticipated a problem then
it's cool and if you didn't anticipate

4964
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:12,900
it's cool and if you didn't anticipate
 

4965
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,149
it's cool and if you didn't anticipate
the problem to begin with you just wrote

4966
01:33:14,149 --> 01:33:14,159
the problem to begin with you just wrote
 

4967
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:15,649
the problem to begin with you just wrote
down this formulas you probably wouldn't

4968
01:33:15,649 --> 01:33:15,659
down this formulas you probably wouldn't
 

4969
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:17,870
down this formulas you probably wouldn't
even think that it's interesting um uh

4970
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:17,880
even think that it's interesting um uh
 

4971
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,250
even think that it's interesting um uh
but but in any event

4972
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:19,260
but but in any event
 

4973
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,070
but but in any event
uh what is our base case so we'll we'll

4974
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:22,080
uh what is our base case so we'll we'll
 

4975
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,410
uh what is our base case so we'll we'll
do the b in sort bot

4976
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:24,420
do the b in sort bot
 

4977
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:25,970
do the b in sort bot
um so first of all

4978
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:25,980
um so first of all
 

4979
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,350
um so first of all
um

4980
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:27,360
um
 

4981
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:31,070
um
what is K of one one remember that's the

4982
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,080
what is K of one one remember that's the
 

4983
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,570
what is K of one one remember that's the
number of mushrooms you can collect by

4984
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:32,580
number of mushrooms you can collect by
 

4985
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:33,830
number of mushrooms you can collect by
starting at the left square and going

4986
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:33,840
starting at the left square and going
 

4987
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,790
starting at the left square and going
nowhere

4988
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:34,800
nowhere
 

4989
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,490
nowhere
and that's zero because the problem says

4990
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:37,500
and that's zero because the problem says
 

4991
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,310
and that's zero because the problem says
there's no mushrooms in the upper left

4992
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:40,320
there's no mushrooms in the upper left
 

4993
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,669
there's no mushrooms in the upper left
what's X of one one well this is the

4994
01:33:43,669 --> 01:33:43,679
what's X of one one well this is the
 

4995
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:45,770
what's X of one one well this is the
number of paths from one one to itself

4996
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:45,780
number of paths from one one to itself
 

4997
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,930
number of paths from one one to itself
that collects zero mushrooms so that's

4998
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:47,940
that collects zero mushrooms so that's
 

4999
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:49,490
that collects zero mushrooms so that's
one

5000
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:49,500
one
 

5001
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,010
one
OK and I think that the rest of the sort

5002
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:52,020
OK and I think that the rest of the sort
 

5003
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:54,410
OK and I think that the rest of the sort
bot table here isn't terribly uh

5004
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:54,420
bot table here isn't terribly uh
 

5005
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,209
bot table here isn't terribly uh
difficult to fill in

5006
01:33:56,209 --> 01:33:56,219
difficult to fill in
 

5007
01:33:56,219 --> 01:33:57,770
difficult to fill in
um so notice that in in a kind of a

5008
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:57,780
um so notice that in in a kind of a
 

5009
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,090
um so notice that in in a kind of a
funny way all of these were Christmas

5010
01:33:59,090 --> 01:33:59,100
funny way all of these were Christmas
 

5011
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,649
funny way all of these were Christmas
steps we're just adding one to itself a

5012
01:34:00,649 --> 01:34:00,659
steps we're just adding one to itself a
 

5013
01:34:00,659 --> 01:34:01,729
steps we're just adding one to itself a
bunch of times

5014
01:34:01,729 --> 01:34:01,739
bunch of times
 

5015
01:34:01,739 --> 01:34:04,550
bunch of times
um but of course the way you do that the

5016
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:04,560
um but of course the way you do that the
 

5017
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,570
um but of course the way you do that the
reason why you get a number that's

5018
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:05,580
reason why you get a number that's
 

5019
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:06,890
reason why you get a number that's
interesting is because of all these if

5020
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:06,900
interesting is because of all these if
 

5021
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,270
interesting is because of all these if
statements and the fact that you can add

5022
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:08,280
statements and the fact that you can add
 

5023
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,430
statements and the fact that you can add
two different pluses coming from two

5024
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:10,440
two different pluses coming from two
 

5025
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:11,689
two different pluses coming from two
different sources

5026
01:34:11,689 --> 01:34:11,699
different sources
 

5027
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:14,030
different sources
okay so I actually do encourage you guys

5028
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:14,040
okay so I actually do encourage you guys
 

5029
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,070
okay so I actually do encourage you guys
to look at the code in the the problem

5030
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:16,080
to look at the code in the the problem
 

5031
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,570
to look at the code in the the problem
solution because I think it's a nice

5032
01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:17,580
solution because I think it's a nice
 

5033
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:19,790
solution because I think it's a nice
example of taking this recursive formula

5034
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:19,800
example of taking this recursive formula
 

5035
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,169
example of taking this recursive formula
and then unrolling it into like

5036
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:21,179
and then unrolling it into like
 

5037
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:23,330
and then unrolling it into like
iterating over a table and that's a

5038
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:23,340
iterating over a table and that's a
 

5039
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:24,830
iterating over a table and that's a
useful skill that I intended to do today

5040
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:24,840
useful skill that I intended to do today
 

5041
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,810
useful skill that I intended to do today
and then didn't actually do uh very

5042
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:26,820
and then didn't actually do uh very
 

5043
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:27,950
and then didn't actually do uh very
carefully

5044
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:27,960
carefully
 

5045
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,270
carefully
um but with that as usual we've gone

5046
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:29,280
um but with that as usual we've gone
 

5047
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,770
um but with that as usual we've gone
over time here so we'll call it for the

5048
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:30,780
over time here so we'll call it for the
 

5049
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:32,990
over time here so we'll call it for the
day uh and I will see you guys

5050
