uh they're excellent people and so
uh they will be working on uh teaching

22
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
uh they will be working on uh teaching
 

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,709
uh they will be working on uh teaching
this class

24
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
this class
 

25
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,549
this class
with me i will be teaching the first

26
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
with me i will be teaching the first
 

27
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,310
with me i will be teaching the first
lecture and we'll have

28
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
lecture and we'll have
 

29
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,869
lecture and we'll have
uh each of them teach one of the next

30
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
uh each of them teach one of the next
 

31
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,470
uh each of them teach one of the next
two lectures

32
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
two lectures
 

33
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,750
two lectures
and then we'll go from there yeah so uh

34
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
and then we'll go from there yeah so uh
 

35
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,189
and then we'll go from there yeah so uh
that's this is intro to algorithms

36
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
that's this is intro to algorithms
 

37
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,709
that's this is intro to algorithms
okay so we're going to start talking

38
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
okay so we're going to start talking
 

39
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,029
okay so we're going to start talking
about this uh course content now what is

40
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
about this uh course content now what is
 

41
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,750
about this uh course content now what is
this course about

42
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
this course about
 

43
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,069
this course about
it's about algorithms right introduction

44
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
it's about algorithms right introduction
 

45
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,430
it's about algorithms right introduction
algorithms really what the course is

46
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
algorithms really what the course is
 

47
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,229
algorithms really what the course is
about is

48
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
about is
 

49
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,950
about is
teaching you to solve computational

50
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
teaching you to solve computational
 

51
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,149
teaching you to solve computational
problems

52
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
problems
 

53
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,390
problems
but it's more than that it's not just

54
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
but it's more than that it's not just
 

55
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,670
but it's more than that it's not just
about teaching you to solve

56
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
about teaching you to solve
 

57
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,870
about teaching you to solve
computational problems so solve

58
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
computational problems so solve
 

59
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,630
computational problems so solve
goal

60
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640

 

61
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,670

one solve

62
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
one solve
 

63
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,590
one solve
computational

64
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600

 

65
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,950

problems but it's more than that

66
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
problems but it's more than that
 

67
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,390
problems but it's more than that
it's also about communicating

68
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
it's also about communicating
 

69
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,270
it's also about communicating
those solutions to others and being able

70
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
those solutions to others and being able
 

71
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,590
those solutions to others and being able
to communicate that your

72
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
to communicate that your
 

73
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,990
to communicate that your
way of solving the problem is correct

74
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
way of solving the problem is correct
 

75
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,350
way of solving the problem is correct
and efficient

76
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
and efficient
 

77
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,190
and efficient
okay so it's about

78
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200

 

79
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,630

two more things uh

80
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
two more things uh
 

81
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,270
two more things uh
prove correctness

82
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280

 

83
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,950

argue efficiency

84
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960

 

85
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,709

and in general it's about

86
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:03,719
and in general it's about
 

87
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,229
and in general it's about
communication communication

88
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
communication communication
 

89
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,790
communication communication
i can't spell by the way uh

90
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
i can't spell by the way uh
 

91
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,790
i can't spell by the way uh
communication of these ideas

92
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
communication of these ideas
 

93
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,390
communication of these ideas
and you'll find that over the course of

94
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
and you'll find that over the course of
 

95
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,309
and you'll find that over the course of
this class you'll be doing a lot more

96
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
this class you'll be doing a lot more
 

97
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,270
this class you'll be doing a lot more
writing

98
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
writing
 

99
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,710
writing
than you do in a lot of your other

100
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
than you do in a lot of your other
 

101
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,790
than you do in a lot of your other
courses it really should maybe be a

102
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
courses it really should maybe be a
 

103
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,510
courses it really should maybe be a
ci kind of class because you'll be doing

104
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
ci kind of class because you'll be doing
 

105
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,030
ci kind of class because you'll be doing
a lot more writing than you will be

106
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
a lot more writing than you will be
 

107
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,510
a lot more writing than you will be
coding

108
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
coding
 

109
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,390
coding
for sure so it's really imp of course

110
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
for sure so it's really imp of course
 

111
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,470
for sure so it's really imp of course
solving the the computational problem is

112
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
solving the the computational problem is
 

113
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,270
solving the the computational problem is
important

114
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
important
 

115
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,790
important
but really the thing that you're getting

116
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
but really the thing that you're getting
 

117
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,390
but really the thing that you're getting
out of this class and other theory

118
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
out of this class and other theory
 

119
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,030
out of this class and other theory
classes

120
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
classes
 

121
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,070
classes
that you're not getting in other

122
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
that you're not getting in other
 

123
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,430
that you're not getting in other
classes in this department is that we

124
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
classes in this department is that we
 

125
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,030
classes in this department is that we
really concentrate on being able to

126
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
really concentrate on being able to
 

127
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,390
really concentrate on being able to
prove that the things you're doing are

128
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
prove that the things you're doing are
 

129
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,350
prove that the things you're doing are
correct

130
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
correct
 

131
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,670
correct
and better than other things and being

132
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
and better than other things and being
 

133
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,270
and better than other things and being
able to communicate those ideas to

134
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
able to communicate those ideas to
 

135
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,150
able to communicate those ideas to
others

136
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
others
 

137
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,949
others
and not just to a computer right to

138
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
and not just to a computer right to
 

139
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,470
and not just to a computer right to
other people convince them that it's

140
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
other people convince them that it's
 

141
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,430
other people convince them that it's
correct

142
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
correct
 

143
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,110
correct
okay so that's what this class is about

144
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
okay so that's what this class is about
 

145
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,270
okay so that's what this class is about
so what do we what do i mean when i say

146
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
so what do we what do i mean when i say
 

147
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,470
so what do we what do i mean when i say
solve a

148
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
solve a
 

149
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,990
solve a
computational problem what is a problem

150
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
computational problem what is a problem
 

151
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,030
computational problem what is a problem
what is an algorithm right i know

152
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
what is an algorithm right i know
 

153
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,550
what is an algorithm right i know
people make fun of me because i start

154
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
people make fun of me because i start
 

155
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,149
people make fun of me because i start
with this question but

156
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
with this question but
 

157
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,910
with this question but
i mean anyone want to answer that

158
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
i mean anyone want to answer that
 

159
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,509
i mean anyone want to answer that
question

160
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519

 

161
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,390

no what's a problem computationally

162
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
no what's a problem computationally
 

163
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,270
no what's a problem computationally
no okay so it's not such a stupid

164
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
no okay so it's not such a stupid
 

165
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,589
no okay so it's not such a stupid
question yeah

166
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
question yeah
 

167
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,149
question yeah
something you want to compute okay yes

168
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
something you want to compute okay yes
 

169
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,430
something you want to compute okay yes
that's that's true

170
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
that's that's true
 

171
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,350
that's that's true
right but kind of a little bit more

172
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
right but kind of a little bit more
 

173
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,589
right but kind of a little bit more
abstractly what i'm going to think of

174
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
abstractly what i'm going to think of
 

175
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,949
abstractly what i'm going to think of
a computational problem being

176

a computational problem being
 

177
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,110
a computational problem being
and this is where uh kind of your

178
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
and this is where uh kind of your
 

179
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,869
and this is where uh kind of your
prerequisite and discrete mathematics

180
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
prerequisite and discrete mathematics
 

181
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,149
prerequisite and discrete mathematics
should come in

182
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
should come in
 

183
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,589
should come in
right it's a problem is kind of

184
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
right it's a problem is kind of
 

185
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,110
right it's a problem is kind of
you've got a set of inputs inputs

186
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
you've got a set of inputs inputs
 

187
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,390
you've got a set of inputs inputs
okay maybe i have uh one two three

188
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
okay maybe i have uh one two three
 

189
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,910
okay maybe i have uh one two three
four five possible inputs i could have

190
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
four five possible inputs i could have
 

191
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,270
four five possible inputs i could have
to my algorithm

192
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
to my algorithm
 

193
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,949
to my algorithm
okay then i have a space of outputs okay

194
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
okay then i have a space of outputs okay
 

195
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,070
okay then i have a space of outputs okay
outputs

196
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080

 

197
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,630

and maybe i don't know maybe i have more

198
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
and maybe i don't know maybe i have more
 

199
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,309
and maybe i don't know maybe i have more
of them than i do inputs but these are

200
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
of them than i do inputs but these are
 

201
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:10,710
of them than i do inputs but these are
the

202
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
the
 

203
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,630
the
possible outputs to my my problem

204
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
possible outputs to my my problem
 

205
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,830
possible outputs to my my problem
and what a problem is is a binary

206
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
and what a problem is is a binary
 

207
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,349
and what a problem is is a binary
relation between these inputs and

208
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
relation between these inputs and
 

209
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,949
relation between these inputs and
outputs essentially for each

210
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
outputs essentially for each
 

211
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,390
outputs essentially for each
input i specify which of these outputs

212
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
input i specify which of these outputs
 

213
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,670
input i specify which of these outputs
is correct right it doesn't necessarily

214
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
is correct right it doesn't necessarily
 

215
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,110
is correct right it doesn't necessarily
have to be one

216
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
have to be one
 

217
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,230
have to be one
right if i say give me the index

218
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
right if i say give me the index
 

219
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,350
right if i say give me the index
in an array containing the value five

220
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
in an array containing the value five
 

221
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,950
in an array containing the value five
there could be multiple fives in that

222
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
there could be multiple fives in that
 

223
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,189
there could be multiple fives in that
array and so any of those indices would

224
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
array and so any of those indices would
 

225
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,749
array and so any of those indices would
be

226
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
be
 

227
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,189
be
correct so uh maybe this guy maps to

228
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
correct so uh maybe this guy maps to
 

229
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,070
correct so uh maybe this guy maps to
that output and maybe this guy maps to i

230
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
that output and maybe this guy maps to i
 

231
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,070
that output and maybe this guy maps to i
don't know two or three outputs

232
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
don't know two or three outputs
 

233
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,150
don't know two or three outputs
right this input goes to one

234
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
right this input goes to one
 

235
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,790
right this input goes to one
two i don't know there's a there's some

236
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
two i don't know there's a there's some
 

237
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,390
two i don't know there's a there's some
kind of mapping here these edges

238
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
kind of mapping here these edges
 

239
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,469
kind of mapping here these edges
represent a binary relation

240
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
represent a binary relation
 

241
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,029
represent a binary relation
it's kind of a graph a bipartite graph

242
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
it's kind of a graph a bipartite graph
 

243
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:01,990
it's kind of a graph a bipartite graph
between these

244
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
between these
 

245
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,670
between these
inputs and outputs and these are

246
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
inputs and outputs and these are
 

247
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,510
inputs and outputs and these are
specifying which of these outputs are

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
specifying which of these outputs are
 

249
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,590

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
correct for these inputs
 

251
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,670
correct for these inputs
all right that's really the formal

252
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
all right that's really the formal
 

253
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,870
all right that's really the formal
definition of

have a
 

259
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,590
have a
problem and a computational problem

i'm not going to specify the problem to

262
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
i'm not going to specify the problem to
 

263
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,029
i'm not going to specify the problem to
you by saying

264
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
you by saying
 

265
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,390
you by saying
okay for input 1 the correct answer

266
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
okay for input 1 the correct answer
 

267
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,189
okay for input 1 the correct answer
is 0. and for input 2 the correct answer

268
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
is 0. and for input 2 the correct answer
 

269
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,670
is 0. and for input 2 the correct answer
is 3

270
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
is 3
 

271
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,189
is 3
and so on and so forth that would take

272
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
and so on and so forth that would take
 

273
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,749
and so on and so forth that would take
forever right usually what we do

274
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
forever right usually what we do
 

275
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,469
forever right usually what we do
when defining a problem is specify some

276
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
when defining a problem is specify some
 

277
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,590
when defining a problem is specify some
kind of predicate

278
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
kind of predicate
 

279
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,629
kind of predicate
saying that oh we can check

280
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
saying that oh we can check
 

281
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,390
saying that oh we can check
if i give you an input and an output i

282
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
if i give you an input and an output i
 

283
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,670
if i give you an input and an output i
can check whether that

284
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
can check whether that
 

285
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,590
can check whether that
output is correct or not that's usually

286
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
output is correct or not that's usually
 

287
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,710
output is correct or not that's usually
how we define

288
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
how we define
 

289
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,790
how we define
a problem is if i

290
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
a problem is if i
 

291
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,110
a problem is if i
i'm checking for whether this index

292
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
i'm checking for whether this index
 

293
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,629
i'm checking for whether this index
contains a five i can just

294
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
contains a five i can just
 

295
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,629
contains a five i can just
go to that array look at index five and

296
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
go to that array look at index five and
 

297
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,870
go to that array look at index five and
say or that the index you gave me

298
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
say or that the index you gave me
 

299
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,430
say or that the index you gave me
and see if it equals five right so

300
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
and see if it equals five right so
 

301
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,189
and see if it equals five right so
usually we're putting it in terms of

302
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
usually we're putting it in terms of
 

303
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,350
usually we're putting it in terms of
predicates because in general we don't

304
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
predicates because in general we don't
 

305
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,590
predicates because in general we don't
really want to talk about

306
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
really want to talk about
 

307
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,230
really want to talk about
small instances of problems so let's say

308
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
small instances of problems so let's say
 

309
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,590
small instances of problems so let's say
i had the problem

310
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
i had the problem
 

311
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,749
i had the problem
of among the students in this classroom

312
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
of among the students in this classroom
 

313
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,189
of among the students in this classroom
do any pair of you have the same

314
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
do any pair of you have the same
 

315
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,270

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
birthday okay
 

317
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,749
birthday okay
all right well probably if there's more

318
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
all right well probably if there's more
 

319
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,350
all right well probably if there's more
than 365 of you

320
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
than 365 of you
 

321
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,790
than 365 of you
the answer is yes right right that by

322
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
the answer is yes right right that by
 

323
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,629
the answer is yes right right that by
what pigeonhole principle right

324
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
what pigeonhole principle right
 

325
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,710
what pigeonhole principle right
two of you must have the same birthday

326
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
two of you must have the same birthday
 

327
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,909
two of you must have the same birthday
right but

328
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
right but
 

329
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,230
right but
so let's let's generalize it a little

330
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
so let's let's generalize it a little

that you were born and that's a bigger

344
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
that you were born and that's a bigger
 

345
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,189
that you were born and that's a bigger
space of inputs and i wouldn't

346
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
space of inputs and i wouldn't
 

347
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,070
space of inputs and i wouldn't
necessarily

348
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
necessarily
 

349
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,189
necessarily
expect that two of you would be born in

350
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
expect that two of you would be born in
 

351
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,110
expect that two of you would be born in
the same year on the same day in the

352
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
the same year on the same day in the
 

353
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,070
the same year on the same day in the
same hour

354
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
same hour
 

355
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,990
same hour
right that would be a little less likely

356
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
right that would be a little less likely
 

357
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,550
right that would be a little less likely
in fact as long as that space is larger

358
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
in fact as long as that space is larger
 

359
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,909
in fact as long as that space is larger
than something like

360
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
than something like
 

361
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,950
than something like
the square of the number of you

362
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
the square of the number of you
 

363
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,230
the square of the number of you
right then i'm less likely than

364
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
right then i'm less likely than
 

365
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,670
right then i'm less likely than
then than even to uh

366
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
then than even to uh
 

367
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,110
then than even to uh
to have a pair of you that that's a

368
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
to have a pair of you that that's a
 

369
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,990
to have a pair of you that that's a
kind of a birthday problem you may have

370
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
kind of a birthday problem you may have
 

371
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,870
kind of a birthday problem you may have
seen

372
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
seen
 

373
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,909
seen
in uh 0-4-2

374
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
in uh 0-4-2
 

375
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,950
in uh 0-4-2
potentially right but in general i don't

376
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
potentially right but in general i don't
 

377
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,469
potentially right but in general i don't
i don't i'm not going to mess with

378
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
i don't i'm not going to mess with
 

379
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,990
i don't i'm not going to mess with
probability so much here

380
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
probability so much here
 

381
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,629
probability so much here
i want a deterministic algorithm right a

382
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
i want a deterministic algorithm right a
 

383
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,990
i want a deterministic algorithm right a
way of checking

384
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
way of checking
 

385
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,230
way of checking
whether two of you have the same birth

386
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
whether two of you have the same birth
 

387
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,670
whether two of you have the same birth
time let's say

388
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
time let's say
 

389
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,870
time let's say
okay so uh in general in this class

390
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
okay so uh in general in this class
 

391
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,950
okay so uh in general in this class
we're not going to concentrate on

392
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
we're not going to concentrate on
 

393
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,230
we're not going to concentrate on
input such as is there

394
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
input such as is there
 

395
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,390
input such as is there
a pair of you in this class that have

396
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
a pair of you in this class that have
 

397
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,350
a pair of you in this class that have
the same birthday

398
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
the same birthday
 

399
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,830
the same birthday
that's kind of boring right uh i i could

400
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
that's kind of boring right uh i i could
 

401
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,790
that's kind of boring right uh i i could
just say

402
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
just say
 

403
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,909
just say
well uh i i could do a lot of different

404
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
well uh i i could do a lot of different
 

405
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,710
well uh i i could do a lot of different
things but

406
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
things but
 

407
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,869
things but
what we we do in this class this is

408
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
what we we do in this class this is
 

409
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,550
what we we do in this class this is
first a fixed

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
any classroom right to go to your
 

417
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,589
any classroom right to go to your
recitation i want an algorithm that will

apply to your recitation
an algorithm that not only applies to

422
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
an algorithm that not only applies to
 

423
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,790
an algorithm that not only applies to
this classroom but also the machine

424
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
this classroom but also the machine
 

425
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,309
this classroom but also the machine

426
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
learning class before you
 

427
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,550
learning class before you
right i want an algorithm that can

428
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
right i want an algorithm that can
 

429
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,550
right i want an algorithm that can
change

430
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
change
 

431
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,710
change
its it can accept an arbitrarily sized

432
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
its it can accept an arbitrarily sized
 

433
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,430
its it can accept an arbitrarily sized
input

434
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
input
 

435
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,909
input
right here we have a class of maybe 300

436
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
right here we have a class of maybe 300
 

437
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,589
right here we have a class of maybe 300
400 students

438
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
400 students
 

439
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,270
400 students
right but i want my algorithm to work

440
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
right but i want my algorithm to work
 

441
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,029
right but i want my algorithm to work
for a billion students

442
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
for a billion students
 

443
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,950
for a billion students
right like maybe i'm trying to check if

444
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
right like maybe i'm trying to check if
 

445
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,630
right like maybe i'm trying to check if
there's a match of something

446
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
there's a match of something
 

447
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,469
there's a match of something
in the facebook database or something

448
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
in the facebook database or something
 

449
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,829
in the facebook database or something
like that right

450
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
like that right
 

451
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,269
like that right
okay so in general uh

452
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
okay so in general uh
 

453
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,790
okay so in general uh
we are looking for general

454
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800

 

455
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,910

problems

456
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920

 

457
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,970

that have arbitrarily

458
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:50,980
that have arbitrarily
 

459
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,870
that have arbitrarily
[Music]

460
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
[Music]
 

461
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,389
[Music]
sized inputs right so

462
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
sized inputs right so
 

463
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,430
sized inputs right so
these these inputs could grow very large

464
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
these these inputs could grow very large
 

465
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,190
these these inputs could grow very large
but we want a kind of a fixed

466
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
but we want a kind of a fixed
 

467
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,389
but we want a kind of a fixed
size algorithm to solve those problems

468
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
size algorithm to solve those problems
 

469
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:19,190
size algorithm to solve those problems
okay so what is an algorithm then

470
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200

 

471
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,470

i really can't spell i told you okay

472
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
i really can't spell i told you okay
 

473
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,509
i really can't spell i told you okay
i didn't lie to you um so an

474
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
i didn't lie to you um so an
 

475
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,949
i didn't lie to you um so an
algorithm is a little different than a

476
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
algorithm is a little different than a
 

477
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,030
algorithm is a little different than a
problem of problem

478
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
problem of problem
 

479
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,150
problem of problem
specification i can state to you what

480
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
specification i can state to you what
 

481
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,030
specification i can state to you what
this graph

482
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
this graph
 

483
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,269
this graph
or i can tell you what this graph looks

484
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
or i can tell you what this graph looks
 

485
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,790
or i can tell you what this graph looks
like an algorithm is really

486
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
like an algorithm is really
 

487
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,310
like an algorithm is really
i don't know what the outputs are i

488
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
i don't know what the outputs are i
 

489
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,150
i don't know what the outputs are i
don't know what these edges are

490
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
don't know what these edges are
 

491
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,389
don't know what these edges are
but i want to i want a fixed size kind

492
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
but i want to i want a fixed size kind
 

493
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,269
but i want to i want a fixed size kind
of

494
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
of
 

495
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,750
of
machine or procedure that if i give it

496
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
machine or procedure that if i give it
 

497
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,350
machine or procedure that if i give it
an input

498
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
an input
 

499
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,310
an input
it will generate an output and if it

500
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
it will generate an output and if it
 

501
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,829
it will generate an output and if it
generates an output it better be one of

502
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
generates an output it better be one of
 

503
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,670
generates an output it better be one of
these correct outputs

504
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
these correct outputs
 

505
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,269
these correct outputs
right so if i have an algorithm that

506
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
right so if i have an algorithm that
 

507
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,630
right so if i have an algorithm that
takes in this input

508
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
takes in this input
 

509
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,110
takes in this input
i really want it to output this output

510
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
i really want it to output this output
 

511
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,030
i really want it to output this output
or else it's not a correct algorithm

512
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
or else it's not a correct algorithm
 

513
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,350
or else it's not a correct algorithm
similarly if for this one it could

514
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
similarly if for this one it could
 

515
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,509
similarly if for this one it could
output any of these three

516
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
output any of these three
 

517
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,030
output any of these three
outputs but if it outputs this guy

518
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
outputs but if it outputs this guy
 

519
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,190
outputs but if it outputs this guy
for this input that would not be a

520
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
for this input that would not be a
 

521
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,630
for this input that would not be a
correct algorithm right

522
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
correct algorithm right
 

523
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,750
correct algorithm right
and so generally what we want is a an

524
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
and so generally what we want is a an
 

525
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,350
and so generally what we want is a an
algorithm is a function it takes

526
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
algorithm is a function it takes
 

527
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,230
algorithm is a function it takes
inputs to outputs right an algorithm is

528
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
inputs to outputs right an algorithm is
 

529
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,470
inputs to outputs right an algorithm is
some kind of function

530
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
some kind of function
 

531
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,030
some kind of function
right that takes these inputs maps it to

532
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
right that takes these inputs maps it to
 

533
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,550
right that takes these inputs maps it to
a single output

534
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
a single output
 

535
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,470
a single output
and that output better be correct based

536
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
and that output better be correct based
 

537
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,389
and that output better be correct based
on our problem okay

538
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
on our problem okay
 

539
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,509
on our problem okay
so that's what our algorithm is uh

540
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
so that's what our algorithm is uh
 

541
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,590
so that's what our algorithm is uh
it solves the problem if it returns a

542
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
it solves the problem if it returns a
 

543
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,110
it solves the problem if it returns a
correct output for every

544
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
correct output for every
 

545
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,389
correct output for every
uh problem input that is in our domain

546
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
uh problem input that is in our domain
 

547
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,470
uh problem input that is in our domain
okay and the example for uh

548
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
okay and the example for uh
 

549
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,630
okay and the example for uh
does anyone have a possible algorithm

550
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
does anyone have a possible algorithm
 

551
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,790
does anyone have a possible algorithm
for checking whether any two of you have

552
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
for checking whether any two of you have
 

553
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,310
for checking whether any two of you have
the same birth time

554
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
the same birth time
 

555
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,430

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,389

i'm going to let someone else have a try

558
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
i'm going to let someone else have a try
 

559
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,030
i'm going to let someone else have a try
sure

560
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
sure
 

561
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,910

just ask everyone one by one

562
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920

 

563
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,790

ah great so uh what your colleague has

564
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
ah great so uh what your colleague has
 

565
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,470

right i'm going to put in in some kind

588
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
right i'm going to put in in some kind
 

589
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,030
right i'm going to put in in some kind
of record okay

590
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
of record okay
 

591
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,990
of record okay
and then as i keep interviewing you i'm

going to
 

595
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,230
going to
find out your birthday i'm going to

596
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
find out your birthday i'm going to
 

597
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,910
find out your birthday i'm going to
check the record i'm going to look

598
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
check the record i'm going to look
 

599
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,509
check the record i'm going to look
through all the birthdays in the record

600
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
through all the birthdays in the record
 

601
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,790
through all the birthdays in the record
if i find a match right then i return

602
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
if i find a match right then i return
 

603
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,670
if i find a match right then i return
yay i found a pair and i can stop

604
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
yay i found a pair and i can stop
 

605
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,110
yay i found a pair and i can stop
otherwise if i get through the record

606
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
otherwise if i get through the record
 

607
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,710
otherwise if i get through the record
list i

608
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
list i
 

609
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,790
list i
don't and i don't find a match i just

610
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
don't and i don't find a match i just
 

611
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,389
don't and i don't find a match i just
stick you at the end of the record

612
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
stick you at the end of the record
 

613
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,710
stick you at the end of the record
right i add you to the record and then i

614
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
right i add you to the record and then i
 

615
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,310
right i add you to the record and then i
move on to the next person i keep doing

616
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
move on to the next person i keep doing
 

617
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,430
move on to the next person i keep doing
this okay so that's

618
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
this okay so that's
 

619
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,030
this okay so that's
that's a proposed algorithm for this

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
but if you said this algorithm to any of
 

685
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,910
but if you said this algorithm to any of
your

686
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
your
 

687
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,389
your
your friends in this class right they

688
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
your friends in this class right they
 

689
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,110
your friends in this class right they
would at least

690
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
would at least
 

691
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,870
would at least
understand what it is that you're doing

692
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
understand what it is that you're doing
 

693
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,430
understand what it is that you're doing
yeah does an algorithm have to be a pure

694
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
yeah does an algorithm have to be a pure
 

695
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,990
yeah does an algorithm have to be a pure
function

696
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
function
 

697
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,590
function
mathematical pure function in the does a

698
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
mathematical pure function in the does a
 

699
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,269
mathematical pure function in the does a
an algorithm have to be a pure function

700
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
an algorithm have to be a pure function
 

701
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,790
an algorithm have to be a pure function
in the mathematical sense

702
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
in the mathematical sense
 

703
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,430
in the mathematical sense
uh as in it needs to map to a single

704
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
uh as in it needs to map to a single
 

705
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,829
uh as in it needs to map to a single
output

706
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839

 

707
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,389

so we're talking about kind of a

708
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
so we're talking about kind of a
 

709
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,230
so we're talking about kind of a
functional programming definition

710
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
functional programming definition
 

711
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,990
functional programming definition
of uh of a of a of a function right this

712
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
of uh of a of a of a function right this
 

713
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,230
of uh of a of a of a function right this
is

714
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
is
 

715
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,910
is
um i am talking about the mathematical

716
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
um i am talking about the mathematical
 

717
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,189
um i am talking about the mathematical
i have a binary relation and this thing

718
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
i have a binary relation and this thing
 

719
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,470
i have a binary relation and this thing
has an output for every input and

720
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
has an output for every input and
 

721
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,629
has an output for every input and
there is exactly one output to every

722
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
there is exactly one output to every
 

723
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,509
there is exactly one output to every
input that's

724
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
input that's
 

725
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,269
input that's
that's the mathematical definition of

726
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
that's the mathematical definition of
 

727
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,550
that's the mathematical definition of
function that i'm using

728
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
function that i'm using
 

729
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,150
function that i'm using
for when i'm defining an algorithm yeah

730
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
for when i'm defining an algorithm yeah
 

731
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,230
for when i'm defining an algorithm yeah
so basically is an algorithm like uh

732
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
so basically is an algorithm like uh
 

733
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,870
so basically is an algorithm like uh
like a plan yeah an algorithm is a

734
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
like a plan yeah an algorithm is a
 

735
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,069
like a plan yeah an algorithm is a
procedure

736
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
procedure
 

737
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,470
procedure
that somehow i can do whatever i want

738
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
that somehow i can do whatever i want
 

739
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,150
that somehow i can do whatever i want
but i have to take one of these inputs

740
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
but i have to take one of these inputs
 

741
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,670
but i have to take one of these inputs
and i have to produce an output and at

742
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
and i have to produce an output and at
 

743
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,069
and i have to produce an output and at
the end it better be correct

744
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
the end it better be correct
 

745
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,590
the end it better be correct
right so it's just a procedure you can

746
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
right so it's just a procedure you can
 

747
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,189
right so it's just a procedure you can
think of it as like

748
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
think of it as like
 

749
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,509
think of it as like
a recipe you can think of it it's just

750
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
a recipe you can think of it it's just
 

751
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,670
a recipe you can think of it it's just
some kind of procedure right it's a

752
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
some kind of procedure right it's a
 

753
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,430
some kind of procedure right it's a
a sequence of things that you should do

754
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
a sequence of things that you should do
 

755
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,189
a sequence of things that you should do
and then at the end you will return an

756
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
and then at the end you will return an
 

757
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,230
and then at the end you will return an
output

758
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
output
 

759
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,829
output
okay so here's a possible algorithm for

760
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
okay so here's a possible algorithm for
 

761
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,150
okay so here's a possible algorithm for
solving this birthday problem

762
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
solving this birthday problem
 

763
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,590
solving this birthday problem
okay now i've given you

764
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
okay now i've given you
 

765
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,110
okay now i've given you
what i argue to you or i'm asserting to

766
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
what i argue to you or i'm asserting to
 

767
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,670
what i argue to you or i'm asserting to
you

768
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
you
 

769
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,150
you
is a solution to this birthday problem

770
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
is a solution to this birthday problem
 

771
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,590
is a solution to this birthday problem
and maybe you guys

772
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
and maybe you guys
 

773
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,269
and maybe you guys
agree with me and maybe some of you

774
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
agree with me and maybe some of you
 

775
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,790
agree with me and maybe some of you
don't right

776
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
don't right
 

777
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,749
don't right
so how do i convince you that this is

778
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
so how do i convince you that this is
 

779
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,790
so how do i convince you that this is
correct

780
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
correct
 

781
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,189
correct
right well if i had

782
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
right well if i had
 

783
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,189
right well if i had
you know if i was just running this

784
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
you know if i was just running this
 

785
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,949
you know if i was just running this
algorithm

786
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
algorithm
 

787
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,110
algorithm
on say the four students in the front

788
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
on say the four students in the front
 

789
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,310
on say the four students in the front
row here

790
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
row here
 

791
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,550
row here
right i could argue it pretty well to

792
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
right i could argue it pretty well to
 

793
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,350
right i could argue it pretty well to
you i could

794
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
you i could
 

795
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,110
you i could
go through every you know

796
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
go through every you know
 

797
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,749
go through every you know
i could assign these for people

798
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
i could assign these for people
 

799
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,069
i could assign these for people
birthdays in various combinations of

800
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
birthdays in various combinations of
 

801
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,870
birthdays in various combinations of
either their none of them have the same

802
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
either their none of them have the same
 

803
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,829
either their none of them have the same
birthday

804
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
birthday
 

805
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,430
birthday
some two of them have the same birthday

806
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
some two of them have the same birthday
 

807
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,350
some two of them have the same birthday
i could try all possibilities and

808
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
i could try all possibilities and
 

809
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,949
i could try all possibilities and
i could go through lots of different

810
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
i could go through lots of different
 

811
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,629
i could go through lots of different
possibilities i had to check that this

812
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639
possibilities i had to check that this
 

813
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,069
possibilities i had to check that this
algorithm returns the right

814
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
algorithm returns the right
 

815
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,949
algorithm returns the right
answer in all such cases right but when

816
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
answer in all such cases right but when
 

817
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,670
answer in all such cases right but when
i have

818
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
i have
 

819
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,150
i have
i don't know 300 of you that's going to

820
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
i don't know 300 of you that's going to
 

821
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,590
i don't know 300 of you that's going to
be a little bit more difficult to argue

822
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
be a little bit more difficult to argue
 

823
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,829
be a little bit more difficult to argue
and so if i want to argue something

824
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
and so if i want to argue something
 

825
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,590
and so if i want to argue something
is correct in mathematics i want to

826
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
is correct in mathematics i want to
 

827
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,949
is correct in mathematics i want to
prove something to you

828
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
prove something to you
 

829
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,590
prove something to you
for some large value what kind of

830
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
for some large value what kind of
 

831
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,509
for some large value what kind of
technique do i use to prove such things

832
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
technique do i use to prove such things
 

833
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,030
technique do i use to prove such things
yeah induction right and in general

834
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
yeah induction right and in general
 

835
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,829
yeah induction right and in general
what what we do in this class what we do

836
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
what what we do in this class what we do
 

837
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,629
what what we do in this class what we do
is as a computer scientist is we write a

838
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
is as a computer scientist is we write a
 

839
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,350
is as a computer scientist is we write a
constant sized piece of code right

840
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
constant sized piece of code right
 

841
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,870
constant sized piece of code right
that can take on any arbitrarily large

842
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
that can take on any arbitrarily large
 

843
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,069
that can take on any arbitrarily large
size input

844
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
size input
 

845
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,310
size input
right if it's if the input can be

right if it's if the input can be
 

847
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,910
right if it's if the input can be
arbitrarily large but our

848
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
arbitrarily large but our
 

849
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,590
arbitrarily large but our
code is small then that code needs to

850
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
code is small then that code needs to
 

851
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,189
code is small then that code needs to

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,430
repeat some of these lines of code in
order to just read that

856
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
order to just read that
 

857
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,870
order to just read that
output right and so that's another way

858
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
output right and so that's another way
 

859
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,350
output right and so that's another way
you can

860
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
you can
 

861
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,790
you can
arrive at this conclusion that we're

862
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
arrive at this conclusion that we're
 

863
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,949
arrive at this conclusion that we're
going to probably need to use recursion

864
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
going to probably need to use recursion
 

865
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,230
going to probably need to use recursion
induction

866
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
induction
 

867
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,069
induction
and that's part of the reason why we ask

868
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
and that's part of the reason why we ask
 

869
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,270
and that's part of the reason why we ask
you to take

870
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
you to take
 

871
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,710
you to take
a course on proofs and and inductive

872
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
a course on proofs and and inductive
 

873
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,949
a course on proofs and and inductive
reasoning and discrete mathematics

874
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
reasoning and discrete mathematics
 

875
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,069
reasoning and discrete mathematics
before this class

876
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
before this class
 

877
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,069
before this class
okay so how do we prove that this thing

878
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
okay so how do we prove that this thing
 

879
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:29,350
okay so how do we prove that this thing
is correct

880
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360

 

881
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,870

we got to use induction so how can we

882
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
we got to use induction so how can we
 

883
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,470
we got to use induction so how can we
set up this induction

884
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480

 

885
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,150

what do i need for an inductive proof

886
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160

 

887
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,870

sure base case we need a base case

888
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
sure base case we need a base case
 

889
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,070
sure base case we need a base case
uh we need some kind of uh

890
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
uh we need some kind of uh
 

891
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,750
uh we need some kind of uh
a predicate yeah but we need some kind

892
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
a predicate yeah but we need some kind
 

893
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,750
a predicate yeah but we need some kind
of statement of a hypothesis of

894
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
of statement of a hypothesis of
 

895
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,750
of statement of a hypothesis of
something that should be maintained

896
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
something that should be maintained
 

897
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,350
something that should be maintained
right and then we need to

898
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
right and then we need to
 

899
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,110
right and then we need to
have an inductive step which basically

900
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
have an inductive step which basically
 

901
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,830
have an inductive step which basically
says i take a small value of this thing

902
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
says i take a small value of this thing
 

903
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,549
says i take a small value of this thing
i use the inductive hypothesis and i

904
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
i use the inductive hypothesis and i
 

905
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,430
i use the inductive hypothesis and i
argue it for

906
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
argue it for
 

907
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,029
argue it for
a larger value of my well-ordered set

908
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
a larger value of my well-ordered set
 

909
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,150
a larger value of my well-ordered set
that i'm inducting over

910
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
that i'm inducting over
 

911
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,350
that i'm inducting over
right okay so in uh

912
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
right okay so in uh
 

913
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,950
right okay so in uh
for this algorithm if we're going to try

914
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
for this algorithm if we're going to try
 

915
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,710
for this algorithm if we're going to try
to prove correctness

916
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
to prove correctness
 

917
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,270
to prove correctness
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

918
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
what i'm going to do is i'm going to
 

919
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,710
what i'm going to do is i'm going to
what do i want to prove for this thing

920
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
what do i want to prove for this thing
 

921
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,150
what do i want to prove for this thing
that at the end of

922
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
that at the end of
 

923
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,190
that at the end of
interviewing all of you that my

924
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
interviewing all of you that my
 

925
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,549
interviewing all of you that my
algorithm has either already

926
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
algorithm has either already
 

927
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,710
algorithm has either already
it has returned with a pair that match

928
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
it has returned with a pair that match
 

929
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,070
it has returned with a pair that match
or if we're in a case where there wasn't

930
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
or if we're in a case where there wasn't
 

931
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,789
or if we're in a case where there wasn't
a mat

932
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
a mat
 

933
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,549
a mat
it wasn't a pair somewhere in my set

934
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
it wasn't a pair somewhere in my set
 

935
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,310
it wasn't a pair somewhere in my set
that it returned none right

936
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
that it returned none right
 

937
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,510
that it returned none right
that would be correct right so how can i

938
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
that would be correct right so how can i
 

939
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,350
that would be correct right so how can i
generalize that concept

940
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
generalize that concept
 

941
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,310
generalize that concept
to make it something i can induct on

942
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
to make it something i can induct on
 

943
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,950
to make it something i can induct on
right

944
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
right
 

945
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,830
right
what i'm going to do is i'm going to say

946
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
what i'm going to do is i'm going to say
 

947
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,350
what i'm going to do is i'm going to say
let's say after i've interviewed the

948
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
let's say after i've interviewed the
 

949
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,630
let's say after i've interviewed the
first

950
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
first
 

951
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,270
first
k students right

952
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
k students right
 

953
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,590
k students right
if there was a match in those first k

954
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
if there was a match in those first k
 

955
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,630
if there was a match in those first k
students

956
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
students
 

957
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,150
students
i want to be sure that i ever returned a

958
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
i want to be sure that i ever returned a
 

959
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,029
i want to be sure that i ever returned a
pair right

960
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
pair right
 

961
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,710
pair right
because if after i interview all of you

962
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
because if after i interview all of you
 

963
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,950
because if after i interview all of you
i've maintained that property

964
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
i've maintained that property
 

965
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,789
i've maintained that property
then i'll be sure at the end of the

966
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
then i'll be sure at the end of the
 

967
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,310
then i'll be sure at the end of the
process i will have

968
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
process i will have
 

969
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,549
process i will have
returned a pair if one exists so here's

970
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
returned a pair if one exists so here's
 

971
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:26,230
returned a pair if one exists so here's
going to be my inductive hypothesis

972
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240

 

973
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,310

sis okay if

974
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
sis okay if
 

975
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,350
sis okay if
first k

976
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360

979
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:48,390

contain a match

980
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400

 

981
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,950

algorithm returns a match

982
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960

 

983
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,510

before interviewing

984
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520

 

985
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,870

say student

986
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880

 

987
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,710

k plus 1. okay so that's going to be my

988
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
k plus 1. okay so that's going to be my
 

989
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,390
k plus 1. okay so that's going to be my
inductive hypothesis now if there's

990
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
inductive hypothesis now if there's
 

991
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,430
inductive hypothesis now if there's
n students in this class right

992
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
n students in this class right
 

993
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,990
n students in this class right
and at the end of my thing i'm trying to

994
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
and at the end of my thing i'm trying to
 

995
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,470
and at the end of my thing i'm trying to
interview

996
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
interview
 

997
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,470
interview
student n plus one oh student n plus one

998
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
student n plus one oh student n plus one
 

999
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,830
student n plus one oh student n plus one
is not there

1000
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
is not there
 

1001
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,430
is not there
if i have maintained this

1002
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
if i have maintained this
 

1003
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,630
if i have maintained this
then if i replace k with n then i will

1004
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
then if i replace k with n then i will
 

1005
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,310
then if i replace k with n then i will
have returned a match

1006
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
have returned a match
 

1007
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,470
have returned a match
before interviewing the last student or

1008
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
before interviewing the last student or
 

1009
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,750
before interviewing the last student or
the

1010
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
the
 

1011
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,070
the
when i have no more students left and

1012
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
when i have no more students left and
 

1013
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,149
when i have no more students left and
then this algorithm returns none

1014
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
then this algorithm returns none
 

1015
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,990
then this algorithm returns none
as it should right okay

1016
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
as it should right okay
 

1017
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,190
as it should right okay
so this inductive hypothesis sets up a

1018
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
so this inductive hypothesis sets up a
 

1019
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,909
so this inductive hypothesis sets up a
nice

1020
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
nice
 

1021
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,549
nice
variable to induct on right this k i can

1022
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
variable to induct on right this k i can
 

1023
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,149
variable to induct on right this k i can
have increasing

1024
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
have increasing
 

1025
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,950
have increasing
up to n starting at some base case so

1026
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
up to n starting at some base case so
 

1027
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,630
up to n starting at some base case so
what's my base case here

1028
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640

 

1029
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,710

my base case is the easiest thing i can

1030
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
my base case is the easiest thing i can
 

1031
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,270
my base case is the easiest thing i can
do

1032
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
do
 

1033
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,950
do
sure two that's an easy thing i could do

1034
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
sure two that's an easy thing i could do
 

1035
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,470
sure two that's an easy thing i could do
i could check those possibilities but

1036
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
i could check those possibilities but
 

1037
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,590
i could check those possibilities but
there's an even easier

1038
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
there's an even easier
 

1039
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,230
there's an even easier
base case yeah there's an even easier

1040
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
base case yeah there's an even easier
 

1041
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,669
base case yeah there's an even easier
base case than one

1042
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
base case than one
 

1043
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,270
base case than one
zero right after interviewing

1044
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
zero right after interviewing
 

1045
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,950
zero right after interviewing
zero students i haven't done any work

1046
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
zero students i haven't done any work
 

1047
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,870
zero students i haven't done any work
right certainly the first

1048
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
right certainly the first
 

1049
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,350
right certainly the first
zero can't have a match right

1050
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
zero can't have a match right
 

1051
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,630
zero can't have a match right
and so this predicate this

1052
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
and so this predicate this
 

1053
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,549
and so this predicate this
inductive hypothesis is true

1054
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
inductive hypothesis is true
 

1055
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,190
inductive hypothesis is true
just because this uh initial predicate

1056
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
just because this uh initial predicate
 

1057
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,070
just because this uh initial predicate
is false

1058
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
is false
 

1059
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,510
is false
right so i can say you know base case

1060
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
right so i can say you know base case
 

1061
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,710
right so i can say you know base case
zero check definitely this predicate

1062
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
zero check definitely this predicate
 

1063
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,549
zero check definitely this predicate
holds for that

1064
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
holds for that
 

1065
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,270
holds for that
okay now we get to go for the

1066
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
okay now we get to go for the
 

1067
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,830
okay now we get to go for the
uh the meat of this thing right

1068
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840

 

1069
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,029

assume the inductive hypothesis

1070
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
assume the inductive hypothesis
 

1071
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,190
assume the inductive hypothesis
true for k equals say

1072
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
true for k equals say
 

1073
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,270
true for k equals say
some k prime okay and we're considering

1074
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,280
some k prime okay and we're considering
 

1075
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,110
some k prime okay and we're considering
k prime plus one right

1076
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120

 

1077
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,909

then we have two cases one of the nice

1078
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
then we have two cases one of the nice
 

1079
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,909
then we have two cases one of the nice
things about induction is that it

1080
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
things about induction is that it
 

1081
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,590
things about induction is that it
isolates our our problem to not consider

1082
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
isolates our our problem to not consider
 

1083
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,830
isolates our our problem to not consider
everything all at once but break it down

1084
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
everything all at once but break it down
 

1085
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,870
everything all at once but break it down
into

1086
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
into
 

1087
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,430
into
a smaller interface so i can do less

1088
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,440
a smaller interface so i can do less
 

1089
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,710
a smaller interface so i can do less
work at each step

1090
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
work at each step
 

1091
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,870
work at each step
right so there are two cases

1092
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880

 

1093
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,149

either the first k

1094
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
either the first k
 

1095
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,230
either the first k
already had a match right

1096
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,240
already had a match right
 

1097
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,669
already had a match right
in which case by our inductive

1098
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:45,679
in which case by our inductive
 

1099
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,350
in which case by our inductive
hypothesis we've already returned the

1100
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
hypothesis we've already returned the
 

1101
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,149
hypothesis we've already returned the
correct answer

1102
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
correct answer
 

1103
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,310
correct answer
right the other case is

1104
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
right the other case is
 

1105
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,029
right the other case is
the it doesn't have a match and we

1106
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
the it doesn't have a match and we
 

1107
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,830
the it doesn't have a match and we
interview

1108
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
interview
 

1109
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,270
interview
the k plus one student the k prime plus

1110
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
the k plus one student the k prime plus
 

1111
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,590
the k plus one student the k prime plus
one

1112
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
one
 

1113
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,789
one
student if there is

1114
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
student if there is
 

1115
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,669
student if there is
a match in the first k prime plus one

1116
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
a match in the first k prime plus one
 

1117
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,710
a match in the first k prime plus one
students

1118
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
students
 

1119
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,909
students
then it will include k plus k prime plus

1120
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
then it will include k plus k prime plus
 

1121
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,070
then it will include k plus k prime plus
1 the student k prime plus 1

1122
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
1 the student k prime plus 1
 

1123
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,470
1 the student k prime plus 1
because you know otherwise there would

1124
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
because you know otherwise there would
 

1125
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,750
because you know otherwise there would
have been a match in in the things

1126
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
have been a match in in the things
 

1127
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,710
have been a match in in the things
before it

1128
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
before it
 

1129
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,870
before it
right so there are two cases if

1130
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
right so there are two cases if
 

1131
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,029
right so there are two cases if
k contains

1132
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039

 

1133
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,390

1135
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,830
match k prime if first k
contains match already

1136
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840

told you how to do that

1168
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
told you how to do that
 

1169
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,630
told you how to do that
yet but if i'm able to do that

1170
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
yet but if i'm able to do that
 

1171
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,230

i'm going to check if it's in the record

i'm going to check if it's in the record

i'm going to check if it's in the record
if it's in the record

1174
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
if it's in the record
 

1175
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,190
if it's in the record
then there will be a match and i can

1176
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
then there will be a match and i can
 

1177
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,630
then there will be a match and i can
return it otherwise

1178

1187
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,110

sense

1188
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120

1189
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:50,070

guys yeah okay so

1190
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080

 

1191
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,470

that's how we prove correctness this is

1192
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
that's how we prove correctness this is
 

1193
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,390
that's how we prove correctness this is
a little bit more formal than

1194
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
a little bit more formal than
 

1195
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,710
a little bit more formal than
we would ask you to do in this class all

1196
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
we would ask you to do in this class all
 

1197
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,630
we would ask you to do in this class all
the time but it's definitely

1198
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
the time but it's definitely
 

1199
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,110
the time but it's definitely
sufficient you know for the levels of

1200
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,120
sufficient you know for the levels of
 

1201
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,990
sufficient you know for the levels of
arguments

1202
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
arguments
 

1203
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,310
arguments
that we'll ask you to do the bar that

1204
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
that we'll ask you to do the bar that
 

1205
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,590
that we'll ask you to do the bar that
we're usually trying to set

1206
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
we're usually trying to set
 

1207
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,669
we're usually trying to set
is if you communicated to someone else

1208
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
is if you communicated to someone else
 

1209
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,430
is if you communicated to someone else
taking this class what your algorithm

1210
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
taking this class what your algorithm
 

1211
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,630
taking this class what your algorithm
was

1212
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
was
 

1213
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,149
was
they would be able to code it up and

1214
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
they would be able to code it up and
 

1215
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,310
they would be able to code it up and
tell a stupid computer how to do that

1216
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
tell a stupid computer how to do that
 

1217
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,350
tell a stupid computer how to do that
thing

1218
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
thing
 

1219
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,230
thing
okay so

1220
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240

 

1221
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,390

any any questions on induction

1222
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400

 

1223
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,750

you're going to be using it throughout

1224
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:27,760
you're going to be using it throughout
 

1225
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,750
you're going to be using it throughout
this class and so if you're

1226
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
this class and so if you're
 

1227
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,070
this class and so if you're
unfamiliar with this line of argument

1228
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
unfamiliar with this line of argument
 

1229
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,190
unfamiliar with this line of argument
then you should

1230
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
then you should
 

1231
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,950
then you should
go review some of that that would be

1232
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
go review some of that that would be
 

1233
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,390
go review some of that that would be
good okay

1234
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,400
good okay
 

1235
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,430
good okay
so that's correctness being able to

1236
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
so that's correctness being able to
 

1237
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,390
so that's correctness being able to
communicate that the problem the

1238
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
communicate that the problem the
 

1239
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,310
communicate that the problem the
algorithm we stated was

1240
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
algorithm we stated was
 

1241
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,630
algorithm we stated was
correct now we want to argue that it's

1242
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
correct now we want to argue that it's
 

1243
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,750
correct now we want to argue that it's
efficient

1244
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
efficient
 

1245
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:59,430
efficient
right what does efficiency mean

1246
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,440

 

1247
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,630

efficiency just means not only

1248
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
efficiency just means not only
 

1249
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,630
efficiency just means not only
how fast does this algorithm run but

1250
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
how fast does this algorithm run but
 

1251
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,789
how fast does this algorithm run but
how fast does it compare to other

1252
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
how fast does it compare to other
 

1253
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,070
how fast does it compare to other
possible ways of approaching this

1254
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
possible ways of approaching this
 

1255
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,029
possible ways of approaching this
problem

1256
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
problem
 

1257
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,870
problem
right so how could we measure how fast

1258
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
right so how could we measure how fast
 

1259
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,750
right so how could we measure how fast
an algorithm

1260
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
an algorithm
 

1261
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,830
an algorithm
runs this is

1262
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
runs this is
 

1263
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,669
runs this is
kind of a silly question yeah

1264
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679

 

1265
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,669

yeah just well i mean just record the

1266
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
yeah just well i mean just record the
 

1267
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,710
yeah just well i mean just record the
time it takes for a

1268
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
time it takes for a
 

1269
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,269
time it takes for a
computer to do this thing right now

1270
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
computer to do this thing right now
 

1271
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,269
computer to do this thing right now
there's a problem with just re

1272
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
there's a problem with just re
 

1273
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,269
there's a problem with just re
coding up an algorithm telling a

1274
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
coding up an algorithm telling a
 

1275
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,789
coding up an algorithm telling a
computer what to do

1276
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
computer what to do
 

1277
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,029
computer what to do
and timing how long it takes why

1278
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
and timing how long it takes why
 

1279
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,510
and timing how long it takes why
yeah it would depend on the size of your

1280
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
yeah it would depend on the size of your
 

1281
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,669
yeah it would depend on the size of your
data set okay we expect that but there's

1282
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
data set okay we expect that but there's
 

1283
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,149
data set okay we expect that but there's
a

1284
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159
a
 

1285
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,990
a
bigger problem there yeah

1286
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
bigger problem there yeah
 

1287
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,750
bigger problem there yeah
it depends on the strength of your

1288
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
it depends on the strength of your
 

1289
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,269
it depends on the strength of your
computer right

1290
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:53,279
computer right
 

1291
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,870
computer right
so i would expect that um you know

1292
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
so i would expect that um you know
 

1293
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,549
so i would expect that um you know
if i had a watch calculator and i

1294
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
if i had a watch calculator and i
 

1295
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,789
if i had a watch calculator and i
programmed it to do something

1296
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
programmed it to do something
 

1297
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,630
programmed it to do something
right that might take a lot longer

1298
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
right that might take a lot longer
 

1299
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,830
right that might take a lot longer
to solve a problem than if i asked

1300
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
to solve a problem than if i asked
 

1301
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,870
to solve a problem than if i asked
you know ibm's research computer

1302
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
you know ibm's research computer
 

1303
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,070
you know ibm's research computer
right to solve the same problem using

1304
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,080
right to solve the same problem using
 

1305
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,750
right to solve the same problem using
the same algorithm even with the same

1306
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:15,760
the same algorithm even with the same
 

1307
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,390
the same algorithm even with the same
code

1308
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
code
 

1309
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,750
code
right because its underlying operations

1310
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
right because its underlying operations
 

1311
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,710
right because its underlying operations
are much faster right how it runs is

1312
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
are much faster right how it runs is
 

1313
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,789
are much faster right how it runs is
much faster

1314
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
much faster
 

1315
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,470
much faster
so i don't want to count how long it

1316
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
so i don't want to count how long it
 

1317
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,830
so i don't want to count how long it
would take on a real machine

1318
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
would take on a real machine
 

1319
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,070
would take on a real machine
i kind of want to abstract the time it

1320
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
i kind of want to abstract the time it
 

1321
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,510
i kind of want to abstract the time it
takes the machine to do stuff

1322
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
takes the machine to do stuff
 

1323
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,430
takes the machine to do stuff
out of the picture what i kind of want

1324
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440
out of the picture what i kind of want
 

1325
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,950
out of the picture what i kind of want
to say is

1326
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
to say is
 

1327
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,470
to say is
let's assume that each kind of

1328
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
let's assume that each kind of
 

1329
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,470
let's assume that each kind of
fundamental operation that the computer

1330
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:38,480
fundamental operation that the computer
 

1331
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,350
fundamental operation that the computer
can do

1332
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
can do
 

1333
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,870
can do
takes some fixed amount of time okay

1334
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
takes some fixed amount of time okay
 

1335
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,950
takes some fixed amount of time okay
how many of those kinds of fixed

1336
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
how many of those kinds of fixed
 

1337
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,470
how many of those kinds of fixed
operations

1338
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
operations
 

1339
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,630
operations
does the algorithm need to perform to be

1340
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
does the algorithm need to perform to be
 

1341
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,110
does the algorithm need to perform to be
able to solve this problem

1342
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
able to solve this problem
 

1343
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,470
able to solve this problem
right so here we don't

1344
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480

 

1345
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,310

don't measure time

1346
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,320
don't measure time
 

1347
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,510
don't measure time
instead

1348
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:05,520

 

1349
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,990

count kind of fundamental operations

1350
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000
count kind of fundamental operations
 

1351
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,230
count kind of fundamental operations
okay we'll get to what some of those

1352
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
okay we'll get to what some of those
 

1353
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,950
okay we'll get to what some of those
fundamental operations are in a second

1354
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
fundamental operations are in a second
 

1355
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,990
fundamental operations are in a second
but the idea is

1356
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,000
but the idea is
 

1357
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,830
but the idea is
we want a measure of how well an

1358
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
we want a measure of how well an
 

1359
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,269
we want a measure of how well an
algorithm

1360
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
algorithm
 

1361
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,269
algorithm
uh performs not necessarily an

1362
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279

00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
and so what we're going to use to
 

1371
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,070
and so what we're going to use to

comparing functions using
 

1397
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,549
comparing functions using
an asymptotic analysis but just to give

00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
an asymptotic analysis but just to give
 

1399
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,190

you an idea

1400
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,200
you an idea
 

1401
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,630
you an idea
right the idea here is we don't measure

1402
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
right the idea here is we don't measure
 

1403
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,389
right the idea here is we don't measure
time we instead measure ops

1404
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
time we instead measure ops
 

1405
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,230
time we instead measure ops
and like your colleague over here was

1406
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,240
and like your colleague over here was
 

1407
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,310
and like your colleague over here was
saying before we expect

1408
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320

 

1409
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,350

uh performance

1410
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,360
uh performance
 

1411
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,950
uh performance
i'm going to use performance instead of

1412
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:22,960
i'm going to use performance instead of
 

1413
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,029
i'm going to use performance instead of
time here we expect that to depend

1414
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039

 

1415
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,070

on size of

1416
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,080
on size of
 

1417
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,470
on size of
our input right if we're trying to

1418
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,480
our input right if we're trying to
 

1419
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,510
our input right if we're trying to
run an algorithm to find a birthday

1420
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
run an algorithm to find a birthday
 

1421
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,549
run an algorithm to find a birthday
uh in this section

1422
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559
uh in this section
 

1423
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,950
uh in this section
we expect the algorithm to run in a

1424
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
we expect the algorithm to run in a
 

1425
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,870
we expect the algorithm to run in a
shorter amount of time than if i were to

1426
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
shorter amount of time than if i were to
 

1427
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,549
shorter amount of time than if i were to
run the algorithm on all of you right

1428
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:50,559
run the algorithm on all of you right
 

1429
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,269
run the algorithm on all of you right
so we expect it to perform differently

1430
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
so we expect it to perform differently
 

1431
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,870
so we expect it to perform differently
depending on the size of the input

1432
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:54,880
depending on the size of the input
 

1433
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,549
depending on the size of the input
and how differently uh is how we measure

1434
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
and how differently uh is how we measure
 

1435
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,110
and how differently uh is how we measure
performance uh relative that input

1436
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
performance uh relative that input
 

1437
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,909
performance uh relative that input
usually we use

1438
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
usually we use
 

1439
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,110
usually we use
n as a variable for what the size of our

1440
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,120
n as a variable for what the size of our
 

1441
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,389
n as a variable for what the size of our
input is

1442
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
input is
 

1443
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,149
input is
right but that's not always the case so

1444
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:08,159
right but that's not always the case so
 

1445
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,750
right but that's not always the case so
for example if we have a

1446
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:09,760
for example if we have a
 

1447
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,190
for example if we have a
an array that i give you an n by n ray

1448
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200
an array that i give you an n by n ray
 

1449
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,070
an array that i give you an n by n ray
right that we're going to say n but

1450
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
right that we're going to say n but
 

1451
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,350
right that we're going to say n but
what's the size of our input how much

1452
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,360
what's the size of our input how much
 

1453
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,110
what's the size of our input how much
information do i need to convey to you

1454
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
information do i need to convey to you
 

1455
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,950
information do i need to convey to you
to give you that information

1456
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
to give you that information
 

1457
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,870
to give you that information
it's n squared right so that's the size

1458
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:24,880
it's n squared right so that's the size
 

1459
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,990
it's n squared right so that's the size
of our input in that

1460
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,000
of our input in that
 

1461
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,710
of our input in that
that context right or if i give you a

1462
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
that context right or if i give you a
 

1463
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,870
that context right or if i give you a
graph it's usually the number of

1464
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
graph it's usually the number of
 

1465
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,789
graph it's usually the number of
vertices plus the number of edges that's

1466
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
vertices plus the number of edges that's
 

1467
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,190
vertices plus the number of edges that's
how big how much space i would need to

1468
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200
how big how much space i would need to
 

1469
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,389
how big how much space i would need to
convey to you

1470
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
convey to you
 

1471
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,310
convey to you
that graph that information okay so you

1472
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
that graph that information okay so you
 

1473
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,310
that graph that information okay so you
we compare how fast an algorithm is

1474
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
we compare how fast an algorithm is
 

1475
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,710
we compare how fast an algorithm is

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,590
linear algorithm a linear time algorithm
right that's basically saying that the

1532
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
right that's basically saying that the
 

1533
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,070
right that's basically saying that the
side

1534
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
side
 

1535
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,590
side
the running time of my algorithm the

1536
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
the running time of my algorithm the
 

1537
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,350
the running time of my algorithm the
performance of my algorithm

1538
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
performance of my algorithm
 

1539
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,350
performance of my algorithm
is linear with respect to the size of my

1540
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,360
is linear with respect to the size of my
 

1541
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,470
is linear with respect to the size of my
input right

1542
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
input right
 

1543
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,110
input right
yeah say it again

1544
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120

 

1545
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,590

like putting something in a list okay so

1546
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
like putting something in a list okay so
 

1547
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,470
like putting something in a list okay so
that's

1548
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
that's
 

1549
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,789
that's
there's there's a lot behind that

1550
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:30,799
there's there's a lot behind that
 

1551
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,870
there's there's a lot behind that
question that we'll go into later

1552
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:32,880
question that we'll go into later
 

1553
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,590
question that we'll go into later
uh this week uh but that's an example of

1554
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,600
uh this week uh but that's an example of
 

1555
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,509
uh this week uh but that's an example of
if i do it in a silly way

1556
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
if i do it in a silly way
 

1557
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,870
if i do it in a silly way
i stick something in the middle of a

1558
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
i stick something in the middle of a
 

1559
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,029
i stick something in the middle of a
list and i have to move everything

1560
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:41,039
list and i have to move everything
 

1561
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,549
list and i have to move everything
that's an operation that could take

1562
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
that's an operation that could take
 

1563
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,549
that's an operation that could take
linear time right

1564
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
linear time right
 

1565
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,149
linear time right
okay so uh linear time is is a type of

1566
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
okay so uh linear time is is a type of
 

1567
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:48,630
okay so uh linear time is is a type of
function

1568
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:48,640
function
 

1569
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,470
function
we've got a number of these i'm going to

1570
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,480
we've got a number of these i'm going to
 

1571
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,789
we've got a number of these i'm going to
start with uh

1572
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
start with uh
 

1573
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,630
start with uh
this one does anyone know what this one

1574
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:54,640
this one does anyone know what this one
 

1575
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,789
this one does anyone know what this one
is constant time

1576
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:56,799
is constant time
 

1577
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,110
is constant time
okay basically no matter how i change

1578
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,120
okay basically no matter how i change
 

1579
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,789
okay basically no matter how i change
the input

1580
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
the input
 

1581
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,269
the input
the amount of time this running time the

1582
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
the amount of time this running time the
 

1583
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,669
the amount of time this running time the
the performance of my algorithm takes

1584
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
the performance of my algorithm takes
 

1585
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,669
the performance of my algorithm takes
it doesn't really depend on that okay

1586
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
it doesn't really depend on that okay
 

1587
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,470
it doesn't really depend on that okay
the next one up is

1588
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
the next one up is
 

1589
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,909
the next one up is
something like this this is logarithmic

1590
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:13,919
something like this this is logarithmic
 

1591
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,029
something like this this is logarithmic
time

1592
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
time
 

1593
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,549
time
okay we have

1594
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
okay we have
 

1595
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,549
okay we have
theta n which is linear

1596
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:22,559

 

1597
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,590

and log n right

1598
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:25,600
and log n right
 

1599
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,590
and log n right
sometimes we call this log linear but we

1600
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
sometimes we call this log linear but we
 

1601
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,750
sometimes we call this log linear but we
usually just say n log n

1602
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,760
usually just say n log n
 

1603
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,870
usually just say n log n
okay we have a quadratic running time in

1604
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:32,880
okay we have a quadratic running time in
 

1605
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,430
okay we have a quadratic running time in
general

1606
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
general
 

1607
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,830
general
if i have a constant power up here

1608
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:36,840
if i have a constant power up here
 

1609
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,630
if i have a constant power up here
right it's n to the c

1610
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,640
right it's n to the c
 

1611
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,950
right it's n to the c
for some constant this is what we call

1612
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:42,960
for some constant this is what we call
 

1613
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,149
for some constant this is what we call
polynomial time

1614
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
polynomial time
 

1615
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,310
polynomial time
right we're as long as c is some

1616
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
right we're as long as c is some
 

1617
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,389
right we're as long as c is some
constant

1618
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
constant
 

1619
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,669
constant
and this right here is what we mean by

1620
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:51,679
and this right here is what we mean by
 

1621
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,789
and this right here is what we mean by
efficient in this class usually right in

1622
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:54,799
efficient in this class usually right in
 

1623
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,870
efficient in this class usually right in
other classes right when you have big

1624
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:56,880
other classes right when you have big
 

1625
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,470
other classes right when you have big
data sets maybe this is

1626
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,480
data sets maybe this is
 

1627
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,789
data sets maybe this is
efficient right but in this class

1628
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
efficient right but in this class
 

1629
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,310
efficient right but in this class
generally what we mean

1630
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
generally what we mean
 

1631
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,669
generally what we mean
is polynomial and as you get down this

1632
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:05,679
is polynomial and as you get down this
 

1633
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,470
is polynomial and as you get down this
thing these are

1634
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480
thing these are
 

1635
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,750
thing these are
things are more and more efficient okay

1636
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:09,760
things are more and more efficient okay
 

1637
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,190
things are more and more efficient okay
there's one class i'm going to talk to

1638
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
there's one class i'm going to talk to
 

1639
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,109
there's one class i'm going to talk to
you about over here

1640
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,119
you about over here
 

1641
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,470
you about over here
which is something like uh

1642
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
which is something like uh
 

1643
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,510
which is something like uh
let's do this 2 to the theta

1644
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
let's do this 2 to the theta
 

1645
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,430
let's do this 2 to the theta
of n right exponential time

1646
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
of n right exponential time
 

1647
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,430
of n right exponential time
this is some constant to a function of n

1648
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
this is some constant to a function of n
 

1649
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,470
this is some constant to a function of n
that's say super linear

1650
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
that's say super linear
 

1651
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,589
that's say super linear
uh that's going to be uh

1652
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:33,599
uh that's going to be uh
 

1653
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,430
uh that's going to be uh
you know pretty bad why is it pretty bad

1654
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,440
you know pretty bad why is it pretty bad
 

1655
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,149
you know pretty bad why is it pretty bad
if i were to plot some of these things

1656
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,159

 

1657
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,510

as a function of n right let's say

1658
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,520
as a function of n right let's say
 

1659
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,030
as a function of n right let's say
i plot values of up to a thousand on

1660
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,040
i plot values of up to a thousand on
 

1661
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,790
i plot values of up to a thousand on
on my n scale here okay

1662
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:50,800
on my n scale here okay
 

1663
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,710
on my n scale here okay
what does constant look like maybe this

1664
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:52,720
what does constant look like maybe this
 

1665
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,629
what does constant look like maybe this
is a thousand up here too

1666
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:56,639

 

1667
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,710

what does a constant look like looks

1668
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:58,720
what does a constant look like looks
 

1669
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,750
what does a constant look like looks
like a line

1670
00:34:59,750 --> 00:34:59,760
like a line
 

1671
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,310
like a line
right it looks like a line over here

1672
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
right it looks like a line over here
 

1673
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,710
right it looks like a line over here
somewhere it could be as high as i want

1674
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
somewhere it could be as high as i want
 

1675
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,710
somewhere it could be as high as i want
but eventually anything that's an

1676
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
but eventually anything that's an
 

1677
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,069
but eventually anything that's an
increasing function

1678
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
increasing function
 

1679
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,349
increasing function
will get bigger than this right and on

1680
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
will get bigger than this right and on
 

1681
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,550
will get bigger than this right and on
this scale if i

1682
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
this scale if i
 

1683
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,430
this scale if i
use log base 2 or some reasonable small

1684
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,440
use log base 2 or some reasonable small
 

1685
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,790
use log base 2 or some reasonable small
constant

1686
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
constant
 

1687
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,390
constant
what does log look like well let's let's

1688
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
what does log look like well let's let's
 

1689
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,829
what does log look like well let's let's
do an easier one what does linear look

1690
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
do an easier one what does linear look
 

1691
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,109
do an easier one what does linear look
like

1692
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:23,119
like
 

1693
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,390
like
yeah this right that's what i saw a lot

1694
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
yeah this right that's what i saw a lot
 

1695
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,589
yeah this right that's what i saw a lot
of you doing

1696
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:27,599
of you doing
 

1697
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,030
of you doing
okay that's linear that's the kind of

1698
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
okay that's linear that's the kind of
 

1699
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,790
okay that's linear that's the kind of
base that we're comparing everything

1700
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:32,800
base that we're comparing everything
 

1701
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,550
base that we're comparing everything
against what does log look like

1702
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,560
against what does log look like
 

1703
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,390
against what does log look like
like this okay but on at this scale

1704
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:40,400
like this okay but on at this scale
 

1705
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,430
like this okay but on at this scale
right at this scale

1706
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,440
right at this scale
 

1707
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,109
right at this scale
really it's much closer to constant

1708
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
really it's much closer to constant
 

1709
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,150
really it's much closer to constant
than linear and actually as n gets much

1710
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,160
than linear and actually as n gets much
 

1711
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,430
than linear and actually as n gets much
much larger

1712
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:51,440
much larger
 

1713
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,030
much larger
this almost looks like a straight line

1714
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,040
this almost looks like a straight line
 

1715
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,190
this almost looks like a straight line
it almost looks like a constant

1716
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
it almost looks like a constant
 

1717
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,150
it almost looks like a constant
so log is almost just as good as

1718
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
so log is almost just as good as
 

1719
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,950
so log is almost just as good as
constant

1720
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:58,960
constant
 

1721
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,589
constant
right what does exponential look like

1722
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:03,599

 

1723
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,910

it's the exact inverse of this thing

1724
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
it's the exact inverse of this thing
 

1725
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,190
it's the exact inverse of this thing
right

1726
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
right
 

1727
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,990
right
right it's almost an exact straight line

1728
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
right it's almost an exact straight line
 

1729
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,030
right it's almost an exact straight line
going up

1730
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
going up
 

1731
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,390
going up
right so this is crap

1732
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,400
right so this is crap
 

1733
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,430
right so this is crap
this is really good almost anything in

1734
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,440
this is really good almost anything in
 

1735
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,430
this is really good almost anything in
this region over here is

1736
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
this region over here is
 

1737
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,349
this region over here is
better right at least i'm gaining

1738
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:21,359
better right at least i'm gaining
 

1739
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,470
better right at least i'm gaining
something

1740
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,480

 

1741
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,510

uh i i'm not i'm i'm able to not go

1742
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
uh i i'm not i'm i'm able to not go
 

1743
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,430
uh i i'm not i'm i'm able to not go
up too high relative to my input size so

1744
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:31,440
up too high relative to my input size so
 

1745
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,109
up too high relative to my input size so
quadratic i don't know something like

1746
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
quadratic i don't know something like
 

1747
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,430
quadratic i don't know something like
this

1748
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
this
 

1749
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,430
this
and n log n is something like this and

1750
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,440
and n log n is something like this and
 

1751
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,510
and n log n is something like this and
log n after a long time

1752
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,520
log n after a long time
 

1753
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,910
log n after a long time
really starts just looking linear with a

1754
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:39,920
really starts just looking linear with a
 

1755
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,349
really starts just looking linear with a
a constant multiplied

1756
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:41,359
a constant multiplied
 

1757
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,109
a constant multiplied
in front of it right okay so

1758
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,119
in front of it right okay so
 

1759
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,150
in front of it right okay so
these things good that thing bad okay

1760
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,160
these things good that thing bad okay
 

1761
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,790
these things good that thing bad okay
that's what that's trying to convey all

1762
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,800
that's what that's trying to convey all
 

1763
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,670
that's what that's trying to convey all
right

1764
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
right
 

1765
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,190
right
so how do we measure these things if

1766
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,200
so how do we measure these things if
 

1767
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,109
so how do we measure these things if
if i don't know what my fundamental

1768
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
if i don't know what my fundamental
 

1769
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,990
if i don't know what my fundamental
operations are that my computer can

operations are that my computer can
 

1771
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,670
operations are that my computer can
can can use right so we need to define

1772
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:03,680
can can use right so we need to define
 

1773
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:12,630
can can use right so we need to define
some kind of model of computation

1774
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:12,640

 

1775
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,030

for what our computer is allowed to do

1776
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,040
for what our computer is allowed to do
 

1777
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,109
for what our computer is allowed to do
in constant time in a fixed amount of

right

1782
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040

 

1783
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,190

in general what we use in this class is

1784
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,200
in general what we use in this class is
 

1785
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,190
in general what we use in this class is
is a machine called a word ram

brevity all right word ram
 

1793
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,990
brevity all right word ram
it's kind of a loaded term

1794
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,000
it's kind of a loaded term
 

1795
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,030
it's kind of a loaded term
what do these things mean it means i

what can some does someone know what ram

1800
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,320
what can some does someone know what ram
 

1801
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,270
what can some does someone know what ram
means

1802
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280

 

1803
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,430

random access memory right it means that

1804
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,440
random access memory right it means that
 

1805
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,390
random access memory right it means that
i can

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,750
i can
randomly access different places in

00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760
randomly access different places in
 

1809
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,030
randomly access different places in

1811
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,790

in constant time that's that's the

1812
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800
in constant time that's that's the
 

1813
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,069
in constant time that's that's the
assumption of

assumption of
 

1815
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,470
assumption of
random access memory basically what our

1816
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:58,480
random access memory basically what our
 

1817
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,069
random access memory basically what our
model of a computer is is you have

1818
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:00,079
model of a computer is is you have
 

1819
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,870
model of a computer is is you have
memory

1820
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:01,880
memory
 

1821
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,790
memory
memory which is essentially just a

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
memory which is essentially just a
 

1823
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,470
memory which is essentially just a
string of bits

1824
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
string of bits
 

1825
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,030
string of bits
it's just a bunch of ones and zeros

1826
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
it's just a bunch of ones and zeros
 

1827
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,550
it's just a bunch of ones and zeros
right

1828
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
right
 

1829
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,150
right
and we have a computer like a cpu right

1830
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160
and we have a computer like a cpu right
 

1831
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,589
and we have a computer like a cpu right
which is really small it can basically

1832
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:17,599
which is really small it can basically
 

1833
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,670
which is really small it can basically
hold a small amount of information but

1834
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:19,680
hold a small amount of information but
 

1835
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,550
hold a small amount of information but
it can

1836
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:20,560
it can
 

1837
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,950
it can
change that information right it can

1838
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:22,960
change that information right it can
 

1839
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,630
change that information right it can
operate on that information

1840
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:24,640
operate on that information
 

1841
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,630
operate on that information
and it also has instructions to randomly

1842
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:26,640
and it also has instructions to randomly
 

1843
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,310
and it also has instructions to randomly
access different places in memory bring

1844
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,320
access different places in memory bring
 

1845
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,829
access different places in memory bring
it into the cpu act on it and read it

1846
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:30,839
it into the cpu act on it and read it
 

1847
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,150
it into the cpu act on it and read it
back

1848
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,160
back
 

1849
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,349
back
that makes sense but in general

1850
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:35,359
that makes sense but in general
 

1851
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,630
that makes sense but in general
we don't have an address for every bit

1852
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:38,640
we don't have an address for every bit
 

1853
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,430
we don't have an address for every bit
in memory every zero and one in memory

1854
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:43,440

 

1855
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,910

we actually does anyone know how modern

1856
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:45,920
we actually does anyone know how modern
 

1857
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:54,550
we actually does anyone know how modern
computers are addressed

1858
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,560

 

1859
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,589

okay so so we're gonna get there

1860
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
okay so so we're gonna get there
 

1861
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,230
okay so so we're gonna get there
actually

1862
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,240
actually
 

1863
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,910
actually
what a modern computer is addressed in

1864
00:38:59,910 --> 00:38:59,920
what a modern computer is addressed in
 

1865
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,829
what a modern computer is addressed in
is bytes okay

1866
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:01,839
is bytes okay
 

1867
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,990
is bytes okay
collections of eight bits so there's an

1868
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,000
collections of eight bits so there's an
 

1869
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,109
collections of eight bits so there's an
address

1873
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,030
i have for every eight bits in memory
consecutive eight bits in memory and so

1874
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,040
consecutive eight bits in memory and so
 

1875
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,550
consecutive eight bits in memory and so
if i want to pull something in into the

00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
if i want to pull something in into the
 

1877
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,710
if i want to pull something in into the
cpu i give it an address it'll take

1878
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:12,720
cpu i give it an address it'll take
 

1879
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,310

some chunk right and bring it into the
 

1881
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,230
some chunk right and bring it into the
the cpu operate it on it and spit it

1882
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,240
the cpu operate it on it and spit it
 

1883
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,670
the cpu operate it on it and spit it
back okay

1884
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
back okay
 

1885
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,109
back okay
how big is that chunk

1886
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119

were
 

1891
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,829
were
asking which or saying which is

1892
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:29,839
asking which or saying which is
 

1893
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,069
asking which or saying which is

my word size was 32 bits

1918
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
my word size was 32 bits
 

1919
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,150
my word size was 32 bits
and that actually was a problem for my

1920
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,160
and that actually was a problem for my
 

1921
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,349
and that actually was a problem for my
computer

computer
 

1923
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,870
computer
because

1924
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:06,880

 

1925
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,950

in order for me to be able to read to

1926
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:08,960
in order for me to be able to read to
 

1927

1929
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,309

i need to be able to store that address

1930
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
i need to be able to store that address
 

1931
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,550
i need to be able to store that address
in my cpu in a word

1932
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:16,560
in my cpu in a word
 

1933
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,349
in my cpu in a word
right but if i have 32 bits

1934
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:21,359
right but if i have 32 bits
 

1935
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,510
right but if i have 32 bits
how many different addresses can i

1936
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
how many different addresses can i
 

1937
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,550
how many different addresses can i
address

1938
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
address
 

1939
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,390
address
i have a limitation on the memory

1940
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
i have a limitation on the memory
 

1941
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,710
i have a limitation on the memory
addresses i can address right

1942
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:28,720
addresses i can address right
 

1943
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,309
addresses i can address right
so how many different memory addresses

1944
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:30,319
so how many different memory addresses
 

1945
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,030
so how many different memory addresses
can i address with 32 bits

1946
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,040
can i address with 32 bits
 

1947
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,910
can i address with 32 bits
2 to the 32 right that makes sense well

1948
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
2 to the 32 right that makes sense well
 

1949
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,270
2 to the 32 right that makes sense well
if you do that

1950
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,280
if you do that
 

1951
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,309
if you do that

2034
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:26,400
on most cpus
 

2035
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,990
on most cpus
some cpus give you a little bit more

2036
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,000
some cpus give you a little bit more
 

2037
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,069
some cpus give you a little bit more
power but this is generally

2038
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:30,079
power but this is generally
 

2039
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,069
power but this is generally
what we analyze algorithms with respect

2040
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:32,079
what we analyze algorithms with respect
 

2041
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,470
what we analyze algorithms with respect
to okay

2042
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,480

 

2043
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,950

but you'll notice that my cpu is only

2044
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
but you'll notice that my cpu is only
 

2045
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,950
but you'll notice that my cpu is only
built to operate on a constant amount of

2046
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:40,960
built to operate on a constant amount of
 

2047
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,150
built to operate on a constant amount of
information at once

2048
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,160
information at once
 

2049
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,750
information at once
generally two words in memory

2050
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:45,760
generally two words in memory
 

2051
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,470
generally two words in memory
an operation produces a third one and i

2052
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480
an operation produces a third one and i
 

2053
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,589
an operation produces a third one and i
spit it out right

2054
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:51,599

 

2055
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,349

it takes a constant amount of time to

2056
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:53,359
it takes a constant amount of time to
 

2057
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,870
it takes a constant amount of time to
operate on a constant amount of memory

2058
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880
operate on a constant amount of memory
 

2059
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,630
operate on a constant amount of memory
if i want to operate on a linear amount

2060
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:56,640
if i want to operate on a linear amount
 

2061
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,109
if i want to operate on a linear amount
of memory

2062
00:42:59,109 --> 00:42:59,119
of memory
 

2063
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,109
of memory
end things how long is that going to

2064
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
end things how long is that going to
 

2065
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,390
end things how long is that going to
take

2066
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,400
take
 

2067
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,190
take
right if i just want to read everything

2068
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
right if i just want to read everything
 

2069
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,470
right if i just want to read everything
in that thing it's going to take me

2070
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480
in that thing it's going to take me
 

2071
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,550
in that thing it's going to take me
linear time right because i have to read

2072
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:08,560
linear time right because i have to read
 

2073
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,309
linear time right because i have to read
every part of that thing okay

2074
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
every part of that thing okay
 

2075
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,870
every part of that thing okay
so in general what we're going to do for

2076
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:14,880
so in general what we're going to do for
 

2077
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,510
so in general what we're going to do for
the first

2078
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
the first
 

2079
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,630
the first
half of this class mostly first eight

2080
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:18,640
half of this class mostly first eight
 

2081
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,829
half of this class mostly first eight
lectures anyway

2082
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
lectures anyway
 

2083
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:27,589
lectures anyway
is talk about data structures

2084
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:27,599
is talk about data structures
 

2085
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,309
is talk about data structures
and it's going to be concerned about not

2086
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
and it's going to be concerned about not
 

2087
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,309
and it's going to be concerned about not
operating on constant amount of data at

2088
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:32,319
operating on constant amount of data at
 

2089
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,309
operating on constant amount of data at
a time like our cpu is

2090
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
a time like our cpu is
 

2091
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,829
a time like our cpu is
uh doing but instead what it's going to

2092
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:37,839
uh doing but instead what it's going to
 

2093
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,349
uh doing but instead what it's going to
do is operate

2094
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:39,359
do is operate
 

2095
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,069
do is operate
on store a large amount of data and

2096
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
on store a large amount of data and
 

2097
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,910
on store a large amount of data and
support different operations on that

2098
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:43,920
support different operations on that
 

2099
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,630
support different operations on that
data

2100
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:44,640
data
 

2101
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,670
data
okay so if i had a record that i want to

2102
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,680
okay so if i had a record that i want to
 

2103
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,270
okay so if i had a record that i want to
maintain to store those birthdays that

2104
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:49,280
maintain to store those birthdays that
 

2105
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,390
maintain to store those birthdays that
we had before

2106
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400

 

2107
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,470

i might use something like a static

2108
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:54,480
i might use something like a static
 

2109
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,670
i might use something like a static
array

2110
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
array
 

2111
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,470
array
right which you guys maybe are not

2112
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
right which you guys maybe are not
 

2113
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,589
right which you guys maybe are not
familiar with

2114
00:43:59,589 --> 00:43:59,599
familiar with
 

2115
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,510
familiar with
if you have been working in python as

2116
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
if you have been working in python as
 

2117
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,190
if you have been working in python as
your only programming language

2118
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
your only programming language
 

2119
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,670
your only programming language
okay python has a lot of really

2120
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:05,680
okay python has a lot of really
 

2121
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,510
okay python has a lot of really
interesting data structures like a list

2122
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,520
interesting data structures like a list
 

2123
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,190
interesting data structures like a list
and a set and a dictionary and all these

2124
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,200
and a set and a dictionary and all these
 

2125
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,710
and a set and a dictionary and all these
kinds of things

2126
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:10,720
kinds of things
 

2127
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,670
kinds of things
that are actually not in this model

2128
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:13,680
that are actually not in this model
 

2129
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,550
that are actually not in this model
there's actually

2130
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:14,560
there's actually
 

2131
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,030
there's actually
a lot of code between you and the

2132
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,040
a lot of code between you and the
 

2133
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,069
a lot of code between you and the
computer

2134
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,079
computer
 

2135
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,470
computer
and it's not always clear how much time

2136
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:20,480
and it's not always clear how much time
 

2137
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,270
and it's not always clear how much time
that

2138
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280
that
 

2139
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,790
that
interface is taking right and so we're

2140
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:24,800
interface is taking right and so we're
 

2141
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,270
interface is taking right and so we're
going to do

2142
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
going to do
 

2143
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,390
going to do
starting on thursday is talk about

2144
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:28,400
starting on thursday is talk about
 

2145
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,069
starting on thursday is talk about
ways of storing a non-constant amount of

2146
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:32,079
ways of storing a non-constant amount of
 

2147
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,910
ways of storing a non-constant amount of
information to make operations on that

2148
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:33,920
information to make operations on that
 

2149
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,270
information to make operations on that
information faster

2150
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
information faster
 

2151
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,630
information faster
so just before you go i just want to

2152
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
so just before you go i just want to
 

2153
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,309
so just before you go i just want to
give you a quick

2154
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
give you a quick
 

2155
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,270
give you a quick
overview of the class to solve an

2156
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,280
overview of the class to solve an
 

2157
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,630
overview of the class to solve an
algorithms class in

2158
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
algorithms class in
 

2159
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,069
algorithms class in
algorithm problem in this class we

2160
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079
algorithm problem in this class we
 

2161
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,829
algorithm problem in this class we
essentially have two different

2162
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:48,839
essentially have two different
 

2163
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,589
essentially have two different
strategies we can either reduce just to

2164
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
strategies we can either reduce just to
 

2165
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,470
strategies we can either reduce just to
using

2166
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
using
 

2167
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,309
using
the solution to a problem we know how to

2168
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
the solution to a problem we know how to
 

2169
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,510
the solution to a problem we know how to
solve

2170
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:55,520
solve
 

2171
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,589
solve
or we can design our own algorithm which

2172
00:44:57,589 --> 00:44:57,599
or we can design our own algorithm which
 

2173
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,390
or we can design our own algorithm which
is going to be recursive in nature

2174
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
is going to be recursive in nature
 

2175
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,670
is going to be recursive in nature
we're going to either put stuff in the

2176
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,680
we're going to either put stuff in the
 

2177
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,670
we're going to either put stuff in the
data structure and solve a sorting

2178
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:03,680
data structure and solve a sorting
 

2179
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,470
data structure and solve a sorting
problem

2180
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,480
problem
 

2181
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,510
problem
or search in a graph and then to design

a recursive algorithm
we have various design paradigms this is

2186
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
we have various design paradigms this is
 

2187
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,710
we have various design paradigms this is
all in your notes

2188
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
all in your notes
 

2189
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,470
all in your notes
but this is essentially the structure of

2190
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
but this is essentially the structure of
 

2191
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,069
but this is essentially the structure of
the class we're going to spend

2192
