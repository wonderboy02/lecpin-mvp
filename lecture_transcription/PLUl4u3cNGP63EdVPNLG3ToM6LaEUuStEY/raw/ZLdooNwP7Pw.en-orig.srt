uh this week we're going to cover some
 

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,150
uh this week we're going to cover some
problems in graph theory related to

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
problems in graph theory related to
 

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,429
problems in graph theory related to
death for search and breadth first

14
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
death for search and breadth first
 

15
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,109
death for search and breadth first
search which were roughly the topics

16
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
search which were roughly the topics
 

17
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,230
search which were roughly the topics
that i guess we've covered in the last

18
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
that i guess we've covered in the last
 

19
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,429
that i guess we've covered in the last
couple lectures and what's going to be

20
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
couple lectures and what's going to be
 

21
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,470
couple lectures and what's going to be
on your homework

22
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
on your homework
 

23
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,990
on your homework
uh and i believe this is basically the

24
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
uh and i believe this is basically the
 

25
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,990
uh and i believe this is basically the
homework from from last year uh

26
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
homework from from last year uh
 

27
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,950
homework from from last year uh
with a few revisions uh based on some

28
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
with a few revisions uh based on some
 

29
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,470
with a few revisions uh based on some
typos we cut

30
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
typos we cut
 

31
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,750
typos we cut
oh and i caught a spelling mistake that

32
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
oh and i caught a spelling mistake that
 

33
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,910
oh and i caught a spelling mistake that
i'll bother our instructor about later

34
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
i'll bother our instructor about later
 

35
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,549
i'll bother our instructor about later
okay uh so without further ado let's get

36
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
okay uh so without further ado let's get
 

37
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,670
okay uh so without further ado let's get
started i guess we'll just do them in

38
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
started i guess we'll just do them in
 

39
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,750
started i guess we'll just do them in
order for lack of creativity here

40
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
order for lack of creativity here
 

41
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,510
order for lack of creativity here
um the very first problem has to do with

42
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
um the very first problem has to do with
 

43
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,110
um the very first problem has to do with
some measurements on a graph

44
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
some measurements on a graph
 

45
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,189
some measurements on a graph
uh which is actually a really

46
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
uh which is actually a really
 

47
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,630
uh which is actually a really
interesting one to me so it turns out

48
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
interesting one to me so it turns out
 

49
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,549
interesting one to me so it turns out
that in a lot of research in

50
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
that in a lot of research in
 

51
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,750
that in a lot of research in
for some reason in computer science

52
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
for some reason in computer science
 

53
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,430
for some reason in computer science
there's graph theory research and then

54
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
there's graph theory research and then
 

55
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,270
there's graph theory research and then
there's networks research and these are

56
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
there's networks research and these are
 

57
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,470
there's networks research and these are
two different

58
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
two different
 

59
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,710
two different
communities for weird historical reasons

60
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
communities for weird historical reasons
 

61
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,630
communities for weird historical reasons
that i don't totally understand

62
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
that i don't totally understand
 

63
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,310
that i don't totally understand
but people in the network science

64
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
but people in the network science
 

65
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,990
but people in the network science
literature often measure

66
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
literature often measure
 

67
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,590
literature often measure
things like the radius of a graph and

68
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
things like the radius of a graph and
 

69
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,670
things like the radius of a graph and
some other kind of measures that are

70
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
some other kind of measures that are
 

71
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,870
some other kind of measures that are
trying to tell you something about like

72
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
trying to tell you something about like
 

73
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,030
trying to tell you something about like
is a graph a long spread out thing like

74
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
is a graph a long spread out thing like
 

75
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,310
is a graph a long spread out thing like
a line graph or

76
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
a line graph or
 

77
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,550
a line graph or
something super compact like a star and

78
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
something super compact like a star and
 

79
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,550
something super compact like a star and
so on uh and so this problem is kind of

80
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
so on uh and so this problem is kind of
 

81
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,789
so on uh and so this problem is kind of
digging into the algorithmic aspects

82
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
digging into the algorithmic aspects
 

83
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,990
digging into the algorithmic aspects
of how we might compute one of the

84
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
of how we might compute one of the
 

85
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,149
of how we might compute one of the
measurements that i believe is is

86
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
measurements that i believe is is
 

87
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,830
measurements that i believe is is
fairly common in in that community

88
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
fairly common in in that community
 

89
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,749
fairly common in in that community
uh so let's uh kind of go through these

90
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
uh so let's uh kind of go through these
 

91
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,230
uh so let's uh kind of go through these
problems as usual in 6006 we like to

92
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
problems as usual in 6006 we like to
 

93
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,429
problems as usual in 6006 we like to
take

94
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
take
 

95
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,630
take
actually relatively straightforward

96
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
actually relatively straightforward
 

97
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,149
actually relatively straightforward
computational problems and then dress

98
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
computational problems and then dress
 

99
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,910
computational problems and then dress
them up with a lot of language to make

100
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
them up with a lot of language to make
 

101
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,749
them up with a lot of language to make
it annoying for you guys to parse

102
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
it annoying for you guys to parse
 

103
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,830
it annoying for you guys to parse
and indeed this problem is no exception

104
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
and indeed this problem is no exception
 

105
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,389
and indeed this problem is no exception
to that uh so in this problem we're

106
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
to that uh so in this problem we're
 

107
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,270
to that uh so in this problem we're
given an

108
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
given an
 

109
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,510
given an
undirected graph

110
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520

 

111
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,469

uh and as usual we will call him g

112
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479

 

113
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,789

uh and we define a particular number

114
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
uh and we define a particular number
 

115
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,910
uh and we define a particular number
that we're trying to measure

116
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
that we're trying to measure
 

117
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,069
that we're trying to measure
in this in in this problem right so uh

118
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
in this in in this problem right so uh
 

119
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,990
in this in in this problem right so uh
in particular uh

120
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
in particular uh
 

121
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,589
in particular uh
right if we given a given a vertex v

122
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
right if we given a given a vertex v
 

123
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,350
right if we given a given a vertex v
uh then we can define something called

124
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
uh then we can define something called
 

125
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,670
uh then we can define something called
the eccentricity of v

126
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
the eccentricity of v
 

127
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,910
the eccentricity of v
which is the distance to the farthest

128
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
which is the distance to the farthest
 

129
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,949
which is the distance to the farthest
away uh

130
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
away uh
 

131
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,550
away uh
thing so in particular um we can define

132
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560

 

133
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,750

um is going to be given by

134
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
um is going to be given by
 

135
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,790
um is going to be given by
the following which is the max

136
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
the following which is the max
 

137
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,830
the following which is the max
over all the possible i'll try to make

138
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
over all the possible i'll try to make
 

139
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,309
over all the possible i'll try to make
sure my notation

140
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
sure my notation
 

141
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,869
sure my notation
oops i've already oh that's okay uh

142
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879

 

143
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,550

over all the other vertices of the

144
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
over all the other vertices of the
 

145
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,070
over all the other vertices of the
distance from

146
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
distance from
 

147
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,110
distance from
uh v to w

148
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
uh v to w
 

149
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,430
uh v to w
right uh so i'm like standing at a point

150
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
right uh so i'm like standing at a point
 

151
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,030
right uh so i'm like standing at a point
on a graph and now i like you know make

152
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
on a graph and now i like you know make
 

153
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,990
on a graph and now i like you know make
a loud noise

154
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
a loud noise
 

155
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,990
a loud noise
and the last person to hear me uh the

156
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
and the last person to hear me uh the
 

157
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,270
and the last person to hear me uh the
distance to him would be

158
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
distance to him would be
 

159
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,630
distance to him would be
uh the the eccentricity of that vertex

160
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
uh the the eccentricity of that vertex
 

161
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,830
uh the the eccentricity of that vertex
and so uh this is some kind of notion of

162
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
and so uh this is some kind of notion of
 

163
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,830
and so uh this is some kind of notion of
like radius or diameter

164
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
like radius or diameter
 

165
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,390
like radius or diameter
but sort of planted at a point and then

166
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
but sort of planted at a point and then
 

167
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,910
but sort of planted at a point and then
if we want to learn a property not of a

168
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
if we want to learn a property not of a
 

169
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,070
if we want to learn a property not of a
vertex but of the entire graph

170
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
vertex but of the entire graph
 

171
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,830
vertex but of the entire graph
one thing we can do is to find the

172
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
one thing we can do is to find the
 

173
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,430
one thing we can do is to find the
radius

174
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440

 

175
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,190

and that is given by r of g

176
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
and that is given by r of g
 

177
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,550
and that is given by r of g
is uh the min

178
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
is uh the min
 

179
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,670
is uh the min
over all of the different vertices u

180
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
over all of the different vertices u
 

181
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,509
over all of the different vertices u
of the eccentricity of u

182
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
of the eccentricity of u
 

183
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,789
of the eccentricity of u
okay so i think this is one of these

184
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
okay so i think this is one of these
 

185
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,390
okay so i think this is one of these
definitions that's really annoying to

186
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
definitions that's really annoying to
 

187
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,830
definitions that's really annoying to
parse and think about so we should like

188
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
parse and think about so we should like
 

189
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,990
parse and think about so we should like
draw a little bit of a schematic and see

190
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
draw a little bit of a schematic and see
 

191
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,149
draw a little bit of a schematic and see
what's what's going on here because uh

00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
what's what's going on here because uh
 

193
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,830
what's what's going on here because uh
especially as a geometry professor this

194
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
especially as a geometry professor this

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,190
especially as a geometry professor this
one's kind of nice because it translates

196
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
one's kind of nice because it translates
 

197
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,229
one's kind of nice because it translates
directly to

198
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
directly to
 

199
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,390
directly to
what you might do in metric geometry so

200
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
what you might do in metric geometry so
 

201
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,670
what you might do in metric geometry so
um let's say that i have a circle here

202
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
um let's say that i have a circle here
 

203
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,190
um let's say that i have a circle here
and i want the world's most complicated

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
and i want the world's most complicated
 

205
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,270
and i want the world's most complicated
way of defining its radius

206
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
way of defining its radius
 

207
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,710
way of defining its radius
okay so for any given point

208
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
okay so for any given point
 

209
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,229
okay so for any given point
there's a point in a circle that's a

210
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
there's a point in a circle that's a
 

211
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,509
there's a point in a circle that's a
circle in case you're wondering you know

212
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
circle in case you're wondering you know
 

213
00:03:59,519 --> 00:03:59,990
circle in case you're wondering you know
those are those

214
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
those are those
 

215
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,670
those are those
internet contests where like they have

216
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
internet contests where like they have
 

217
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,030
internet contests where like they have
people that just walk up to the board

218
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
people that just walk up to the board
 

219
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,830
people that just walk up to the board
and draw

220
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
and draw
 

221
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,429
and draw
perfect circles and then leave i

222
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
perfect circles and then leave i
 

223
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,910
perfect circles and then leave i
unfortunately am not an expert at this

224
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
unfortunately am not an expert at this
 

225
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,550
unfortunately am not an expert at this
matter

226
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
matter
 

227
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,509
matter
um but anyway so if we think of a point

228
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
um but anyway so if we think of a point
 

229
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,190
um but anyway so if we think of a point
like a circle as some analog of our

230
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
like a circle as some analog of our
 

231
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,990
like a circle as some analog of our
graph

232
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
graph
 

233
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,670
graph
and then i draw a point which might be

234
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
and then i draw a point which might be
 

235
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,670
and then i draw a point which might be
the analog of a vertex

236
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
the analog of a vertex
 

237
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,670
the analog of a vertex
right then what is the eccentricity well

238
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
right then what is the eccentricity well
 

239
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,069
right then what is the eccentricity well
it's the distance to the farthest away

240
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
it's the distance to the farthest away
 

241
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,030
it's the distance to the farthest away
point right so for this guy it might be

242
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040

 

243
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,110

the length of this line roughly uh

244
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
the length of this line roughly uh
 

245
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,710
the length of this line roughly uh
because that's the distance to the

246
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
because that's the distance to the
 

247
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,230
because that's the distance to the
farthest away thing

248
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
farthest away thing
 

249
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,150
farthest away thing
right so for every different point that

250
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
right so for every different point that
 

251
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,670
right so for every different point that
i draw

252
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
i draw
 

253
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,510
i draw
you know each point has its own farthest

254
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
you know each point has its own farthest
 

255
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,590
you know each point has its own farthest
away point in the circle

256
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
away point in the circle
 

257
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,030
away point in the circle
uh so there's some positive number

258
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
uh so there's some positive number
 

259
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,390
uh so there's some positive number
that's assigned to every single point in

260
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
that's assigned to every single point in
 

261
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,430
that's assigned to every single point in
this domain

262
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
this domain
 

263
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,950
this domain
and if i take the minimum of that

264
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
and if i take the minimum of that
 

265
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,710
and if i take the minimum of that
positive number

266
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
positive number
 

267
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,909
positive number
where do you think i end up

268
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919

 

269
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,670

that's right jason i end up in the

270
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
that's right jason i end up in the
 

271
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,950
that's right jason i end up in the
center of the circle

272
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
center of the circle
 

273
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,030
center of the circle
because if i think about it the distance

274
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
because if i think about it the distance
 

275
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,990
because if i think about it the distance
to the farthest away

276
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
to the farthest away
 

277
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,550
to the farthest away
point in this domain um one thing you

278
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
point in this domain um one thing you
 

279
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,070
point in this domain um one thing you
can convince yourself is that that's

280
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
can convince yourself is that that's
 

281
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,469
can convince yourself is that that's
sort of as small as possible so this is

282
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
sort of as small as possible so this is
 

283
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,150
sort of as small as possible so this is
what we might call a minimax problem

284
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
what we might call a minimax problem
 

285
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,150
what we might call a minimax problem
in in optimization because we are

286
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
in in optimization because we are
 

287
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,830
in in optimization because we are
minimizing the maximum

288
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
minimizing the maximum
 

289
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,469
minimizing the maximum
distance yeah um this also shows up in

290
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
distance yeah um this also shows up in
 

291
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,430
distance yeah um this also shows up in
game theory

292
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
game theory
 

293
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,790
game theory
all kinds of different places that solve

294
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
all kinds of different places that solve
 

295
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,150
all kinds of different places that solve
this stuff but thankfully in this

296
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
this stuff but thankfully in this
 

297
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,270
this stuff but thankfully in this
particular problem we're not going to

298
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
particular problem we're not going to
 

299
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,950
particular problem we're not going to
need all that

300
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
need all that
 

301
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,430
need all that
okay so uh right so this homework

302
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
okay so uh right so this homework
 

303
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,790
okay so uh right so this homework
problem has two parts

304
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
problem has two parts
 

305
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,870
problem has two parts
um the first is to give an algorithm for

306
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
um the first is to give an algorithm for
 

307
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,350
um the first is to give an algorithm for
computing the uh the radius of a graph

308
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
computing the uh the radius of a graph
 

309
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,550
computing the uh the radius of a graph
and then the second one is to give an

310
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
and then the second one is to give an
 

311
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,230
and then the second one is to give an
algorithm for approximating the radius

312
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
algorithm for approximating the radius
 

313
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,110
algorithm for approximating the radius
of the graph

314
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
of the graph
 

315
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,510
of the graph
uh really quickly or more quickly than

316
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
uh really quickly or more quickly than
 

317
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,629
uh really quickly or more quickly than
the first part

318
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
the first part
 

319
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,390
the first part
um i actually don't know if there's a

320
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
um i actually don't know if there's a
 

321
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,469
um i actually don't know if there's a
lower bound there but

322
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
lower bound there but
 

323
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,950
lower bound there but
come back to that later okay so in part

324
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
come back to that later okay so in part
 

325
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,230
come back to that later okay so in part
a

326
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
a
 

327
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,909
a
right we're given

328
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
right we're given
 

329
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,070
right we're given
g and moreover we're given one

330
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
g and moreover we're given one
 

331
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,590
g and moreover we're given one
additional piece of information which we

332
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
additional piece of information which we
 

333
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,230
additional piece of information which we
actually do

334
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
actually do
 

335
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,830
actually do
need in this problem i think it's one of

336
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
need in this problem i think it's one of
 

337
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,270
need in this problem i think it's one of
those words that kind of slips past us

338
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
those words that kind of slips past us
 

339
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,189
those words that kind of slips past us
when we read graph theory problems

340
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
when we read graph theory problems
 

341
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,629
when we read graph theory problems
but it's important to pay attention of

342
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
but it's important to pay attention of
 

343
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,550
but it's important to pay attention of
course and

344
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
course and
 

345
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,230
course and
that is we're given g and it's connected

346
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
that is we're given g and it's connected
 

347
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,430
that is we're given g and it's connected
i suppose really it should be given

348
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
i suppose really it should be given
 

349
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,150
i suppose really it should be given

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
g but that's okay um now what we want
 

353
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,270
g but that's okay um now what we want
is to compute

354
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280

 

355
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,670

385
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,189

um you know the the problem asks you to

386
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
um you know the the problem asks you to
 

387
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,230
um you know the the problem asks you to
compute the radius

388
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
compute the radius
 

389
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,350
compute the radius
of a graph and in some sense there's an

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
of a graph and in some sense there's an
 

391
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,430
of a graph and in some sense there's an
algorithm that just like writes itself

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
algorithm that just like writes itself
 

393
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,029

for computing the radius right because

394
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
for computing the radius right because
 

395
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,629
for computing the radius right because
the radius is the min over all the

396
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
the radius is the min over all the
 

397
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,749
the radius is the min over all the
vertices

398
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759

00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
of the eccentricity the eccentricity is
 

401
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,909
of the eccentricity the eccentricity is
the max distance so what would be the

402
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
the max distance so what would be the
 

403
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,629
the max distance so what would be the
simplest thing to do here well

404
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
simplest thing to do here well
 

405
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,830
simplest thing to do here well
in some sense it would be to loop over

406
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
in some sense it would be to loop over
 

407
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,469
in some sense it would be to loop over
all the vertices compute their distance

408
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
all the vertices compute their distance
 

409
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,510
all the vertices compute their distance
to all the other vertices

410
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
to all the other vertices
 

411
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,710
to all the other vertices
and and and and take the max for each

412
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
and and and and take the max for each
 

413
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,350
and and and and take the max for each
one of those

414
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
one of those
 

415
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,950
one of those
and then the min over all of the guys in

416
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
and then the min over all of the guys in
 

417
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,629
and then the min over all of the guys in
the outer loop

418
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
the outer loop
 

419
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,309
the outer loop
since i just said a sentence that i'm

well uh let's let's sort of write down

424
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
well uh let's let's sort of write down
 

425
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,309
well uh let's let's sort of write down
what i mean

426
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
what i mean
 

427
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,390
what i mean
um which is to say we're gonna think of

428
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
um which is to say we're gonna think of
 

429
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,990
um which is to say we're gonna think of
there being an outer

430
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
there being an outer
 

431
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,350
there being an outer
that's why we don't use this chalk an

432
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
that's why we don't use this chalk an
 

433
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,670
that's why we don't use this chalk an
outer for loop uh which is computing

434
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
outer for loop uh which is computing
 

435
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,469
outer for loop uh which is computing
this min

436
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
this min
 

437
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,309
this min
right so

438
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319

 

439
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,309

right well what are we going to do we

440
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
right well what are we going to do we
 

441
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,790
right well what are we going to do we
can you know compute

442
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800

 

443
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,350

the the shortest path distance

444
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
the the shortest path distance
 

445
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,749
the the shortest path distance
to uh all of the other w

446
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759

 

447
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,670

uh in in my graph you know

448
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
uh in in my graph you know
 

449
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,390
uh in in my graph you know
take the max

450
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400

 

451
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,790

of w of the distance from v to all the

452
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
of w of the distance from v to all the
 

453
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,790
of w of the distance from v to all the
other w's

454
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
other w's
 

455
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,150
other w's
obviously we can kind of do these two at

456
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
obviously we can kind of do these two at
 

457
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,990
obviously we can kind of do these two at
the same time

458
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
the same time
 

459
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,070
the same time
and then if this number is bigger than

460
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
and then if this number is bigger than
 

461
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,909
and then if this number is bigger than
my current max keep it and

462
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
my current max keep it and
 

463
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,869
my current max keep it and
or oh yikes if it's smaller than the

464
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
or oh yikes if it's smaller than the
 

465
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,309
or oh yikes if it's smaller than the
current estimate i have

466
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
current estimate i have
 

467
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,029
current estimate i have
of the uh the radius then i keep it and

468
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
of the uh the radius then i keep it and
 

469
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,309
of the uh the radius then i keep it and
if it's not then i throw it away right

470
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
if it's not then i throw it away right
 

471
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,230
if it's not then i throw it away right
so maybe i initialize

472
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
so maybe i initialize
 

473
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,350
so maybe i initialize
you know my radius at infinity

474
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
you know my radius at infinity
 

475
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,990
you know my radius at infinity
and now let's call this number i don't

476
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
and now let's call this number i don't
 

477
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,350
and now let's call this number i don't
know little r

478
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
know little r
 

479
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,469
know little r
if little r is less than big

480
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
if little r is less than big
 

481
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,909
if little r is less than big
r then just keep it around

482
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
r then just keep it around
 

483
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,230
r then just keep it around
right and so if we think about it i

484
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
right and so if we think about it i
 

485
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,509
right and so if we think about it i
don't think it's terribly hard to prove

486
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
don't think it's terribly hard to prove
 

487
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,110
don't think it's terribly hard to prove
that this algorithm is correct because

488
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
that this algorithm is correct because
 

489
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,230
that this algorithm is correct because
it's sort of just

490
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
it's sort of just
 

491
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,630
it's sort of just
taking our definition of what the radius

492
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
taking our definition of what the radius
 

493
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,949
taking our definition of what the radius
of a graph is and translating it into

494
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
of a graph is and translating it into
 

495
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,990
of a graph is and translating it into
um a brain dead algorithm um so i think

496
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
um a brain dead algorithm um so i think
 

497
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,790
um a brain dead algorithm um so i think
really the the challenge here uh is is

498
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
really the the challenge here uh is is
 

499
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,630
really the the challenge here uh is is
proving the the run time uh

500
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
proving the the run time uh
 

501
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,670
proving the the run time uh
in in this particular algorithm so what

502
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
in in this particular algorithm so what
 

503
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,350
in in this particular algorithm so what
does our runtime look like so we have a

504
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
does our runtime look like so we have a
 

505
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,509
does our runtime look like so we have a

549
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,310

time and somehow we've incurred an extra

550
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
time and somehow we've incurred an extra
 

551
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,230
time and somehow we've incurred an extra

00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
factor
 

553
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,470
factor
and now we have to figure out why this

554
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
and now we have to figure out why this
 

555
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,269
and now we have to figure out why this
is actually okay

556
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
is actually okay
 

557
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,630
is actually okay
or we have to fix our algorithm but in

558
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
or we have to fix our algorithm but in
 

559
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,630
or we have to fix our algorithm but in
this case uh it turns out that this

560
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
this case uh it turns out that this
 

561
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,630
this case uh it turns out that this
runtime is just inaccurate

562
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
runtime is just inaccurate
 

563
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,590
runtime is just inaccurate
okay um what's our intuition here well

564
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
okay um what's our intuition here well
 

565
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,430
okay um what's our intuition here well
i i kind of underlined it for you here

566
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
i i kind of underlined it for you here
 

567
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,750
i i kind of underlined it for you here
our graph is connected

568
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
our graph is connected
 

569
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,230
our graph is connected
in particular there's going to be a nice

570
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
in particular there's going to be a nice
 

571
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,150
in particular there's going to be a nice
property of connected grass

572
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
property of connected grass
 

573
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,150
property of connected grass
which is that the number of edges dwarfs

574
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
which is that the number of edges dwarfs
 

575
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,829
which is that the number of edges dwarfs
the number of vertices here

576
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
the number of vertices here
 

577
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,550
the number of vertices here
so really if we have v plus e you know

578
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
so really if we have v plus e you know
 

579
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,829
so really if we have v plus e you know
and sometimes it's going to look like a

580
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
and sometimes it's going to look like a
 

581
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,350
and sometimes it's going to look like a
constant factor times e

582
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
constant factor times e
 

583
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,670
constant factor times e
plus another e here so this whole thing

584
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
plus another e here so this whole thing
 

585
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,870
plus another e here so this whole thing
is going to be v times e

586
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
is going to be v times e
 

587
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,470
is going to be v times e
time yeah so let's let's make that

588
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
time yeah so let's let's make that
 

589
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,150
time yeah so let's let's make that
argument a tiny bit more uh formal here

590
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
argument a tiny bit more uh formal here
 

591
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,310
argument a tiny bit more uh formal here
so in particular we know that g

592
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
so in particular we know that g
 

593
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,790
so in particular we know that g
is connected

594
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800

 

595
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,230

um right and every vertex

596
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
um right and every vertex
 

597
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,110
um right and every vertex
so in particular what can happen here is

598
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
so in particular what can happen here is
 

599
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,710
so in particular what can happen here is
okay unless my graph consists of one

600
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
okay unless my graph consists of one
 

601
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,590
okay unless my graph consists of one
vertex

602
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
vertex
 

603
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,750
vertex
which is a case you could dispose of

604
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
which is a case you could dispose of
 

605
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,949
which is a case you could dispose of
pretty quickly

606
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
pretty quickly
 

607
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,310
pretty quickly
what i can't have is a graph that looks

608
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
what i can't have is a graph that looks
 

609
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,990
what i can't have is a graph that looks
like this like one vertex and then an

610
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
like this like one vertex and then an
 

611
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,310
like this like one vertex and then an
edge

612
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
edge
 

613
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,910
edge
floating around there everything has to

614
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
floating around there everything has to
 

615
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,670
floating around there everything has to
be connected together

616
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680

 

617
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,710

connected together okay so

618
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
connected together okay so
 

619
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,829
connected together okay so
in particular uh what this means is that

620
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839

 

621
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,069

every vertex

622
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
every vertex
 

623
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,590
every vertex
is adjacent to at least

624
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
is adjacent to at least
 

625
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,710
is adjacent to at least
one edge again

626
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
one edge again
 

627
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,069
one edge again
except i guess technically the one

628
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
except i guess technically the one
 

629
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,069
except i guess technically the one
vertex case but i think we can convince

630
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
vertex case but i think we can convince
 

631
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,670
vertex case but i think we can convince
ourselves that for any graph of constant

632
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
ourselves that for any graph of constant
 

633
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:27,990
ourselves that for any graph of constant
size

634
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
size
 

635
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,150
size
we're we're not terribly worried about

636
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
we're we're not terribly worried about
 

637
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,509
we're we're not terribly worried about
it right it's just the asymptotics that

638
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
it right it's just the asymptotics that
 

639
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,030
it right it's just the asymptotics that
matter in this problem

640
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
matter in this problem
 

641
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,269
matter in this problem
okay so if every vertex is adjacent to

642
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
okay so if every vertex is adjacent to
 

643
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,790
okay so if every vertex is adjacent to
one edge

644
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
one edge
 

645
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,470
one edge
well and remember that every edge kind

646
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
well and remember that every edge kind
 

647
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,150
well and remember that every edge kind
of by definition of an edge is adjacent

648
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
of by definition of an edge is adjacent
 

649
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,389
of by definition of an edge is adjacent
to two vertices then what we can

650
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
to two vertices then what we can
 

651
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,190
to two vertices then what we can
conclude

652
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
conclude
 

653
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,430
conclude
is that the number of vertices is less

654
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
is that the number of vertices is less
 

655
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,509
is that the number of vertices is less
than or equal to the number of edges

656
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
than or equal to the number of edges
 

657
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,110
than or equal to the number of edges
divided by two there's a conservative

658
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
divided by two there's a conservative
 

659
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,629
divided by two there's a conservative
estimate

660
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
estimate
 

661
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,430
estimate
and so in particular what does that mean

662
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
and so in particular what does that mean
 

663
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,710
and so in particular what does that mean
it means

664
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
it means
 

665
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,150
it means
that v is big o of

666
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
that v is big o of
 

667
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,310
that v is big o of
e this is a case where we have to be

668
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
e this is a case where we have to be
 

669
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,230
e this is a case where we have to be
quite careful about big o being an upper

670
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
quite careful about big o being an upper
 

671
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,350
quite careful about big o being an upper
bound

672
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
bound
 

673
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,910
bound
right uh in this case typically v is

674
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
right uh in this case typically v is
 

675
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,790
right uh in this case typically v is
much less than e

676
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
much less than e
 

677
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,509
much less than e
um well depends how many edges like if

678
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
um well depends how many edges like if
 

679
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,069
um well depends how many edges like if
you have a really dense graph or not

680
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
you have a really dense graph or not
 

681
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,069
you have a really dense graph or not
um but in this case what does that mean

682
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
um but in this case what does that mean
 

683
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,310
um but in this case what does that mean
that means that

684
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
that means that
 

685
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,230
that means that
mod v plus mod e is really just

686
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
mod v plus mod e is really just
 

687
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,430
mod v plus mod e is really just
big o of mod e right because this is big

688
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
big o of mod e right because this is big
 

689
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,069
big o of mod e right because this is big
o mari

690
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
o mari
 

691
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,829
o mari
plus big o of e and that means

692
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
plus big o of e and that means
 

693
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,629
plus big o of e and that means
that our problem really runs in v

694
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
that our problem really runs in v
 

695
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,550
that our problem really runs in v
times e time uh which is what we wanted

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
times e time uh which is what we wanted
 

697
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,629

are there any questions from our
audience on part part a here

703
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,590

cool yes understand why uh

704
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
cool yes understand why uh
 

705
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,350
cool yes understand why uh
where you went from the first statement

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
where you went from the first statement
 

707
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,110
where you went from the first statement

00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
e oh yeah so i guess i guess there's
 

715
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,230
e oh yeah so i guess i guess there's
sort of two things that matter here

716
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
sort of two things that matter here
 

717
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,629
sort of two things that matter here
right

718
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
right
 

719
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,910
right
uh every vertex is adjacent to one edge

720
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
uh every vertex is adjacent to one edge
 

721
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,590
uh every vertex is adjacent to one edge
at most and every edge uh

722
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
at most and every edge uh

to two vertices
 

727
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,990
to two vertices
um i guess actually it's the second one

728
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
um i guess actually it's the second one
 

729
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,069
um i guess actually it's the second one
that matters so you you can never have a

730
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
that matters so you you can never have a
 

731
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,230
that matters so you you can never have a
vertex just floating by itself so one

way that i can count

734
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
way that i can count
 

735
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,269
way that i can count
my number of vertices by looking at the

736
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
my number of vertices by looking at the
 

737
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,230
my number of vertices by looking at the
number of edges and saying that well

738
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
number of edges and saying that well
 

739
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,069
number of edges and saying that well
every edge can touch exactly two

740

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,829
every edge can touch exactly two
vertices every vertex has to touch

742
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
vertices every vertex has to touch
 

743
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,030
vertices every vertex has to touch
exactly

00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
exactly
 

745
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,269
exactly
well at least one edge um so if you put

746
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
well at least one edge um so if you put
 

747
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,710
well at least one edge um so if you put
those together you can convince yourself

748
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
those together you can convince yourself
 

749
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,710
those together you can convince yourself
that this bound has to be true

750
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
that this bound has to be true
 

751
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,910
that this bound has to be true
if you want to be conservative about it

752
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
if you want to be conservative about it
 

753
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,910
if you want to be conservative about it
you can just get rid of the divided by

754
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
you can just get rid of the divided by
 

755
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,949
you can just get rid of the divided by
two here i guess it doesn't really

756
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
two here i guess it doesn't really
 

757
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,430
two here i guess it doesn't really
matter

758
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440

 

759
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,230

any other questions from our audience

760
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
any other questions from our audience
 

761
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,230
any other questions from our audience
all right so now uh let's take a look at

762
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
all right so now uh let's take a look at
 

763
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,990
all right so now uh let's take a look at
part b

764
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
part b
 

765
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,189
part b
uh so in in in part b here uh they ask

766
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
uh so in in in part b here uh they ask
 

767
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,790
uh so in in in part b here uh they ask
us to basically do the

768
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
us to basically do the
 

769
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,069
us to basically do the
some version of the same thing right

770
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
some version of the same thing right
 

771
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,069
some version of the same thing right
they want us to now approximate the

772
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
they want us to now approximate the
 

773
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,069
they want us to now approximate the
radius but we're given a smaller

774
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
radius but we're given a smaller
 

775
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,389
radius but we're given a smaller
budget of time so now what we want

776
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
budget of time so now what we want
 

777
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:14,629
budget of time so now what we want
in number b here is uh compute an r star

778
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639

 

779
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,790

such that uh i got yelled at in my

780
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
such that uh i got yelled at in my
 

781
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,670
such that uh i got yelled at in my
textbook that

782
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
textbook that
 

783
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,069

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
um like that now notice
 

807
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,629
um like that now notice
so in other words we want to the first

808
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
so in other words we want to the first
 

809
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,829
so in other words we want to the first
thing to notice is we want to upper

the radius of our graph and already this
 

815
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,990
the radius of our graph and already this
should suggest to us how we might solve

816
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
should suggest to us how we might solve
 

817
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,710
should suggest to us how we might solve
this problem

818
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
this problem
 

819
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,470
this problem
right because if we take a look back at

820
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
right because if we take a look back at
 

821
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,389
right because if we take a look back at
our definition of radius over here

822
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
our definition of radius over here
 

823
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,430
our definition of radius over here
notice that the radius is a min right so

824
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
notice that the radius is a min right so
 

825
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,550
notice that the radius is a min right so
what's going to happen

826
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
what's going to happen
 

827
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,949
what's going to happen
if i returned epsilon of some other

828
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
if i returned epsilon of some other
 

829
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,230
if i returned epsilon of some other

vertex
 

831
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,310
vertex
well it's lower bounded by the radius

832
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
well it's lower bounded by the radius
 

833
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,750
well it's lower bounded by the radius
because the radius is the smallest

834
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
because the radius is the smallest
 

835
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,150
because the radius is the smallest
possible epsilon over any vertex

836
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
possible epsilon over any vertex
 

837
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,949
possible epsilon over any vertex
that makes sense now when i was doing

838
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
that makes sense now when i was doing
 

839
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,750
that makes sense now when i was doing
this problem

840
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
this problem
 

841
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,230
this problem
um because uh you know i'm the dumb

842
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
um because uh you know i'm the dumb
 

843
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,150

instructor of the three i said well okay
but

846
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
but
 

847
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,990
but
like you know maybe i need to be like

848
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
like you know maybe i need to be like
 

849
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,030
like you know maybe i need to be like
somehow judicious about what vertex i

850
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
somehow judicious about what vertex i
 

851
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,150
somehow judicious about what vertex i
choose like

852
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
choose like
 

853
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,069
choose like
you know well in some sense what this

854
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
you know well in some sense what this
 

855
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,430
you know well in some sense what this
suggests is that maybe i choose some

856
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
suggests is that maybe i choose some
 

857
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,829
suggests is that maybe i choose some
other vertex and compute its its

858
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
other vertex and compute its its
 

859
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,030
other vertex and compute its its
radius and return that as our

860
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
radius and return that as our
 

861
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,670
radius and return that as our
approximation but of course the problem

862
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
approximation but of course the problem
 

863
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,269
approximation but of course the problem
wants me to sandwich it

864
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
wants me to sandwich it
 

865
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,430
wants me to sandwich it
between two values here so in addition

866
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
between two values here so in addition
 

867
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,550
between two values here so in addition
to

868
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
to
 

869
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,629
to
uh you know upper bounding r i want to

870
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
uh you know upper bounding r i want to
 

871
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,069
uh you know upper bounding r i want to
be less than two terms are in other

872
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
be less than two terms are in other
 

873
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,430
be less than two terms are in other
words my approximation is within a

874
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
words my approximation is within a
 

875
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,110
words my approximation is within a
constant factor

876
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
constant factor
 

877
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,030
constant factor
um i tried some some weird stuff like

878
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
um i tried some some weird stuff like
 

879
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,629
um i tried some some weird stuff like
farthest point sampling and so on then i

880
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
farthest point sampling and so on then i
 

881
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,269
farthest point sampling and so on then i
realized that

882
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
realized that
 

883
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,670
realized that
you actually don't really need to do any

884
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
you actually don't really need to do any
 

885
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,310
you actually don't really need to do any
of that

886
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
of that
 

887
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,030
of that
one thing you can do is literally choose

888
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
one thing you can do is literally choose
 

889
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,629
one thing you can do is literally choose
any vertex

890
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
any vertex
 

891
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,310
any vertex
return its uh eccentricity and that's

892
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
return its uh eccentricity and that's
 

893
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,790
return its uh eccentricity and that's
actually good enough yeah so here's our

894
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
actually good enough yeah so here's our
 

895
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,990
actually good enough yeah so here's our
algorithm

896
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
algorithm
 

897
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,790
algorithm
um great let me go back to my notes here

898
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
um great let me go back to my notes here
 

899
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,990
um great let me go back to my notes here
i don't know why i'm following my notes

900
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
i don't know why i'm following my notes
 

901
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,430
i don't know why i'm following my notes
actually through the soft top head but

902
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
actually through the soft top head but
 

903
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,790
actually through the soft top head but
they make me feel better

904
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
they make me feel better
 

905
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,350
they make me feel better
if i'm looking at them at the same time

906
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
if i'm looking at them at the same time
 

907
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,430
if i'm looking at them at the same time
so in particular

908
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
so in particular
 

909
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,829
so in particular
what i'm going to do is choose

910
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839

 

911
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,470

a u and v let me be clear here any

912
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
a u and v let me be clear here any
 

913
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,150
a u and v let me be clear here any
u and v so if i'm using some data

914
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
u and v so if i'm using some data
 

915
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,310
u and v so if i'm using some data
structure to store all my vertices i

916
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
structure to store all my vertices i
 

917
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,269
structure to store all my vertices i
just take the first one

918
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
just take the first one
 

919
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,949
just take the first one
whatever and two

920
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
whatever and two
 

921
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:49,430
whatever and two
i'm going to return

922
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440

 

923
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,949

r star is equal to epsilon of u

924
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
r star is equal to epsilon of u
 

925
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,470
r star is equal to epsilon of u
um now of course this isn't really an

926
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
um now of course this isn't really an
 

927
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,430
um now of course this isn't really an
algorithm if you do this on your

928
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
algorithm if you do this on your
 

929
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,710
algorithm if you do this on your
homework you'll lose points

930
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
homework you'll lose points
 

931
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,069
homework you'll lose points
and the reason is that i haven't told

932
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
and the reason is that i haven't told
 

933
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,550
and the reason is that i haven't told
you how to compute this value here

934
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
you how to compute this value here
 

935
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,990
you how to compute this value here
so if you were to write out your answer

936
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
so if you were to write out your answer
 

937
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,430
so if you were to write out your answer
for this problem of course you should

938
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
for this problem of course you should
 

939
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,390
for this problem of course you should
tell us

940
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
tell us
 

941
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,789
tell us
that like really to compute epsilon what

942
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
that like really to compute epsilon what
 

943
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,710
that like really to compute epsilon what
do i do i use breadth first search to

944
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
do i do i use breadth first search to
 

945
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,390
do i do i use breadth first search to
compute the shortest path from u to all

946
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
compute the shortest path from u to all
 

947
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,590
compute the shortest path from u to all
the other vertices

948
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
the other vertices
 

949
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,189
the other vertices
and then i guess i take the the max

950
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
and then i guess i take the the max
 

951
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,429
and then i guess i take the the max
value here okay so i think you guys can

952
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
value here okay so i think you guys can
 

953
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,470
value here okay so i think you guys can
fill in the uh

954
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
fill in the uh
 

955
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,110
fill in the uh
the details of the algorithm uh the

956
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
the details of the algorithm uh the
 

957
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,949
the details of the algorithm uh the
bigger challenge is going to be to prove

958
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
bigger challenge is going to be to prove
 

959
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,350
bigger challenge is going to be to prove
that this is actually a good bound

960
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
that this is actually a good bound
 

961
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,669
that this is actually a good bound
right uh and so in other words what we

962
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
right uh and so in other words what we
 

963
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,789
right uh and so in other words what we
need to

964
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
need to
 

965
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,350
need to
prove here i don't know like there's a

966
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
prove here i don't know like there's a
 

967
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,830
prove here i don't know like there's a
claim

968
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
claim
 

969
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,510
claim
there's a proposition there's a theorem

970
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
there's a proposition there's a theorem
 

971
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,270
there's a proposition there's a theorem
so we're like somewhere on that axis

972
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
so we're like somewhere on that axis
 

973
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,549
so we're like somewhere on that axis
i'm going to call this one a claim i'm

974
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
i'm going to call this one a claim i'm
 

975
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,590
i'm going to call this one a claim i'm
going to downgrade it

976
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600

 

977
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,789

and that is that the radius of my graph

978
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
and that is that the radius of my graph
 

979
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,710
and that is that the radius of my graph
is less than or equal to r star

980
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
is less than or equal to r star
 

981
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,510
is less than or equal to r star
which is less than or equal to two times

982
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
which is less than or equal to two times
 

983
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,110
which is less than or equal to two times
the radius of my graph

984
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120

 

985
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,230

okay so let's uh let's prove this uh

986
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
okay so let's uh let's prove this uh
 

987
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,870
okay so let's uh let's prove this uh
this thing managing to use all of my

988
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
this thing managing to use all of my
 

989
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,230
this thing managing to use all of my
boards on one problem here

990
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240

 

991
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,270

okay so uh in particular to prove this

992
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
okay so uh in particular to prove this
 

993
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,950
okay so uh in particular to prove this
claim i need to prove two inequalities

994
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
claim i need to prove two inequalities
 

995
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,390
claim i need to prove two inequalities
this is like two homework problems in

996
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
this is like two homework problems in
 

997
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,110
this is like two homework problems in
one

998
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
one
 

999
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,990
one
uh so let's number those off there's one

1000
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
uh so let's number those off there's one
 

1001
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,710
uh so let's number those off there's one
there's two okay

1002
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
there's two okay
 

1003
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,270
there's two okay
so let's do inequality one i think we

1004
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
so let's do inequality one i think we
 

1005
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,029
so let's do inequality one i think we
can squeeze

1006
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
can squeeze
 

1007
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,830
can squeeze
him into a relatively small space so

1008
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
him into a relatively small space so
 

1009
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,549
him into a relatively small space so
remember

1010
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
remember
 

1011
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,750
remember
uh what is the radius of my graph

1012
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
uh what is the radius of my graph
 

1013
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,789
uh what is the radius of my graph
well just by definition right we know

1014
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
well just by definition right we know
 

1015
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,110
well just by definition right we know
that it's the min

1016
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
that it's the min
 

1017
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,190
that it's the min
over all possible u of epsilon of u

1018
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200

 

1019
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,350

so in particular what's the nice

1020
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
so in particular what's the nice
 

1021
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,870
so in particular what's the nice
property about the minimum of something

1022
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
property about the minimum of something
 

1023
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,549
property about the minimum of something
is that it's less than everything else

1024
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
is that it's less than everything else
 

1025
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,150
is that it's less than everything else
or equal so this

1026
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
or equal so this
 

1027
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,310
or equal so this
maybe let's call this u naught just to

1028
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
maybe let's call this u naught just to
 

1029
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,750
maybe let's call this u naught just to
distinguish between that and

1030
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
distinguish between that and
 

1031
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,110
distinguish between that and
the notation i have on the left hand

1032
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
the notation i have on the left hand
 

1033
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,990
the notation i have on the left hand
side this is less than or equal to

1034
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
side this is less than or equal to
 

1035
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,190
side this is less than or equal to
epsilon of u because

1036
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
epsilon of u because
 

1037
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,710
epsilon of u because
i don't know because min yeah uh

1038
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
i don't know because min yeah uh
 

1039
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,669
i don't know because min yeah uh
so uh that actually already uh and of

1040
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
so uh that actually already uh and of
 

1041
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,190
so uh that actually already uh and of
course this is exactly what we chose to

1042
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
course this is exactly what we chose to
 

1043
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,710
course this is exactly what we chose to
be our star

1044
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
be our star
 

1045
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,590
be our star
so our first part of our proof is done

1046
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
so our first part of our proof is done
 

1047
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:11,909
so our first part of our proof is done
here

1048
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
here
 

1049
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,630

yep so this is the easy part and

1050
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
yep so this is the easy part and
 

1051
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,590
yep so this is the easy part and
sometimes like

1052

this is sort of what inspired our

1054
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
this is sort of what inspired our
 

1055
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,710
this is sort of what inspired our
algorithm so we expect this bound to be

1056
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
algorithm so we expect this bound to be
 

1057
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,870
algorithm so we expect this bound to be
kind of straightforward

1058
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
kind of straightforward
 

1059
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,510
kind of straightforward
okay but the other half of the problem

1060
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
okay but the other half of the problem
 

1061
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,990
okay but the other half of the problem
is a little more

1062
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
is a little more
 

1063
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,029
is a little more
tricky uh and actually

1064
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
tricky uh and actually
 

1065
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,470
tricky uh and actually
there's a solution in the notes and then

1066
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,480
there's a solution in the notes and then
 

1067
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,909
there's a solution in the notes and then
i decided just to make it a little more

1068
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
i decided just to make it a little more
 

1069
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,669
i decided just to make it a little more
inaccurate to write up my own

1071
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,789
inaccurate to write up my own
um so uh but actually i have

00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
um so uh but actually i have

tend to use a tiny piece of notation

1078
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
tend to use a tiny piece of notation
 

1079
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,909
tend to use a tiny piece of notation
that i like so for my convenience and

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,909
future problem sessions i thought i'd
introduce it now

1084
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
introduce it now
 

1085
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,950
introduce it now
so we're solving a minimization problem

1086
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
so we're solving a minimization problem
 

1087
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,549
so we're solving a minimization problem
the nice thing is that in this class

1088
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
the nice thing is that in this class
 

1089
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,390
the nice thing is that in this class
everything we do is finite

1090
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
everything we do is finite
 

1091
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,750
everything we do is finite
if you take my graduate course that's

1092
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
if you take my graduate course that's
 

1093
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,110
if you take my graduate course that's
not going to be the case in fact

not going to be the case in fact
actually in lecture two we're going to

1096
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
actually in lecture two we're going to
 

1097
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,150
actually in lecture two we're going to
do like variational calculus but

1098
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
do like variational calculus but
 

1099
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,789
do like variational calculus but
uh in in this course uh what does that

1100
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
uh in in this course uh what does that
 

1101
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,510
uh in in this course uh what does that
mean that means if i minimize a function

1102
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
mean that means if i minimize a function
 

1103
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,750
mean that means if i minimize a function
there's actually a vertex in my graph

1104
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
there's actually a vertex in my graph
 

1105
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,630
there's actually a vertex in my graph
that achieves that minimum

1106
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
that achieves that minimum
 

1107
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,070
that achieves that minimum
right this is different than like for

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
right this is different than like for
 

1109
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,990
right this is different than like for
example if i then i'll shut up but like

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
example if i then i'll shut up but like
 

1111
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,510

if i wanted to minimize
you know here's f of x equals

1114
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
you know here's f of x equals
 

1115
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,870
you know here's f of x equals
1 over x and i ask you for the minimum

1116
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
1 over x and i ask you for the minimum
 

1117
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,470
1 over x and i ask you for the minimum
value well it's

1118
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
value well it's
 

1119
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,470
value well it's
you know overall x greater than or equal

1120
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
you know overall x greater than or equal
 

1121
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,669
you know overall x greater than or equal
to zero

1122
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
to zero
 

1123
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,430
to zero
well the minimum value is zero right if

1124
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
well the minimum value is zero right if
 

1125
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,110
well the minimum value is zero right if
i take x off to infinity

1126
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
i take x off to infinity
 

1127
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,029
i take x off to infinity
but it never quite crosses zero right so

1128
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
but it never quite crosses zero right so
 

1129
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,310
but it never quite crosses zero right so
you're kind of in this weird

1130
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
you're kind of in this weird
 

1131
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,390
you're kind of in this weird
universe if you remember jason's lecture

1132
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
universe if you remember jason's lecture
 

1133
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,909
universe if you remember jason's lecture
he talked about imps and supes as

1134
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
he talked about imps and supes as
 

1135
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,669
he talked about imps and supes as
opposed to min's and max's

1136
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
opposed to min's and max's
 

1137
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,630
opposed to min's and max's
but this can't happen in our problem

1138
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
but this can't happen in our problem
 

1139
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,149
but this can't happen in our problem
because when we compute a min there's

1140
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
because when we compute a min there's
 

1141
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,310
because when we compute a min there's
actually a vertex that achieves it

1142
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
actually a vertex that achieves it
 

1143
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,750
actually a vertex that achieves it
and that vertex we call argument okay

1144
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
and that vertex we call argument okay
 

1145
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,750
and that vertex we call argument okay
and so this arg here stands for for

1146
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
and so this arg here stands for for
 

1147
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,789
and so this arg here stands for for
argument

1148
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:48,799
argument
 

1149
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,270
argument
so one thing that i can do is say okay

1150
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
so one thing that i can do is say okay
 

1151
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,990
so one thing that i can do is say okay
so

1152
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
so
 

1153
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,549
so
remember that my radius is the min

1154
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:58,559

 

1155
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,230

of u and this is just fancy notation for
 

1167
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,310
of u and this is just fancy notation for
saying give me the actual vertex

1168

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,510
uh the nice thing about this problem is
that we're not worried

1176
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
that we're not worried
 

1177
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,750
that we're not worried
yet about i will make runtime so i can

1178
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
yet about i will make runtime so i can
 

1179
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,870
yet about i will make runtime so i can
construct this kind of thing and not

1180
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880
construct this kind of thing and not
 

1181
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,990
construct this kind of thing and not
worry about how i actually found

1182
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
worry about how i actually found
 

1183
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,669
worry about how i actually found
it right okay so let's say that we did

1184
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
it right okay so let's say that we did
 

1185
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,710
it right okay so let's say that we did
that so this is

1186
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
that so this is
 

1187
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,909
that so this is
find me the vertex um that actually

1188
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
find me the vertex um that actually
 

1189
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,630
find me the vertex um that actually
gives me

1190
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
gives me
 

1191
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,630
gives me
the radius right so in other words i

1192
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
the radius right so in other words i
 

1193
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,789
the radius right so in other words i
find that vertex and then i find his

1194
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
find that vertex and then i find his
 

1195
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,350
find that vertex and then i find his
or her farthest away vertex and measure

1196
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
or her farthest away vertex and measure
 

1197
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,110
or her farthest away vertex and measure
the distance and that distance is the

1198
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
the distance and that distance is the
 

1199
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,549
the distance and that distance is the
radius of my graph

1200
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
radius of my graph
 

1201
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,669
radius of my graph
okay um so let's actually do that so in

1202
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
okay um so let's actually do that so in
 

1203
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,870
okay um so let's actually do that so in
particular

1204
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
particular
 

1205
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,710
particular
then i can define a second vertex v

1206
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
then i can define a second vertex v
 

1207
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,710
then i can define a second vertex v
naught

1208
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
naught
 

1209
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,029
naught
well how does the radius algorithm work

1210
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
well how does the radius algorithm work
 

1211
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,549
well how does the radius algorithm work
i find the central guy and then i find

1212
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
i find the central guy and then i find
 

1213
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,310
i find the central guy and then i find
the one that's farthest away

1214
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
the one that's farthest away
 

1215
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,549
the one that's farthest away
so we're going to make him the arg max

1216
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
so we're going to make him the arg max
 

1217
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,710
so we're going to make him the arg max
over all v in my graph of the distance

1218
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
over all v in my graph of the distance
 

1219
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,390
over all v in my graph of the distance
starting at u to any v

1220
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
starting at u to any v
 

1221
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,350
starting at u to any v
right so if i think about my circle it's

1222
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
right so if i think about my circle it's
 

1223
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,470
right so if i think about my circle it's
a circle

1224
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
a circle
 

1225
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,110
a circle
right then u naught is like that center

1226
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
right then u naught is like that center
 

1227
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,549
right then u naught is like that center
of my circle

1228
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
of my circle
 

1229
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,230
of my circle
and then v naught is like that far away

1230
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,240
and then v naught is like that far away
 

1231
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,350
and then v naught is like that far away
point

1232
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
point
 

1233
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,029
point
this is a schematic right my circle is

1234
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
this is a schematic right my circle is
 

1235
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,310
this is a schematic right my circle is
really a graph in this problem but i

1236
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
really a graph in this problem but i
 

1237
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,630
really a graph in this problem but i
think i think the analogy actually works

1238
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
think i think the analogy actually works
 

1239
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,510
think i think the analogy actually works
okay but in reality my algorithm was

1240
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
okay but in reality my algorithm was
 

1241
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,029
okay but in reality my algorithm was
brain dead i didn't actually compute u

1242
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
brain dead i didn't actually compute u
 

1243
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:37,990
brain dead i didn't actually compute u
naught i computed

1244
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
naught i computed
 

1245
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,909
naught i computed
i just randomly drew sorry i shouldn't

1246
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
i just randomly drew sorry i shouldn't
 

1247
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,149
i just randomly drew sorry i shouldn't
use that word i arbitrarily drew a

1248
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:42,159
use that word i arbitrarily drew a
 

1249
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,350
use that word i arbitrarily drew a
vertex u

1250
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
vertex u
 

1251
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,270
vertex u
and then computed you know the farthest

1252
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
and then computed you know the farthest
 

1253
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,950
and then computed you know the farthest
away distance from that guy

1254
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
away distance from that guy
 

1255
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,710
away distance from that guy
uh and of course what we have to check

1256
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
uh and of course what we have to check
 

1257
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,230
uh and of course what we have to check
is that that thing is within a factor of

1258
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
is that that thing is within a factor of
 

1259
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,830
is that that thing is within a factor of
two of what i wanted

1260
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
two of what i wanted
 

1261
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,470
two of what i wanted
so okay uh if i have u then i'm

1262
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
so okay uh if i have u then i'm
 

1263
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,149
so okay uh if i have u then i'm
additionally gonna define one more thing

1264
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
additionally gonna define one more thing
 

1265
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,070
additionally gonna define one more thing
called v

1266
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
called v
 

1267
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,310
called v
and that

1268
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,320

 

1269
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,750

uh mm-hmm

1270
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
uh mm-hmm
 

1271
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,310
uh mm-hmm
oh boy uh okay so i'm noticing i'm

1272
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
oh boy uh okay so i'm noticing i'm
 

1273
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,149
oh boy uh okay so i'm noticing i'm
saying one thing and i'm writing another

1274
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
saying one thing and i'm writing another
 

1275
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,630
saying one thing and i'm writing another
u naught is the center of my graph i

1276
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
u naught is the center of my graph i
 

1277
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,149
u naught is the center of my graph i
just i think i said it i just forgot to

1278
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
just i think i said it i just forgot to
 

1279
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:18,710
just i think i said it i just forgot to
write it

1280
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
write it
 

1281
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,789
write it
and then this v is the farthest away guy

1282
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
and then this v is the farthest away guy
 

1283
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,070
and then this v is the farthest away guy
from him so basically

1284
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
from him so basically
 

1285
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,310
from him so basically
the subscript zero here means like is

1286
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
the subscript zero here means like is
 

1287
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,070
the subscript zero here means like is
the platonic ideal of what i wanted in

1288
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
the platonic ideal of what i wanted in
 

1289
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,830
the platonic ideal of what i wanted in
my problem and no subscript is gonna

1290
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
my problem and no subscript is gonna
 

1291
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,390
my problem and no subscript is gonna
mean

1292
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
mean
 

1293
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,590
mean
the other one so now um

1294
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
the other one so now um
 

1295
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,110
the other one so now um
i compute the farthest away thing from

1296
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
i compute the farthest away thing from
 

1297
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,549
i compute the farthest away thing from
the u that i actually chose in my

that's some v bar right so again
 

1303
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,710
that's some v bar right so again
remember my algorithm just says

1304
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
remember my algorithm just says
 

1305
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,710
remember my algorithm just says
okay i'm going to like choose some other

1306
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
okay i'm going to like choose some other

so why did i introduce all of this

1326
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
so why did i introduce all of this
 

1327
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,750
so why did i introduce all of this
notation

1328

notation
 

1329
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,110

1340
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
thing v naught in reality i
 

1341
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,430
thing v naught in reality i
arbitrarily chose a point u and i

1342
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
arbitrarily chose a point u and i
 

1343
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,510
arbitrarily chose a point u and i
returned uh u's distance

1344
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
returned uh u's distance
 

1345
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,110
returned uh u's distance
to some point v and i want to show that

1346
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120
to some point v and i want to show that
 

1347
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,549
to some point v and i want to show that
those two things are within a factor of

1348
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
those two things are within a factor of
 

1349
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,830
those two things are within a factor of
two of each other

1350
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:19,840
two of each other
 

1351
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,590
two of each other
okay that summary makes sense even if i

1352
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
okay that summary makes sense even if i
 

1353
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,350
okay that summary makes sense even if i
talked in circles for a little while

1354
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
talked in circles for a little while
 

1355
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,070
talked in circles for a little while
okay so let's actually do that so

1356
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
okay so let's actually do that so
 

1357
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,350
okay so let's actually do that so
remember that

1358
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
remember that
 

1359
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,789
remember that
uh the thing that i'm going to actually

1360
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
uh the thing that i'm going to actually
 

1361
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,390
uh the thing that i'm going to actually
return is r star

1362
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400
return is r star
 

1363
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,310
return is r star
and that is equal to the distance from u

1364
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,320
and that is equal to the distance from u
 

1365
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,789
and that is equal to the distance from u
to v

1366
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
to v
 

1367
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,070
to v
now because i just made all these

1368
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
now because i just made all these
 

1369
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,870
now because i just made all these
definitions and now i get to

1370
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
definitions and now i get to
 

1371
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,269
definitions and now i get to
uh use my favorite inequality

1372
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
uh use my favorite inequality
 

1373
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,710
uh use my favorite inequality
um in fact this is sort of the only

1374
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
um in fact this is sort of the only
 

1375
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,470
um in fact this is sort of the only
inequality we know in this class so far

1376
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
inequality we know in this class so far
 

1377
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,269
inequality we know in this class so far
i think

1378
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
i think
 

1379
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,430
i think
which is the triangle inequality uh

1380
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
which is the triangle inequality uh
 

1381
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,470
which is the triangle inequality uh
which says

1382
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
which says
 

1383
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,950
which says
that of course this is less than or

1384
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
that of course this is less than or
 

1385
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,070
that of course this is less than or
equal to

1386
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
equal to
 

1387
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,830
equal to
the distance from u to u naught

1388
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
the distance from u to u naught
 

1389
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,870
the distance from u to u naught
plus the distance from u not

1390
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
plus the distance from u not
 

1391
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,269
plus the distance from u not
to v right so in other words this is

1392
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
to v right so in other words this is
 

1393
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,630
to v right so in other words this is
saying the shortest path from u

1394
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640
saying the shortest path from u
 

1395
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,269
saying the shortest path from u
to v is always upper bounded from the

1396
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
to v is always upper bounded from the
 

1397
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,630
to v is always upper bounded from the
length of the shortest path

1398
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
length of the shortest path
 

1399
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,549
length of the shortest path
from u to u naught and then u naught to

1400
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
from u to u naught and then u naught to
 

1401
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,430
from u to u naught and then u naught to
v right this is drawing a triangle

1402
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440
v right this is drawing a triangle
 

1403
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,070
v right this is drawing a triangle
aha but take a look what is

1404
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,080
aha but take a look what is
 

1405
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,870
aha but take a look what is
the actual radius of my graph well in my

1406
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
the actual radius of my graph well in my
 

1407
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,990
the actual radius of my graph well in my
notation

1408
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
notation
 

1409
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,990
notation
the radius of my graph is exactly the

1410
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
the radius of my graph is exactly the
 

1411
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,190
the radius of my graph is exactly the
distance

1412
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200
distance
 

1413
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,470
distance
from u naught to v

1414
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
from u naught to v
 

1415
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,549
from u naught to v
naught and this thing

1416
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
naught and this thing
 

1417
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,710
naught and this thing
is bigger than the distance from u

1418
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
is bigger than the distance from u
 

1419
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,870
is bigger than the distance from u
naught to anything else by definition

1420
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880

 

1421
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,310

for all of e right so if i flip this

1422
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
for all of e right so if i flip this
 

1423
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,230
for all of e right so if i flip this
inequality backward

1424
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
inequality backward
 

1425
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,830
inequality backward
well take a look this is the distance

1426
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
well take a look this is the distance
 

1427
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,510
well take a look this is the distance
from u naught to something this is the

1428
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,520
from u naught to something this is the
 

1429
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,110
from u naught to something this is the
distance from u naught to something

1430
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,120
distance from u naught to something
 

1431
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,149
distance from u naught to something
so i incur two factors of the radius

1432
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
so i incur two factors of the radius
 

1433
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,789
so i incur two factors of the radius
and i get the bound that i wanted yep uh

1434
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
and i get the bound that i wanted yep uh
 

1435
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,950
and i get the bound that i wanted yep uh
and so this is a slightly more formal

1436
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
and so this is a slightly more formal
 

1437
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,830
and so this is a slightly more formal
proof of

1438
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
proof of
 

1439
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,870
proof of
exactly the same thing that's in the

1440
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:02,880
exactly the same thing that's in the
 

1441
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,029
exactly the same thing that's in the
homework notes okay so the one thing

1442
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
homework notes okay so the one thing
 

1443
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,310
homework notes okay so the one thing
that's remaining is to actually show

1444
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
that's remaining is to actually show
 

1445
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,830
that's remaining is to actually show
that our algorithm

1446
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
that our algorithm
 

1447
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,590
that our algorithm
runs in a reasonable amount of time so i

1448
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
runs in a reasonable amount of time so i
 

1449
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,789
runs in a reasonable amount of time so i
think they give us a budget of order e

1450
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
think they give us a budget of order e
 

1451
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,190
think they give us a budget of order e
time but notice that argument is

1452
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200
time but notice that argument is
 

1453
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,789
time but notice that argument is
precisely the argument that we

1454
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
precisely the argument that we
 

1455
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,430
precisely the argument that we
just made right here uh just minus the v

1456
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
just made right here uh just minus the v
 

1457
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,710
just made right here uh just minus the v
factor

1458
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:20,720
factor
 

1459
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,630
factor
and the v factor just came from looping

1460
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
and the v factor just came from looping
 

1461
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,029
and the v factor just came from looping
over all the vertices in in part a

1462
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
over all the vertices in in part a
 

1463
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,350
over all the vertices in in part a
uh so now i think we're we're done with

1464
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
uh so now i think we're we're done with
 

1465
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,950
uh so now i think we're we're done with
problem one

1466
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
problem one
 

1467
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,390
problem one
as usual i've wasted too much time on

00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,400
as usual i've wasted too much time on
 

1469
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,470
as usual i've wasted too much time on
the easy problem all right any questions

the easy problem all right any questions
about uh about this one

1472
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
about uh about this one
 

1473
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,710
about uh about this one
excellent well now that i've written too

1474
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:36,720
excellent well now that i've written too
 

1475
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,669
excellent well now that i've written too
much uh let's uh do the rest of it

1476
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
much uh let's uh do the rest of it
 

1477
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,110
much uh let's uh do the rest of it
i spent time on this problem because i

1478
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
i spent time on this problem because i
 

1479
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,350
i spent time on this problem because i
like it it looks like a geometry problem

1480
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
like it it looks like a geometry problem
 

1481
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,870
like it it looks like a geometry problem
okay so now

1482
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
okay so now
 

1483
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,510
okay so now
uh let's see in problem two which i

1484
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
uh let's see in problem two which i
 

1485
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,950
uh let's see in problem two which i
noticed that this homework is kind of

1486
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960

homework before doing

1506
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
homework before doing
 

1507
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,190
homework before doing
uh the current one i think the ordering

1508
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
uh the current one i think the ordering
 

1509
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,950
uh the current one i think the ordering
works out that they can do that

1510
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
works out that they can do that
 

1511
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,830
works out that they can do that
um because i think you'll get some good

1512
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:17,840
um because i think you'll get some good
 

1513
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,710
um because i think you'll get some good

first guys
 

1523
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,710
first guys
okay so in problem two uh we're talking

1524
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
okay so in problem two uh we're talking
 

1525
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,110
okay so in problem two uh we're talking
about

1526
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,120
about
 

1527
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,669
about
internet investigation uh so in

1528
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
internet investigation uh so in
 

1529
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,389
internet investigation uh so in
particular

1530
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
particular
 

1531
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,389

uh mit has a bunch of different routers

1532
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,399
uh mit has a bunch of different routers
 

1533
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,389
uh mit has a bunch of different routers
that are connected by cables uh to one

1534
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:38,399
that are connected by cables uh to one

another
and essentially uh what are we given

1538
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
and essentially uh what are we given
 

1539
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,909
and essentially uh what are we given
we're given a bunch of different routers

1540
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:43,919
we're given a bunch of different routers
 

1541
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,269
we're given a bunch of different routers
and we're given the length of the cable

1542
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:45,279
and we're given the length of the cable
 

1543
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,590
and we're given the length of the cable
in between them and the latency

1544
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:47,600
in between them and the latency
 

1545
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,950
in between them and the latency
unsurprisingly is proportional to the

1546
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
unsurprisingly is proportional to the
 

1547
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,630
unsurprisingly is proportional to the
length of the cable that

computers work kind of makes sense to me

1552
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
computers work kind of makes sense to me
 

1553
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,070
computers work kind of makes sense to me
i'm not sure that's actually true but

1554
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
i'm not sure that's actually true but
 

1555
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,950
i'm not sure that's actually true but
um that's sort of immaterial for 606.

1556
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
um that's sort of immaterial for 606.
 

1557

uh and essentially uh what we're trying

1564
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:07,679
uh and essentially uh what we're trying
 

1565
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,669
uh and essentially uh what we're trying
to do is sum up the latency

1566
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
to do is sum up the latency
 

1567
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,470
to do is sum up the latency
over all of the uh the router so let's

1568
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
over all of the uh the router so let's
 

1569
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,510
over all of the uh the router so let's
let's write down a little bit of

1570
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:13,520
let's write down a little bit of
 

1571
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,389
let's write down a little bit of
notation here

1572
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
notation here

1579
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,950

i need like a holster i feel like that

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
i need like a holster i feel like that
 

1581
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,590
i need like a holster i feel like that
would be useful for for the chalk bucket

1582
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
would be useful for for the chalk bucket
 

1583
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,269
would be useful for for the chalk bucket
okay so now we're going to do problem

1584
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
okay so now we're going to do problem
 

1585
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:42,470
okay so now we're going to do problem
2 here so we're given our routers

1586
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480

 

1587
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,149

and some of them

1588
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159

 

1589
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,950

are marked as entry points

1590
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960

 

1591
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,430

uh and now we have a bunch of

1592
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
uh and now we have a bunch of
 

1593
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:05,029
uh and now we have a bunch of
bi-directional wires

1594
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039

 

1595
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:11,029

wi each of which has length

1596
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039

 

1597
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,389

l i uh and that's a positive integer

1598
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
l i uh and that's a positive integer
 

1599
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,510
l i uh and that's a positive integer
value here

1600
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
value here
 

1601
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,029
value here
yep and uh actually because of this

1602
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
yep and uh actually because of this
 

1603
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,549
yep and uh actually because of this
so technically i think a lot of students

1604
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559
so technically i think a lot of students
 

1605
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,990
so technically i think a lot of students
in this class have encountered weighted

1606
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
in this class have encountered weighted
 

1607
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,590
in this class have encountered weighted
graphs before but if you think about the

1608
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,600
graphs before but if you think about the
 

1609
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,590
graphs before but if you think about the
narrative of of this course

1610
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
narrative of of this course
 

1611
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,430
narrative of of this course
i think for the version of this homework

1612
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
i think for the version of this homework
 

1613
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,870
i think for the version of this homework
we haven't really encountered

1614
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
we haven't really encountered
 

1615
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,389
we haven't really encountered
weighted graphs yet but a better way of

1616
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
weighted graphs yet but a better way of
 

1617
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,909
weighted graphs yet but a better way of
putting it rather than psychologically

1618
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
putting it rather than psychologically
 

1619
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,590
putting it rather than psychologically
diagnosing your instructors

1620
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
diagnosing your instructors
 

1621
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,590
diagnosing your instructors
uh is is that what we're going to find

1622
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:35,600
uh is is that what we're going to find
 

1623
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,789
uh is is that what we're going to find
is that they're often

1624
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
is that they're often
 

1625
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,070
is that they're often
problems that look like they're weighted

1626
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
problems that look like they're weighted
 

1627
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,510
problems that look like they're weighted
graph problems but they really aren't

1628
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
graph problems but they really aren't
 

1629
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,430
graph problems but they really aren't
and and this is a nice example

1630
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
and and this is a nice example
 

1631
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,630
and and this is a nice example
uh where that's the case okay uh so we

1632
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
uh where that's the case okay uh so we
 

1633
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,750
uh where that's the case okay uh so we
define latency

1634
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,760

 

1635
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,190

uh as follows that it's at least

1636
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,200
uh as follows that it's at least
 

1637
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,350
uh as follows that it's at least
proportional to um

1638
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
proportional to um
 

1639
00:29:51,360 --> 00:30:01,669
proportional to um
the shortest uh path to an entry point

1640
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679

 

1641
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,510

and now we have two additional

1642
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
and now we have two additional
 

1643
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,789
and now we have two additional
assumptions that we need

1644
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
assumptions that we need
 

1645
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,990
assumptions that we need
right one is that the total latency

1646
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
right one is that the total latency
 

1647
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,830
right one is that the total latency
uh or at least the latency of every

1648
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
uh or at least the latency of every
 

1649
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,230
uh or at least the latency of every
vertex

1650
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
vertex
 

1651
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,350
vertex
which is the same thing latency uh

1652
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
which is the same thing latency uh
 

1653
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,750
which is the same thing latency uh
is less than infinity what is this

1654
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
is less than infinity what is this
 

1655
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,909
is less than infinity what is this
really saying by the way

1656
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:19,919
really saying by the way
 

1657
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,669
really saying by the way
like when would the latency be infinity

1658
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
like when would the latency be infinity
 

1659
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,870
like when would the latency be infinity
it would only be infinity if i like took

1660
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
it would only be infinity if i like took
 

1661
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,549
it would only be infinity if i like took
a pair of scissors and cut a wire and

1662
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559
a pair of scissors and cut a wire and
 

1663
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,430
a pair of scissors and cut a wire and
would just connect it

1664
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
would just connect it
 

1665
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,310
would just connect it
from the rest of the network yes uh

1666
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
from the rest of the network yes uh
 

1667
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,430
from the rest of the network yes uh
every router

1668
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
every router
 

1669
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,590
every router

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:31,600
is connected to some entry point that's
 

1671
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,190
is connected to some entry point that's
exactly like there's some path from

1672
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
exactly like there's some path from
 

1673
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,190
exactly like there's some path from
every router to some entry point

1674
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200
every router to some entry point
 

1675
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,310
every router to some entry point
doesn't necessarily mean the entire

1676
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,320
doesn't necessarily mean the entire
 

1677
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,310
doesn't necessarily mean the entire
graph is connected i guess um

1678
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
graph is connected i guess um
 

1679
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,750
graph is connected i guess um
but at least that you can always get to

1680
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
but at least that you can always get to
 

1681
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,830
but at least that you can always get to
an entry point uh

1682
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
an entry point uh
 

1683
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,310
an entry point uh
and then moreover uh and this one's the

1684
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
and then moreover uh and this one's the
 

1685
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,430
and then moreover uh and this one's the
the real kicker here

1686
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:45,440
the real kicker here
 

1687
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,430
the real kicker here
uh that there's uh at most a hundred

1688
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
uh that there's uh at most a hundred
 

1689
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,830
uh that there's uh at most a hundred
r uh feet of wire

1690
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:55,840

 

1691
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,070

incidentally r stands for routers i had

like the problem the previous problem in
 

1695
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,430
like the problem the previous problem in
my head was thinking radius a long time

1696
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
my head was thinking radius a long time

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,830
my head was thinking radius a long time
um so don't be like your instructor and

1698
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
um so don't be like your instructor and
 

1699
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,350
um so don't be like your instructor and
actually read the entire problem before

getting
 

1703
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,710
getting
hung up on it but in any event the thing

1704
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:08,720
hung up on it but in any event the thing
 

1705
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,710
hung up on it but in any event the thing
that you're trying to

1706
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
that you're trying to
 

1707
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,549
that you're trying to
do is to compute

1708
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559

 

1709
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,710

the sum over all of the routers

1710
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
the sum over all of the routers
 

1711
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,230
the sum over all of the routers
uh i don't know are whatever

1712
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,240
uh i don't know are whatever
 

1713
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,430
uh i don't know are whatever
of the latency of of that router

1714
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:25,440
of the latency of of that router
 

1715
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,750
of the latency of of that router
okay so that's our our problem here

1716
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
okay so that's our our problem here
 

1717
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,549
okay so that's our our problem here
incidentally

1718

this little goofy exercise i just did of

1720
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,399
this little goofy exercise i just did of
 

1721
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,830
this little goofy exercise i just did of
taking this paragraph problem and kind

1722
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:31,840
taking this paragraph problem and kind
 

1723
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,110
taking this paragraph problem and kind
of writing in bullet points

1724
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
of writing in bullet points
 

1725
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,710
of writing in bullet points
i find helps me a lot when i'm trying to

1726
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
i find helps me a lot when i'm trying to
 

1727
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,149
i find helps me a lot when i'm trying to
solve these algorithms problems

1728
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
solve these algorithms problems
 

1729
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,669
solve these algorithms problems
because i think it's really easy to just

1730
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
because i think it's really easy to just
 

1731
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,509
because i think it's really easy to just
get like thrown off by a wall of text

1732
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
get like thrown off by a wall of text
 

1733
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,110
get like thrown off by a wall of text
here

1734
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
here
 

1735
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,830
here
okay so this problem is screaming out

1736
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
okay so this problem is screaming out
 

1737
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,789
okay so this problem is screaming out
graph theory

1738
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:44,799
graph theory
 

1739
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,470
graph theory
like we're practically like using the

1740
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
like we're practically like using the
 

1741
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,149
like we're practically like using the
terms here we are using the terms right

1742
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:48,159
terms here we are using the terms right
 

1743
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:48,710
terms here we are using the terms right
like you've got

1744
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
like you've got
 

1745
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,669
like you've got
nodes that are kind of like routers and

1746
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:51,679
nodes that are kind of like routers and
 

1747
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,350
nodes that are kind of like routers and
maybe edges or kind of like

1748
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,360
maybe edges or kind of like
 

1749
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,470
maybe edges or kind of like
wires but there's a bit of a catch which

1750
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
wires but there's a bit of a catch which
 

1751
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,830
wires but there's a bit of a catch which
is that your runtime

1752
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
is that your runtime
 

1753
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,350
is that your runtime
right at the end of the day i think you

1754
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
right at the end of the day i think you
 

1755
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,190
right at the end of the day i think you
want order r

1756
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200

 

1757
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,350

run time that's where things get a

1758
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,360
run time that's where things get a
 

1759
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,870
run time that's where things get a
little funky initially

1760
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
little funky initially
 

1761
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,950
little funky initially
um and so we have to think a little bit

1762
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
um and so we have to think a little bit
 

1763
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,029
um and so we have to think a little bit
carefully about how to do it

1764
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
carefully about how to do it
 

1765
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,509
carefully about how to do it
and here's going to be the the trick so

1766
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
and here's going to be the the trick so
 

1767
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,950
and here's going to be the the trick so
this is starting to look like a shortest

1768
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:14,960
this is starting to look like a shortest
 

1769
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,549
this is starting to look like a shortest
path problem but what would you

1770
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
path problem but what would you
 

1771
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,190
path problem but what would you
maybe not want to do would be to iterate

1772
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,200
maybe not want to do would be to iterate
 

1773
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,789
maybe not want to do would be to iterate
over every single router

1774
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799
over every single router
 

1775
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,110
over every single router
or every single vertex and every single

1776
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
or every single vertex and every single
 

1777
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,470
or every single vertex and every single
router and compute the shortest path

1778
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,480
router and compute the shortest path
 

1779
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,669

maybe to all the entry points and then

1796
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
maybe to all the entry points and then
 

1797
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,789
maybe to all the entry points and then
take the min or something like that

1798
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
take the min or something like that
 

1799
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,950
take the min or something like that
but if i had a double for loop then i'm

probably not going to get order our

probably not going to get order our
 

1803
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,470
probably not going to get order our
time right because somehow you expect it

1804
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,480
time right because somehow you expect it
 

1805
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,990

00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
supposed to be a little more sneaky than
 

1811
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,549
supposed to be a little more sneaky than
that and we're going to use a sort of a

1812
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559
that and we're going to use a sort of a
 

1813
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,230
that and we're going to use a sort of a
canonical uh trick

1814
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
canonical uh trick
 

1815
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,590
canonical uh trick
in graph theory okay so let's uh let's

1816
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
in graph theory okay so let's uh let's
 

1817
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,149
in graph theory okay so let's uh let's
follow the

1818
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
follow the
 

1819
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,070
follow the
the toucan sam approach here we're gonna

1820
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
the toucan sam approach here we're gonna
 

1821
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,190
the toucan sam approach here we're gonna
follow our nose

1822
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
follow our nose
 

1823
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,509
follow our nose
and say that okay there's basically a

1824
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:03,519
and say that okay there's basically a
 

1825
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,389
and say that okay there's basically a
graph

1826
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
graph
 

1827
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,149
graph
that's uh staring us in the face in this

1828
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:06,159
that's uh staring us in the face in this
 

1829
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,509
that's uh staring us in the face in this
problem

1830
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:07,519
problem
 

1831
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,389
problem
but then we're gonna have to make a

1832
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
but then we're gonna have to make a
 

1833
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,750
but then we're gonna have to make a
little bit of an edit because we'd like

1834
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:09,760
little bit of an edit because we'd like
 

1835
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,789
little bit of an edit because we'd like
to use

1836
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
to use
 

1837
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,590
to use
the kind of linear looking time search

1838
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
the kind of linear looking time search
 

1839
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,110
the kind of linear looking time search
uh that that bfs

1840
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
uh that that bfs
 

1841
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,029
uh that that bfs
affords us but it looks like we have

1842
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
affords us but it looks like we have
 

1843
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,549
affords us but it looks like we have
edge weights in our graph right because

1844
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
edge weights in our graph right because
 

1845
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,509
edge weights in our graph right because
the wires

1846
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
the wires
 

1847
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,310
the wires
are associated to uh lengths right

1848
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,320
are associated to uh lengths right
 

1849
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,389
are associated to uh lengths right
different wires have different sizes

1850
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
different wires have different sizes
 

1851
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,630
different wires have different sizes
but we have this nice fun fact which is

1852
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:26,640
but we have this nice fun fact which is
 

1853
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,310
but we have this nice fun fact which is
of the total amount of wire and our

1854
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320
of the total amount of wire and our
 

1855
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,750
of the total amount of wire and our
whole universe is less than 100r

1856
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
whole universe is less than 100r
 

1857
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,269
whole universe is less than 100r
i guess the units of this 100 are kind

00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
i guess the units of this 100 are kind

00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
i can be a little bit sneaky about this

10 feet of wires
i'm going to have 10 one foot wires yeah

i'm going to have 10 one foot wires yeah

i'm going to have 10 one foot wires yeah
except now i'm additionally going to

00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
have you know

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,909
have you know
little chains so here maybe the length

1894
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:21,919
little chains so here maybe the length
 

1895
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,109

l one two is equal to three right so i'm

1896
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:25,119
l one two is equal to three right so i'm
 

1897
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,589
l one two is equal to three right so i'm
gonna put

1898
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
gonna put
 

1899
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,270
gonna put
three edges in between um so in other

1900
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
three edges in between um so in other

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,230

and i'm gonna i'm gonna connect them

1904
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,240
and i'm gonna i'm gonna connect them
 

1905
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,149
and i'm gonna i'm gonna connect them
with chains

edges for each wire
 

1911
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,550
edges for each wire
that makes sense so essentially i'm

1912
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:50,560
that makes sense so essentially i'm
 

1913
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,389
that makes sense so essentially i'm
going to take my weighted graph problem

1914
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399
going to take my weighted graph problem
 

1915
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:52,950
going to take my weighted graph problem
and make it

1916
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:52,960
and make it
 

1917
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,470
and make it
unweighted by just like repeating a

1918
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
unweighted by just like repeating a

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,829
unweighted by just like repeating a
bunch of well not really repeating but

1920
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839
bunch of well not really repeating but
 

1921
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,670
bunch of well not really repeating but
chaining together a bunch of edges

1922
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:57,680
chaining together a bunch of edges
 

1923
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,230
chaining together a bunch of edges
uh so that the total length of this

1924
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
uh so that the total length of this
 

1925
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,829
uh so that the total length of this
thing uh is equal to the distance from

1926
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:01,839
thing uh is equal to the distance from
 

1927
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,069
thing uh is equal to the distance from
one router to another

1928
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
one router to another
 

1929
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,109
one router to another
okay one thing we might as well do is

1930
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
okay one thing we might as well do is
 

1931
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,790
okay one thing we might as well do is
bound the number of vertices and edges

1932
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:08,800
bound the number of vertices and edges
 

1933
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,710
bound the number of vertices and edges
in our graph when we do that

1934
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:10,720
in our graph when we do that
 

1935
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,670
in our graph when we do that
so first of all

1936
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680

 

1937
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,069

let's think about the number of vertices

1938
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:18,079
let's think about the number of vertices
 

1939
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,750
let's think about the number of vertices
and we can be totally lazy and upper

1940
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:19,760
and we can be totally lazy and upper
 

1941
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,430
and we can be totally lazy and upper
bound this stuff it doesn't matter

1942
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
bound this stuff it doesn't matter
 

1943
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,750
bound this stuff it doesn't matter
well for one thing i have one node per

1944
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:23,760
well for one thing i have one node per
 

1945
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,750
well for one thing i have one node per
router so we incur one factor of

1946
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:25,760
router so we incur one factor of
 

1947
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,950
router so we incur one factor of
r there and now

1948
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:28,960
r there and now
 

1949
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,710
r there and now
notice that we're kind of laying down

1950
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:30,720
notice that we're kind of laying down
 

1951
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,109
notice that we're kind of laying down
cable one little piece at a time here in

1952
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:33,119
cable one little piece at a time here in
 

1953
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,190
cable one little piece at a time here in
our chains

1954
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,200
our chains
 

1955
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,190
our chains
and now i always uh tend to have a fence

1956
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,200
and now i always uh tend to have a fence
 

1957
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,470
and now i always uh tend to have a fence

factor is here but if we're conservative

1962
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,000
factor is here but if we're conservative
 

1963
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,950

about it

1964
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:42,960
about it
 

1965
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,829
about it
uh you know we incur at most a factor of

1966
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
uh you know we incur at most a factor of
 

1967
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,030
uh you know we incur at most a factor of
100 are

1968
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
100 are
 

1969
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,710
100 are
kind of additional edges because those

1970
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
kind of additional edges because those
 

1971
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,829
kind of additional edges because those
are all the different pieces that we

1972
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:49,839
are all the different pieces that we
 

1973
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:50,630
are all the different pieces that we
could lay together

1974
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
could lay together
 

1975
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,990
could lay together
it's actually less than that because of

1976
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
it's actually less than that because of
 

1977
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,990
it's actually less than that because of
the endpoints but whatever

1978
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,000
the endpoints but whatever
 

1979
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,349
the endpoints but whatever
uh because r plus 100r is big o

1980
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
uh because r plus 100r is big o
 

1981
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,589
uh because r plus 100r is big o
of r so the number of vertices in my

1982
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
of r so the number of vertices in my
 

1983
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,150
of r so the number of vertices in my
graph here is big o of r

1984
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,160
graph here is big o of r
 

1985
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,430
graph here is big o of r
similarly what's the number of edges

1986
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440

 

1987
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,990

well this is exactly the amount of cable

1988
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
well this is exactly the amount of cable
 

1989
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,069
well this is exactly the amount of cable
uh that's inside of my network

1990
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:12,079
uh that's inside of my network
 

1991
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,630
uh that's inside of my network
i believe yep right so this is exactly

1992
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
i believe yep right so this is exactly
 

1993
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,510
i believe yep right so this is exactly
100r

1994
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520

 

1995
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,109

well i guess the way the problem is

1996
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
well i guess the way the problem is
 

1997
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,589
well i guess the way the problem is
written it's uh upper bounded by a 100r

1998
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
written it's uh upper bounded by a 100r
 

1999
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,710
written it's uh upper bounded by a 100r
but whatever

2000
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:22,720
but whatever
 

2001
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,230
but whatever
um so this again is big o of

2002
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,240
um so this again is big o of
 

2003
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,390
um so this again is big o of
r this is kind of convenient so now we

2004
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,400
r this is kind of convenient so now we
 

2005
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,829
r this is kind of convenient so now we
have one number that rules them all

2006
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:29,839
have one number that rules them all
 

2007
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,670
have one number that rules them all
right which is r which tells you both

2008
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
right which is r which tells you both
 

2009
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,109
right which is r which tells you both
the number of vertices and the number of

2010
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
the number of vertices and the number of
 

2011
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,910
the number of vertices and the number of
edges

2012
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:33,920
edges
 

2013
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,069
edges
up to a constant factor right so one

2014
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
up to a constant factor right so one
 

2015
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,670
up to a constant factor right so one
thing i can convince myself is if i do

2016
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:37,680
thing i can convince myself is if i do
 

2017
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,750
thing i can convince myself is if i do
bfs on my graph that's sort of okay

2018
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
bfs on my graph that's sort of okay
 

2019
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,710
bfs on my graph that's sort of okay
remember that's

2020
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:40,720
remember that's
 

2021
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,190
remember that's
vertices plus edges time uh but in this

2022
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
vertices plus edges time uh but in this
 

2023
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,510
vertices plus edges time uh but in this
case uh those are the same

2024
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:45,520
case uh those are the same
 

2025
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,510
case uh those are the same
okay so uh right so remember at the end

2026
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:49,520
okay so uh right so remember at the end
 

2027
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,790
okay so uh right so remember at the end
of the day i'm trying to compute the

2028
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,800
of the day i'm trying to compute the
 

2029
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,430
of the day i'm trying to compute the
latency

2030
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:51,440
latency
 

2031
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,589
latency
this is like the length of the shortest

2032
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:53,599
this is like the length of the shortest
 

2033
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,870
this is like the length of the shortest
path

2034
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:54,880
path
 

2035
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,230
path
to the entry point nodes

2036
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
to the entry point nodes
 

2037
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,150
to the entry point nodes
so here would be a braindead algorithm

2038
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,160
so here would be a braindead algorithm
 

2039
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,589
so here would be a braindead algorithm
which is to say

2040
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
which is to say
 

2041
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,870
which is to say
for all routers

2042
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880

 

2043
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,950

for all entry points

2044

2045
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,470

you know compute

2046
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480

 

2047
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,270

i don't know let's call the router on i

the entry point j
 

2051
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,870

i compute distance i j like using

2052
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
i compute distance i j like using
 

2053
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,630
i compute distance i j like using
breadth first search or something

uh and then i you know uh

2056
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
uh and then i you know uh
 

2057
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,349

2061
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,910

and add them all together right so i

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:35,920
and add them all together right so i
 

2063
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,870

2101
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,069

well this would take order r squared

2102
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:14,079
well this would take order r squared
 

2103
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,829
well this would take order r squared
whoa r squared time right um

okay so we need a better trick
uh and this is actually sort of one of

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,640
just the remaining non-entry point
 

2161
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,990
just the remaining non-entry point
routers on the right

2162
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,000
routers on the right
 

2163
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,310
routers on the right
because i can uh and so this is what my

2164
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,320
because i can uh and so this is what my
 

2165
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,750
because i can uh and so this is what my
graph looks like so these are like my

2166
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:13,760
graph looks like so these are like my
 

2167
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,550
graph looks like so these are like my
entry points

2168
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560

 

2169
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,510

you know here are my other routers

2170
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:21,520

 

2171
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,270

my graph doesn't have to be bipartite

2172
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
my graph doesn't have to be bipartite
 

2173
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,790
my graph doesn't have to be bipartite
like it could be that my routers are

2174
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
like it could be that my routers are
 

2175
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,150
like it could be that my routers are
connected to each other

2176
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,160
connected to each other
 

2177
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,790
connected to each other
whatever um and then there's some some

2178
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:28,800
whatever um and then there's some some
 

2179
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,190
whatever um and then there's some some
you know

2180
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,200
you know
 

2181
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,829
you know
edges that go from my entry points to

2182
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:31,839
edges that go from my entry points to
 

2183
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,190
edges that go from my entry points to
the routers in the graph

2184
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
the routers in the graph
 

2185
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,550
the routers in the graph
trying to make sure that my graph is

2186
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:34,560
trying to make sure that my graph is
 

2187
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,310
trying to make sure that my graph is
connected okay

2188
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,320
connected okay
 

2189
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,349
connected okay
right and so essentially what this

2190
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:37,359
right and so essentially what this
 

2191
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,990
right and so essentially what this
problem is asking you to do uh is to say

2192
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,000
problem is asking you to do uh is to say
 

2193
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,990
problem is asking you to do uh is to say
okay for every single note in my graph

2194
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
okay for every single note in my graph
 

2195
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,990
okay for every single note in my graph
i need to compute the the distance to

2196
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
i need to compute the the distance to
 

2197
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,510
i need to compute the the distance to
the closest

2198
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520
the closest
 

2199
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,430
the closest
entry point and then sum all those

2200
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
entry point and then sum all those
 

2201
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,550
entry point and then sum all those
things together

2202
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
things together
 

2203
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,069
things together
right that's the schematic we could have

2204
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:50,079
right that's the schematic we could have
 

2205
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,950
right that's the schematic we could have
in mind

2206
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:52,960

 

2207
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,230

so in some sense

2208
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,240
so in some sense
 

2209
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,910
so in some sense
what we want to do is think about the

2210
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:57,920
what we want to do is think about the
 

2211
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,270
what we want to do is think about the
set of entry points as like one

2212
00:39:59,270 --> 00:39:59,280
set of entry points as like one
 

2213
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,510
set of entry points as like one
giant node right because it doesn't

2214
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:01,520
giant node right because it doesn't
 

2215
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,270
giant node right because it doesn't
matter which of

2216
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,280
matter which of
 

2217
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,349
matter which of
these guys i choose for my shortest path

2218
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,359
these guys i choose for my shortest path
 

2219
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,349
these guys i choose for my shortest path
uh to an entry point i just need to find

2220
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:07,359
uh to an entry point i just need to find
 

2221
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,069
uh to an entry point i just need to find
one

2222
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:08,079
one
 

2223
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,230
one
yeah and so here's the basic trick and

2224
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
yeah and so here's the basic trick and
 

2225
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,190
yeah and so here's the basic trick and
this is one that appears

2226
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:11,200
this is one that appears
 

2227
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,630
this is one that appears
all over graph theory which is i'm going

2228
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:12,640
all over graph theory which is i'm going
 

2229
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,550
all over graph theory which is i'm going
to introduce one additional note to my

2230
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
to introduce one additional note to my
 

2231
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,030
to introduce one additional note to my
graph

2232
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,040
graph
 

2233
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,790
graph
and i'm going to put him on the left

2234
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:16,800
and i'm going to put him on the left
 

2235
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,510
and i'm going to put him on the left
hand side he's really big because he

2236
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:19,520
hand side he's really big because he
 

2237
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,109
hand side he's really big because he
is a super note

2238
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:23,119

 

2239
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,589

which is a term of art uh this term

2240
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:25,599
which is a term of art uh this term
 

2241
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,390
which is a term of art uh this term
shows up a lot

2242
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
shows up a lot
 

2243
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,349
shows up a lot
and i'm gonna connect it to every

2244
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:31,359

 

2245
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,990

entry point in uh in my my network of

2246
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
entry point in uh in my my network of
 

2247
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,150
entry point in uh in my my network of
routers

2248
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
routers
 

2249
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,829
routers
does that make sense class okay

2250
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:39,839
does that make sense class okay
 

2251
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,309
does that make sense class okay
so here's the here's the kind of cool

2252
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:42,319
so here's the here's the kind of cool
 

2253
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,829
so here's the here's the kind of cool
thing so first of all for every entry

2254
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:43,839
thing so first of all for every entry
 

2255
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:44,710
thing so first of all for every entry
point

2256
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:44,720
point
 

2257
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,390
point
what's the the shortest path from the

2258
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,400
what's the the shortest path from the
 

2259
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,230
what's the the shortest path from the
entry point to the super node

2260
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,240
entry point to the super node
 

2261
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,990
entry point to the super node
well obviously it has length one right i

2262
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,000
well obviously it has length one right i
 

2263
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,069
well obviously it has length one right i
drew it for you here

2264
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
drew it for you here
 

2265
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,150
drew it for you here
now here's the thing let's take the

2266
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
now here's the thing let's take the
 

2267
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,069
now here's the thing let's take the
shortest path from the super node

2268
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:56,079
shortest path from the super node
 

2269
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,069
shortest path from the super node
to any of the routers on the right hand

what do i know well clearly like maybe i

2274
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:01,920
what do i know well clearly like maybe i
 

2275
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,309
what do i know well clearly like maybe i
choose this guy here

2276
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:04,319
choose this guy here
 

2277
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,910
choose this guy here
well what is my shortest path it goes

2278
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:05,920
well what is my shortest path it goes
 

2279
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,630
well what is my shortest path it goes
here and then there

2280
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:08,640
here and then there
 

2281
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,069
here and then there
there's one property that matters here

2282
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
there's one property that matters here
 

2283
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,270
there's one property that matters here
which is that it has to pass through

2284
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,280
which is that it has to pass through
 

2285
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,710
which is that it has to pass through
one of these entry notes which one does

2286
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:16,720
one of these entry notes which one does
 

2287
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,270
one of these entry notes which one does
it has to pass through

2288
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,280
it has to pass through
 

2289
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,790
it has to pass through
shrek for shame well remember

2290
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:22,800
shrek for shame well remember
 

2291
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,630
shrek for shame well remember
uh the justin's favorite inequality is

2292
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
uh the justin's favorite inequality is
 

2293
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,309
uh the justin's favorite inequality is
the triangle inequality

2294
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:26,319
the triangle inequality
 

2295
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,910
the triangle inequality
and what does it say it says that if i

2296
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
and what does it say it says that if i
 

2297
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,069
and what does it say it says that if i
compute the shortest path

2298
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:30,079
compute the shortest path
 

2299
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,390
compute the shortest path
from the super node to any node in my

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,400
from the super node to any node in my
 

2301
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,430
from the super node to any node in my

then every sort of sub piece of that

2304
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
then every sort of sub piece of that
 

2305
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,790
then every sort of sub piece of that

shortest path
 

2307
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,109
shortest path
is also a shortest path that sentence

2308
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:39,119
is also a shortest path that sentence
 

2309
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:39,990
is also a shortest path that sentence
was hard to parse

2310
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,000
was hard to parse
 

2311
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,630
was hard to parse
let's try that again so in particular if

2312
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
let's try that again so in particular if
 

2313
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,069
let's try that again so in particular if
i have a graph from the super node to

2314
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:44,079
i have a graph from the super node to
 

2315
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,910
i have a graph from the super node to
some router over here

2316
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
some router over here
 

2317
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,349
some router over here
well we've convinced ourselves it has to

2318
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,359
well we've convinced ourselves it has to
 

2319
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,390
well we've convinced ourselves it has to
pass through one of the entry nodes

2320
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:50,400
pass through one of the entry nodes
 

2321
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,670
pass through one of the entry nodes
which one does it have to pass through

2322
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
which one does it have to pass through
 

2323
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,990
which one does it have to pass through
is it ever something that is farther

2324
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
is it ever something that is farther
 

2325
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,109
is it ever something that is farther
than the closest entry node

2326
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
than the closest entry node
 

2327
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,790
than the closest entry node
well no because i could compute a

2328
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
well no because i could compute a
 

2329
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,230
well no because i could compute a
shorter path in that case

2330
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240
shorter path in that case
 

2331
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,150
shorter path in that case
by choosing the closest entry mode and

2332
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,160
by choosing the closest entry mode and
 

2333
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,550
by choosing the closest entry mode and
then going to the super node

2334
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560
then going to the super node
 

2335
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,790
then going to the super node
so uh this is a complicated way of

2336
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:06,800
so uh this is a complicated way of
 

2337
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,309
so uh this is a complicated way of
saying that essentially what we really

2338
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,319
saying that essentially what we really
 

2339
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,190
saying that essentially what we really
want

2340
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200

 

2341
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,430

is for every router

2342
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,440
is for every router
 

2343
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,309
is for every router
the distance from that router let's call

2344
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:20,319
the distance from that router let's call
 

2345
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,069
the distance from that router let's call
it i

2346
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:22,079
it i
 

2347
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,230
it i
to the super node s

2348
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,240

 

2349
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,750

is that quite right is that the distance

2350
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
is that quite right is that the distance
 

2351
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,550
is that quite right is that the distance
to the closest uh entry point

2352
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:30,560
to the closest uh entry point
 

2353
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,870
to the closest uh entry point
one you went one more inch too far i

2354
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
one you went one more inch too far i
 

2355
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,470
one you went one more inch too far i
went one inch too far right because i

2356
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:34,480
went one inch too far right because i
 

2357
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,069
went one inch too far right because i
went to the closest entry point

2358
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
went to the closest entry point
 

2359
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,430
went to the closest entry point
and then i took an additional edge so we

2360
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
and then i took an additional edge so we
 

2361
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,470
and then i took an additional edge so we
want to do minus one

2362
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:40,480
want to do minus one
 

2363
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,190
want to do minus one
okay so what does this mean well that

2364
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200
okay so what does this mean well that
 

2365
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,150
okay so what does this mean well that
means that i don't

2366
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
means that i don't
 

2367
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,630
means that i don't
actually have to have this inner for

2368
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:46,640
actually have to have this inner for
 

2369
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,790
actually have to have this inner for
loop over all the possible entry points

2370
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
loop over all the possible entry points
 

2371
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,470

i just need to construct this new

2372
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:50,480
i just need to construct this new
 

2373
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,309
i just need to construct this new
special graph with one additional node

2374
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:52,319
special graph with one additional node
 

2375
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,430
special graph with one additional node
notice that's not going to affect my

2376
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:53,440
notice that's not going to affect my
 

2377
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,550
notice that's not going to affect my

00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,240
and compute the shortest distance from
 

2381
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,910
and compute the shortest distance from
the super node to every other node in my

00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
and then use that as my output yeah so
 

2387
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,510
and then use that as my output yeah so
in other words

2388
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520

 

2389
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,589

what is my algorithm going to look like

2390
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
what is my algorithm going to look like
 

2391
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,870
what is my algorithm going to look like
well first

2392
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:08,880
well first
 

2393
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,470
well first
i'm going to construct

2394
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:12,480
i'm going to construct
 

2395
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,470
i'm going to construct
my graph right so what do i need to do i

2396
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:14,480
my graph right so what do i need to do i
 

2397
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,390
my graph right so what do i need to do i
have uh if i were to write this out on

2398
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
have uh if i were to write this out on
 

2399
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,750
have uh if i were to write this out on
my homework i would have to talk about

2400
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
my homework i would have to talk about
 

2401
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,230
my homework i would have to talk about
how

2402
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
how
 

2403
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,990
how
i've got these chains of edges between

2404
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:20,000
i've got these chains of edges between
 

2405
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,430
i've got these chains of edges between
different pairs of routers

2406
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
different pairs of routers
 

2407
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,630
different pairs of routers
in addition to that i'm going to make

2408
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:22,640
in addition to that i'm going to make
 

2409
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,710
in addition to that i'm going to make
one additional super node uh

2410
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:24,720
one additional super node uh
 

2411
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,550
one additional super node uh
and and insert an edge from that to

2412
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,560
and and insert an edge from that to
 

2413
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,870
and and insert an edge from that to
every uh entry point

2414
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
every uh entry point
 

2415
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,069
every uh entry point
uh notice that adding the uh

2416
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:32,079
uh notice that adding the uh
 

2417
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,829
uh notice that adding the uh
entry point here just adds a one to the

2418
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
entry point here just adds a one to the
 

2419
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,190
entry point here just adds a one to the
number of vertices

2420
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,200
number of vertices
 

2421
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,829
number of vertices
and at most i guess an r to the number

2422
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:37,839
and at most i guess an r to the number
 

2423
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,829
and at most i guess an r to the number
of edges which doesn't affect

2424
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:39,839
of edges which doesn't affect
 

2425
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,670
of edges which doesn't affect
asymptotically the size of either of

2426
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:41,680
asymptotically the size of either of
 

2427
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,309
asymptotically the size of either of
these two sets so that's a good thing

2428
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:44,319
these two sets so that's a good thing
 

2429
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,670
these two sets so that's a good thing
now i'm going to do

2430
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,680
now i'm going to do
 

2431
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,510
now i'm going to do
i'm going to use a bff

2432
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:51,520
i'm going to use a bff
 

2433
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,550
i'm going to use a bff
to do a single

2434
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
to do a single
 

2435
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,670
to do a single
source shortest path from

2436
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
source shortest path from
 

2437
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,710

00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720
my super node to
 

2439
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,910
my super node to
all other vertices

2440
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:05,920

 

2441
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,550

and how much time does this take well

2442
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
and how much time does this take well
 

2443
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,309
and how much time does this take well
remember that in general bfs takes v

2444
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
remember that in general bfs takes v
 

2445
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,950
remember that in general bfs takes v
plus e time in this case v plus e are

2446
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
plus e time in this case v plus e are
 

2447
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,990
plus e time in this case v plus e are
both

2448
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
both
 

2449
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,550
both
you know look like r so this is order r

2450
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,560
you know look like r so this is order r
 

2451
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,390
you know look like r so this is order r
time

2452
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:18,400
time
 

2453
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,589
time
okay uh and then finally

2454
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
okay uh and then finally
 

2455
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,870
okay uh and then finally
i'm going to sum over

2456
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
i'm going to sum over
 

2457
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,950
i'm going to sum over
router's

2458
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:30,960

 

2459
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,790

i the value of the distance

2460
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:34,800
i the value of the distance
 

2461
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,670
i the value of the distance
from the super node to the router i

2462
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
from the super node to the router i
 

2463
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,349
from the super node to the router i
minus one to account for that that

2464
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359
minus one to account for that that
 

2465
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,870
minus one to account for that that
additional edge that i added

2466
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:40,880
additional edge that i added
 

2467
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,309
additional edge that i added
okay and that's the solution to our

2468
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:42,319
okay and that's the solution to our
 

2469
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,309
okay and that's the solution to our
problem

2470

00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:46,960
okay any questions about uh number two
 

2473
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,390
okay any questions about uh number two
here

2474
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
here
 

2475
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,589
here
excellent go team okay so now uh let's

2476
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
excellent go team okay so now uh let's
 

2477
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,349
excellent go team okay so now uh let's
move on to problem three

2478
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:53,359
move on to problem three
 

2479
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,390
move on to problem three
am i yeah we're about halfway uh okay

2480
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
am i yeah we're about halfway uh okay
 

2481
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,470
am i yeah we're about halfway uh okay
so in problem three right so we're doing

2482
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:00,480
so in problem three right so we're doing
 

2483
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,550
so in problem three right so we're doing
um

2484
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
um
 

2485
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,630
um
poetry harder and three wizard friends

2486
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:06,640
poetry harder and three wizard friends
 

2487
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,150
poetry harder and three wizard friends
the number three here i believe is

2488
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,160
the number three here i believe is
 

2489
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,150
the number three here i believe is
actually irrelevant um

2490
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,160
actually irrelevant um
 

2491
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,510
actually irrelevant um
although like anytime you see a specific

2492
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
although like anytime you see a specific
 

2493
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,950
although like anytime you see a specific
number in a problem like you should you

2494
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:12,960
number in a problem like you should you
 

2495
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,430
number in a problem like you should you
know

2496
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:13,440
know
 

2497
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,950
know
cash that in your bag of things to

2498
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:14,960
cash that in your bag of things to
 

2499
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,870
cash that in your bag of things to
remember and in this case that was a

2500
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:16,880
remember and in this case that was a
 

2501
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,309
remember and in this case that was a
that was a red herring um padre harder

2502
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:20,319
that was a red herring um padre harder
 

2503
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,069
that was a red herring um padre harder
and um her three wizard friends uh

2504
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079
and um her three wizard friends uh
 

2505
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,910
and um her three wizard friends uh
are tasked with searching around a

2506
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
are tasked with searching around a
 

2507
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,510
are tasked with searching around a
labyrinth yeah

2508
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:27,520
labyrinth yeah
 

2509
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,589
labyrinth yeah
uh and and in particular uh there's some

2510
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
uh and and in particular uh there's some
 

2511
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,069
uh and and in particular uh there's some
some some nice things to know about

2512
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:32,079
some some nice things to know about
 

2513
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,190
some some nice things to know about
the labyrinth and patri-harder world

2514
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,200
the labyrinth and patri-harder world
 

2515
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,950
the labyrinth and patri-harder world
which has really thrown off my dyslexia

2516
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:36,960
which has really thrown off my dyslexia
 

2517
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,870
which has really thrown off my dyslexia
here

2518
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:38,880
here
 

2519
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,030
here
which is the following um

2520
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040

 

2521
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,990

right so what do we know we know that

2522
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,000
right so what do we know we know that
 

2523
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,470
right so what do we know we know that
there are

2524
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480
there are
 

2525
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:54,150
there are
n rooms uh in my labyrinth

2526
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,160

 

2527
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,430

uh and that each of my rooms uh

2528
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
uh and that each of my rooms uh
 

2529
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,550
uh and that each of my rooms uh
has at most four doors

2530
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560

 

2531
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,589

okay um so in other words uh if i think

2532
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:07,599
okay um so in other words uh if i think
 

2533
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,790
okay um so in other words uh if i think
of building a graph

2534
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,800
of building a graph
 

2535
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,630
of building a graph
out of my rooms which is like i don't

2536
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:10,640
out of my rooms which is like i don't
 

2537
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,069
out of my rooms which is like i don't
think i'm giving much away about

2538
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
think i'm giving much away about
 

2539
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,510
think i'm giving much away about
about this problem by like jumping to

2540
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,520
about this problem by like jumping to
 

2541
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,430
about this problem by like jumping to
the solution a little bit uh

2542
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
the solution a little bit uh
 

2543
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,190
the solution a little bit uh
what do we know about the degree of any

2544
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200
what do we know about the degree of any
 

2545
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,109
what do we know about the degree of any
vertex assuming my vertices are rooms in

2546
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:19,119
vertex assuming my vertices are rooms in
 

2547
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,510
vertex assuming my vertices are rooms in
the labyrinth

2548
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
the labyrinth
 

2549
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,829
the labyrinth
is it most four so that's kind of nice

2550
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:23,839
is it most four so that's kind of nice
 

2551
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,510
is it most four so that's kind of nice
uh okay

2552
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,520
uh okay
 

2553
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,950
uh okay
right uh and all the doors start closed

2554
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960

 

2555
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,109

so that seems like a useful piece of

2556
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
so that seems like a useful piece of
 

2557
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,030
so that seems like a useful piece of
information to remember

2558
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
information to remember
 

2559
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,430
information to remember
um but we have this kind of weird thing

2560
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440
um but we have this kind of weird thing
 

2561
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,309
um but we have this kind of weird thing
which is that

2562
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:38,319
which is that
 

2563
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:43,109
which is that
some doors

2564
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:43,119
some doors
 

2565
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,030
some doors
are enchanted

2566
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040

 

2567
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,150

and apparently uh pop oh my

2568
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
and apparently uh pop oh my
 

2569
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,829
and apparently uh pop oh my
uh pottery harder uh can open up

2570
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:53,839
uh pottery harder uh can open up
 

2571
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,829
uh pottery harder uh can open up
uh certain doors for free which are not

2572
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
uh certain doors for free which are not
 

2573
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:56,870
uh certain doors for free which are not
the enchanted doors

2574
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:56,880
the enchanted doors
 

2575
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,550
the enchanted doors
and then other ones they have to like

2576
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
and then other ones they have to like
 

2577
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,309
and then other ones they have to like
you know do the blessing and the holy

2578
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:00,319
you know do the blessing and the holy
 

2579
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,910
you know do the blessing and the holy
water and whatever it is that

2580
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:01,920
water and whatever it is that
 

2581
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,390
water and whatever it is that
that happens in in in this universe uh

2582
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:04,400
that happens in in in this universe uh
 

2583
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,750
that happens in in in this universe uh
and then opens up that door

2584
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:05,760
and then opens up that door
 

2585
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,230
and then opens up that door
um but that costs them materials and and

2586
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
um but that costs them materials and and
 

2587
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,109
um but that costs them materials and and
um heartache

2588
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:09,119
um heartache
 

2589
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,750
um heartache
right and so we wanted to minimize that

2590
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
right and so we wanted to minimize that
 

2591
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,270
right and so we wanted to minimize that
right and so what they're given

2592
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280

 

2593
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,750

is basically a map right and this

2594
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,760
is basically a map right and this
 

2595
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,510
is basically a map right and this
includes all of the different rooms

2596
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:19,520
includes all of the different rooms
 

2597
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,950
includes all of the different rooms
how they're connected to one another and

2598
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:20,960
how they're connected to one another and
 

2599
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,670
how they're connected to one another and
which of the doors are enchanted

2600
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
which of the doors are enchanted
 

2601
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,470
which of the doors are enchanted
and what i want

2602
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:28,480

 

2603
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,910

is the minimum number of doors that they

2604
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:31,920
is the minimum number of doors that they
 

2605
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,829
is the minimum number of doors that they
have to

2606
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:36,839

2609
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,870
disenchant
okay now this problem is like kind of

2610
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:40,880
okay now this problem is like kind of
 

2611
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,069
okay now this problem is like kind of
sneaky

2612
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
sneaky
 

2613
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,430
sneaky
uh and and the reason why is that

2614
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:45,440
uh and and the reason why is that
 

2615
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,710
uh and and the reason why is that
there's like the the network that's

2616
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
there's like the the network that's
 

2617
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,829
there's like the the network that's
obvious to build

2618
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:47,839
obvious to build
 

2619
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,710
obvious to build
uh and that turns out to be not quite

2620
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
uh and that turns out to be not quite
 

2621
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,990
uh and that turns out to be not quite
the right one and then you can start

2622
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
the right one and then you can start
 

2623
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,270
the right one and then you can start
thinking about adding weights on your

2624
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
thinking about adding weights on your
 

2625
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,710
thinking about adding weights on your
graph and going crazy with that but that

2626
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:54,720
graph and going crazy with that but that
 

2627
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,270
graph and going crazy with that but that
turns out not to be the right direction

2628
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:57,280
turns out not to be the right direction
 

2629
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,150
turns out not to be the right direction
and in fact in poetry harder world um

2630
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,160
and in fact in poetry harder world um
 

2631
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,430
and in fact in poetry harder world um
apparently we're not worried about their

2632
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,440
apparently we're not worried about their
 

2633
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,230
apparently we're not worried about their
physical fitness

2634
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,240
physical fitness
 

2635
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,630
physical fitness
in other words like shortest paths are

2636
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,640
in other words like shortest paths are
 

2637
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,990
in other words like shortest paths are
actually irrelevant in this problem

2638
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
actually irrelevant in this problem
 

2639
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,589
actually irrelevant in this problem
do you see that because like let's say

2640
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:07,599
do you see that because like let's say
 

2641
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,990
do you see that because like let's say
that i have

2642
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
that i have
 

2643
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,190
that i have
a really complicated uh

2644
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
a really complicated uh
 

2645
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,349
a really complicated uh
annoying problem so like you know maybe

2646
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
annoying problem so like you know maybe
 

2647
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,950
annoying problem so like you know maybe
i have you know here's

2648
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:16,960
i have you know here's

and um no we don't even talk about the

2652
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:23,839
and um no we don't even talk about the
 

2653
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,589
and um no we don't even talk about the
entry point like where they actually go

say that they enter my labyrinth here

2660
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
say that they enter my labyrinth here
 

2661
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,270
say that they enter my labyrinth here
uh and that just to be annoying the two

2662
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:33,280
uh and that just to be annoying the two
 

2663
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,109
uh and that just to be annoying the two
doors that are enchanted remember we

2664
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
doors that are enchanted remember we
 

2665
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,230
doors that are enchanted remember we
could make a graph where all the

2666
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:36,240
could make a graph where all the
 

2667
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,829
could make a graph where all the
vertices or rooms and the edges are

2668
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:37,839
vertices or rooms and the edges are
 

2669
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,030
vertices or rooms and the edges are
doors

2670
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,040
doors
 

2671
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,030
doors
are like at these two endpoints of the t

2672
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
are like at these two endpoints of the t
 

2673
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,630
are like at these two endpoints of the t
so i have a giant t and i enter right in

2674
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:42,640
so i have a giant t and i enter right in
 

2675
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,910
so i have a giant t and i enter right in
the middle

2676
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920
the middle
 

2677
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,670
the middle
now what is what is patri harder to do

2678
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:47,680
now what is what is patri harder to do
 

2679
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,230
now what is what is patri harder to do
here

2680
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:48,240
here
 

2681
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,309
here
well obviously there's like since this

2682
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:50,319
well obviously there's like since this
 

2683
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,589
well obviously there's like since this
graph is a tree there's only so much

2684
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
graph is a tree there's only so much
 

2685
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,549
graph is a tree there's only so much
they can do right they

2686
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:52,559
they can do right they
 

2687
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,870
they can do right they
maybe they they they enter here they

2688
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:54,880
maybe they they they enter here they
 

2689
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,870
maybe they they they enter here they
walk over all the way to the end

2690
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
walk over all the way to the end
 

2691
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,589
walk over all the way to the end
to disenchant the door over here uh and

2692
00:48:59,589 --> 00:48:59,599
to disenchant the door over here uh and
 

2693
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,430
to disenchant the door over here uh and
then they turn around

2694
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:01,440
then they turn around
 

2695
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,630
then they turn around
they walk to the other end they

2696
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:02,640
they walk to the other end they
 

2697
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,470
they walk to the other end they
disenchant that guy

2698
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:04,480
disenchant that guy
 

2699
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,670
disenchant that guy
yep and now they can reach uh other

2700
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:07,680
yep and now they can reach uh other
 

2701
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,670
yep and now they can reach uh other
rooms

2702
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:08,680
rooms
 

2703
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,230
rooms
um yeah because that's their goal is to

2704
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:12,240
um yeah because that's their goal is to
 

2705
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,589
um yeah because that's their goal is to
visit every room sorry i think i skipped

2706
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599
visit every room sorry i think i skipped
 

2707
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,069
visit every room sorry i think i skipped
that step

2708
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:16,079
that step
 

2709
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,349
that step
now there's a few things to notice about

2710
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:17,359
now there's a few things to notice about
 

2711
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,109
now there's a few things to notice about
this example which make it a little bit

2712
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:19,119
this example which make it a little bit
 

2713
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:19,589
this example which make it a little bit
different

2714
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
different
 

2715
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,589
different
from the typical graph theory thing

2716
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:21,599
from the typical graph theory thing
 

2717
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,790
from the typical graph theory thing
which is once

2718
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800
which is once
 

2719
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,030
which is once
they disenchant this door right they

2720
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
they disenchant this door right they
 

2721
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,750
they disenchant this door right they
walk over here and they open it

2722
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
walk over here and they open it
 

2723
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,349
walk over here and they open it
well now they walk over to this other

2724
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:29,359
well now they walk over to this other
 

2725
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,349
well now they walk over to this other
room just to you know it's like

2726
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
room just to you know it's like
 

2727
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,790
room just to you know it's like
you know those gym exercises you like

2728
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:32,800
you know those gym exercises you like
 

2729
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,829
you know those gym exercises you like
run to the other side of the room you

2730
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
run to the other side of the room you
 

2731
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:34,950
run to the other side of the room you
like touch the floor and then you run

2732
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
like touch the floor and then you run
 

2733
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,430
like touch the floor and then you run
back

2734
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,440
back
 

2735
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,549
back
that's kind of what they did here right

2736
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:36,559
that's kind of what they did here right
 

2737
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,630
that's kind of what they did here right
they ran to the this room they tap that

2738
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
they ran to the this room they tap that
 

2739
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,990
they ran to the this room they tap that
vertex and now they want to turn around

2740
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:40,000
vertex and now they want to turn around
 

2741
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,670
vertex and now they want to turn around
and walk to the other side

2742
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
and walk to the other side
 

2743
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,990
and walk to the other side
they don't pay money again on their way

2744
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
they don't pay money again on their way
 

2745
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,390
they don't pay money again on their way
out right so once they open that door

2746
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400
out right so once they open that door
 

2747
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,430
out right so once they open that door
it stays open right and and that's

2748
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:49,440
it stays open right and and that's
 

2749
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,309
it stays open right and and that's
actually quite important

2750
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
actually quite important
 

2751
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,390
actually quite important
um because this uh what it does is it

2752
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:52,400
um because this uh what it does is it
 

2753
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,589
um because this uh what it does is it
makes this problem not look like a

2754
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:53,599
makes this problem not look like a
 

2755
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,790
makes this problem not look like a
traveling salesman problem which

2756
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:54,800
traveling salesman problem which
 

2757
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,309
traveling salesman problem which
wouldn't be so great

2758
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:56,319
wouldn't be so great
 

2759
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,630
wouldn't be so great
um okay so right and moreover

2760
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
um okay so right and moreover
 

2761
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,309
um okay so right and moreover
does the fact that they're like maybe i

2762
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
does the fact that they're like maybe i
 

2763
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,750
does the fact that they're like maybe i
suffered by these edges i have a bunch

2764
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:03,760
suffered by these edges i have a bunch
 

2765
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,549
suffered by these edges i have a bunch
of edges here that are all not enchanted

2766
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:06,559
of edges here that are all not enchanted
 

2767
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,349
of edges here that are all not enchanted
does that matter like if i had like five

2768
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
does that matter like if i had like five
 

2769
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,829
does that matter like if i had like five
billion edges

2770
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:10,839
billion edges
 

2771
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,549
billion edges
here no right because they only ask in

2772
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
here no right because they only ask in
 

2773
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:15,910
here no right because they only ask in
this problem for the minimum

2774
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:15,920
this problem for the minimum
 

2775
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,470
this problem for the minimum
uh number of doors that you have to

2776
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,480
uh number of doors that you have to
 

2777
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,150
uh number of doors that you have to
disenchant

2778
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,160
disenchant
 

2779
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,589
disenchant
yeah so it might be the the harry harry

2780
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599
yeah so it might be the the harry harry
 

2781
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,230
yeah so it might be the the harry harry
harder walks really far along my graph

2782
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
harder walks really far along my graph
 

2783
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,589
harder walks really far along my graph
but as long as they don't walk through

2784
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:27,599
but as long as they don't walk through
 

2785
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,790
but as long as they don't walk through
an enchanted door it costs them nothing

2786
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:30,800
an enchanted door it costs them nothing
 

2787
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,230
an enchanted door it costs them nothing
so what does that mean well that means

2788
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:32,240
so what does that mean well that means
 

2789
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,910
so what does that mean well that means
that like in some sense the second that

2790
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
that like in some sense the second that
 

2791
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,109
that like in some sense the second that
i enter a room

2792
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:35,119
i enter a room
 

2793
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,510
i enter a room
i might as well walk to every other room

2794
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:37,520
i might as well walk to every other room
 

2795
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,790
i might as well walk to every other room
that it's connected to

2796
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,800
that it's connected to
 

2797
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,430
that it's connected to
through unenchanted doors and that

2798
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:41,440
through unenchanted doors and that
 

2799
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,630
through unenchanted doors and that
doesn't cost me anything

2800
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
doesn't cost me anything
 

2801
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,349
doesn't cost me anything
right so sort of as a policy uh i should

2802
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:45,359
right so sort of as a policy uh i should
 

2803
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,230
right so sort of as a policy uh i should
do that right i

2804
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:46,240
do that right i
 

2805
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,910
do that right i
enter a room and then i kind of just

2806
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:47,920
enter a room and then i kind of just
 

2807
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,910
enter a room and then i kind of just
search around and enter every possible

2808
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
search around and enter every possible
 

2809
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,589
search around and enter every possible
door that i can that doesn't cost me an

2810
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
door that i can that doesn't cost me an
 

2811
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,270
door that i can that doesn't cost me an
enchantment

2812
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:53,280
enchantment
 

2813
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,430
enchantment
because those are free and and my goal

2814
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
because those are free and and my goal
 

2815
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,630
because those are free and and my goal
is to visit every room

2816
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:56,640
is to visit every room
 

2817
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,910
is to visit every room
yeah okay so here's going to be the

2818
00:50:59,910 --> 00:50:59,920
yeah okay so here's going to be the
 

2819
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,710
yeah okay so here's going to be the
sneaky trick

2820
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:00,720
sneaky trick
 

2821
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,950
sneaky trick
like what is that starting to smell like

2822
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
like what is that starting to smell like
 

2823
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,710
like what is that starting to smell like
right i open a door and i want to

2824
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:04,720
right i open a door and i want to
 

2825
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,630
right i open a door and i want to
explore all the other rooms that are

2826
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
explore all the other rooms that are
 

2827
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,430
explore all the other rooms that are
that are connected to that one connected

2828
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
that are connected to that one connected
 

2829
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,069
that are connected to that one connected
component

2830
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
component
 

2831
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,150
component
yeah maybe a connected component there's

2832
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,160
yeah maybe a connected component there's
 

2833
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,750
yeah maybe a connected component there's
a problem is it connected component in

2834
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:13,760
a problem is it connected component in
 

2835
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,710
a problem is it connected component in
this graph

2836
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
this graph
 

2837
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,309
this graph
well no like this whole graph is one

2838
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,319
well no like this whole graph is one
 

2839
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,069
well no like this whole graph is one
giant connected component

2840
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:18,079
giant connected component
 

2841
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,510
giant connected component
so the sneaky trick is we're actually

2842
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:19,520
so the sneaky trick is we're actually
 

2843
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,870
so the sneaky trick is we're actually
going to remove the enchanted doors

2844
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:22,880
going to remove the enchanted doors
 

2845
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,549
going to remove the enchanted doors
that was supposed to erase and it didn't

2846
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:24,559
that was supposed to erase and it didn't
 

2847
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,230
that was supposed to erase and it didn't
happen um but

2848
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,240
happen um but
 

2849
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,230
happen um but
the the point is that if we remove the

2850
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,240
the the point is that if we remove the
 

2851
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,670
the the point is that if we remove the
connected doors these are like the

2852
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
connected doors these are like the
 

2853
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,910
connected doors these are like the
chunks of my map that i can visit

2854
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
chunks of my map that i can visit
 

2855
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,069
chunks of my map that i can visit
without incurring any cost

2856
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:34,079
without incurring any cost
 

2857
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,230
without incurring any cost
right so if i think of my graph maybe

2858
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:36,240
right so if i think of my graph maybe
 

2859
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,750
right so if i think of my graph maybe
there's like a bunch of vertices over

2860
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:37,760
there's like a bunch of vertices over
 

2861
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,230
there's like a bunch of vertices over
here

2862
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:38,240
here
 

2863
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,589
here
and then there's an enchanted door and

2864
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:39,599
and then there's an enchanted door and
 

2865
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,430
and then there's an enchanted door and
there's a bunch of vertices over here

2866
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:41,440
there's a bunch of vertices over here
 

2867
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,190
there's a bunch of vertices over here
and then like two more enchanted doors

2868
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,200
and then like two more enchanted doors
 

2869
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,589
and then like two more enchanted doors
like that and like what goes on in here

2870
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:45,599
like that and like what goes on in here
 

2871
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,270
like that and like what goes on in here
like if this is like a giant triangle or

2872
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
like if this is like a giant triangle or
 

2873
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:47,829
like if this is like a giant triangle or
something

2874
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:47,839
something
 

2875
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,190
something
it's actually irrelevant because once i

2876
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:49,200
it's actually irrelevant because once i
 

2877
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,430
it's actually irrelevant because once i
touch any one of these i can now

2878
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
touch any one of these i can now
 

2879
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,750
touch any one of these i can now
touch all the rest of them so that

2880
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:53,760
touch all the rest of them so that
 

2881
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,950
touch all the rest of them so that
suggests an algorithm

2882
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
suggests an algorithm
 

2883
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,549
suggests an algorithm
so our first step is to be

2884
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:58,559
so our first step is to be
 

2885
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,069
so our first step is to be
construct

2886
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079

 

2887
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:09,430

a graph g where the nodes are the rooms

2888
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440

 

2889
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,430

are the rooms

2890
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:13,440

 

2891
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,990

and what should the edges be well if i'm

2892
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,000
and what should the edges be well if i'm
 

2893
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,829
and what should the edges be well if i'm
just trying to find these like little

2894
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:17,839
just trying to find these like little
 

2895
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:18,470
just trying to find these like little
clumps

2896
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,480
clumps
 

2897
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,390
clumps
of rooms that i can visit for free if i

2898
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:20,400
of rooms that i can visit for free if i
 

2899
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,549
of rooms that i can visit for free if i
get to any one of them

2900
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:22,559
get to any one of them
 

2901
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,390
get to any one of them
then the edges

2902
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:26,400

 

2903
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:36,309

are the non-enchanted doors

2904
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:36,319

 

2905
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,349

okay and so now uh

2906
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
okay and so now uh
 

2907
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,790
okay and so now uh
in step two i'm gonna compute my

2908
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
in step two i'm gonna compute my
 

2909
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,910
in step two i'm gonna compute my
number my connected components which we

2910
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:45,920
number my connected components which we
 

2911
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,549
number my connected components which we
covered in lecture

2912
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:48,559
covered in lecture
 

2913
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,430
covered in lecture
uh the connected components of my graph

2914
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,440
uh the connected components of my graph
 

2915
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,190
uh the connected components of my graph
g

2916
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,200
g
 

2917
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,790
g
how much time does that take well

2918
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:54,800
how much time does that take well
 

2919
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,069
how much time does that take well
remember that there are two different

which i should probably rush through
 

2957
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,829

okay so now what do i have i have a list

2960
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
okay so now what do i have i have a list
 

2961
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,790
okay so now what do i have i have a list
of all the connected components in my

making some new graph
 

2979
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,190

that touches every one of these rooms
but that's not quite the right way to go

2990
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,040
but that's not quite the right way to go
 

2991
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,270
but that's not quite the right way to go
uh and and this is what what catches by

2992
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,280
uh and and this is what what catches by
 

2993
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,470
uh and and this is what what catches by
the surprise because this starts

2994
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,480
the surprise because this starts
 

2995
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,750
the surprise because this starts
sounding scary right if you've heard of

2996
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:13,760
sounding scary right if you've heard of
 

2997
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,510
sounding scary right if you've heard of
the traveling salesman problem it like

2998
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:15,520
the traveling salesman problem it like
 

2999
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,870
the traveling salesman problem it like
kind of smells like that

3000
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:16,880
kind of smells like that
 

3001
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,030
kind of smells like that
but that's not actually correct here uh

3002
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,040
but that's not actually correct here uh
 

3003
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,190
but that's not actually correct here uh
for two reasons one is that once i

for two reasons one is that once i
 

3005
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,430
for two reasons one is that once i
open an enchanted door i can go back

3006
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:23,440
open an enchanted door i can go back
 

3007
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,630
open an enchanted door i can go back
through it like i can like

3008
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:24,640
through it like i can like
 

3009
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,990

hopscotch back and forth through that
 

3011
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,510

cost me anything
 

3015
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,069
cost me anything
only cost me something the first time i

only cost me something the first time i

path if you read the problem closely it
 

3029
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,190

just asks for the minimum

number of doors you have to open so this
 

3033
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,670
number of doors you have to open so this
is a really sneaky problem

3034
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:45,680
is a really sneaky problem
 

3035
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,750
is a really sneaky problem
because it turns out there's additional

00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:57,359
you confused and that is

00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,630
you confused and that is
to return this

that seems sneaky why is that well

00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,750
let's say that i walk along remember
that my graph is connected so what i

3062

that my graph is connected so what i

00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,150
that my graph is connected so what i
know

3064
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:18,160
know
 

3065
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,750
know
is that i can always get from any one

3066
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:19,760
is that i can always get from any one
 

3067

is that i can always get from any one
connected component to any other

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,910
as soon as i've done that my death first
search is is done here

3154
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
search is is done here
 

3155
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,390
search is is done here
yeah uh in other words that's the number

3156
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
yeah uh in other words that's the number
 

3157
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,390
yeah uh in other words that's the number
of of nodes in my graph

3158
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
of of nodes in my graph
 

3159
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,030
of of nodes in my graph
so if i took what would be a better way

3160
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
so if i took what would be a better way
 

3161
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,190
so if i took what would be a better way
to to i'm noticing that in my head this

3162
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:53,200
to to i'm noticing that in my head this
 

3163
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,829
to to i'm noticing that in my head this
was easier to articulate than in words

3164
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:56,839
was easier to articulate than in words
 

3165
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,549
was easier to articulate than in words
um

3166
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:58,559
um
 

3167
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,109
um
there'll be a way to do it uh would be

3168
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:01,119
there'll be a way to do it uh would be
 

3169
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,030
there'll be a way to do it uh would be
uh

3170
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:03,040
uh
 

3171
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,789
uh
maybe add some more enchanted doors to

3172
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
maybe add some more enchanted doors to
 

3173
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,630
maybe add some more enchanted doors to
the ground maybe add some more

3174
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:06,640
the ground maybe add some more
 

3175
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,270
the ground maybe add some more
enchantment

3176
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:07,280
enchantment
 

3177
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,630
enchantment
ah that's true actually my problem is a

3178
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
ah that's true actually my problem is a
 

3179
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,870
ah that's true actually my problem is a
little too easy

3180
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:10,880
little too easy
 

3181
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,789
little too easy
so as long as my back my death first

3182
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:12,799
so as long as my back my death first
 

3183
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,470
so as long as my back my death first
search backtracks along the path that's

3184
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,480
search backtracks along the path that's
 

3185
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,349
search backtracks along the path that's
already found

3186
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
already found
 

3187
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,710
already found
then i'm sort of reaching out into this

3188
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
then i'm sort of reaching out into this
 

3189
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,990
then i'm sort of reaching out into this
tentacle and then reaching back and then

3190
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
tentacle and then reaching back and then
 

3191
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,270
tentacle and then reaching back and then
reaching to a new place

3192
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
reaching to a new place
 

3193
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,190
reaching to a new place
i'll never traverse an enchanted door

3194
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,200
i'll never traverse an enchanted door
 

3195
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,470
i'll never traverse an enchanted door
that i don't need to

3196
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,480
that i don't need to
 

3197
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,390
that i don't need to
uh because i've already already seen the

3198
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:24,400
uh because i've already already seen the
 

3199
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,589
uh because i've already already seen the
location

3200
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:25,599
location
 

3201
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,430
location
um is your traversing tree yeah yeah so

3202
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:29,440
um is your traversing tree yeah yeah so
 

3203
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,270
um is your traversing tree yeah yeah so
i've got a shortest path tree that's

3204
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,280
i've got a shortest path tree that's
 

3205
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,109
i've got a shortest path tree that's
going on here actually i guess a breath

3206
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
going on here actually i guess a breath
 

3207
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,870
going on here actually i guess a breath
first search would be a better example

3208
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:34,880
first search would be a better example
 

3209
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,270
first search would be a better example
um in fact here's okay let's be concrete

3210
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:39,280
um in fact here's okay let's be concrete
 

3211
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,309
um in fact here's okay let's be concrete
about i'm sorry

3212
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:40,319
about i'm sorry
 

3213
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:41,349
about i'm sorry
i should have thought about this more

3214
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:41,359
i should have thought about this more
 

3215
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,190
i should have thought about this more
carefully than i did at home yesterday

3216
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
carefully than i did at home yesterday
 

3217
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,829
carefully than i did at home yesterday
um

3218
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:43,839
um
 

3219
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,190
um
one thing i could do would be to compute

3220
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,200
one thing i could do would be to compute
 

3221
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,030
one thing i could do would be to compute
a shortest path tree from one vertex in

3222
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:47,040
a shortest path tree from one vertex in
 

3223
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,990
a shortest path tree from one vertex in
this graph

3224
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:48,000
this graph
 

3225
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,309
this graph
to all the other ones in particular that

3226
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
to all the other ones in particular that
 

3227
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,630
to all the other ones in particular that
gives me the the shortest path

3228
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:52,640
gives me the the shortest path
 

3229
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,710
gives me the the shortest path
and i could traverse that tree to one

3230
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:54,720
and i could traverse that tree to one
 

3231
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,990
and i could traverse that tree to one
node and then turn this

3232
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,000
node and then turn this
 

3233
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,829
node and then turn this
all the way back and then traverse it to

3234
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:57,839
all the way back and then traverse it to
 

3235
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,430
all the way back and then traverse it to
a new node and then traverse it all the

3236
00:57:59,430 --> 00:57:59,440
a new node and then traverse it all the
 

3237
00:57:59,440 --> 00:57:59,910
a new node and then traverse it all the
way back

3238
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
way back
 

3239
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,630
way back
and so on this is not an efficient path

3240
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:02,640
and so on this is not an efficient path
 

3241
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,069
and so on this is not an efficient path
from a walking perspective

3242
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
from a walking perspective
 

3243
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,990
from a walking perspective
but from a door opening perspective it's

3244
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:06,000
but from a door opening perspective it's
 

3245
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,750
but from a door opening perspective it's
extremely efficient because it's a tree

3246
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:07,760
extremely efficient because it's a tree
 

3247
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,630
extremely efficient because it's a tree
right

3248
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
right
 

3249
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,950
right
and remember that the number of edges in

3250
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
and remember that the number of edges in
 

3251
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,470
and remember that the number of edges in
a spanning tree of my graph

3252
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
a spanning tree of my graph
 

3253
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,150
a spanning tree of my graph
is exactly a number of

3254
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
is exactly a number of
 

3255
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,710
is exactly a number of
vertices in my graph minus one which is

3256
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
vertices in my graph minus one which is
 

3257
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,270
vertices in my graph minus one which is
exactly

3258
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,280
exactly
 

3259
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,829
exactly
the property we have here sweating for a

3260
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:21,839
the property we have here sweating for a
 

3261
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,030
the property we have here sweating for a
second there

3262
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
second there
 

3263
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,630
second there
okay so now in our remaining uh 30

3264
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:26,640
okay so now in our remaining uh 30
 

3265
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,430
okay so now in our remaining uh 30
minutes here

3266
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
minutes here
 

3267
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,190
minutes here
we've got two more problems which is

3268
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:29,200
we've got two more problems which is
 

3269
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,870
we've got two more problems which is
more than enough time

3270
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
more than enough time
 

3271
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,549
more than enough time
especially because the last problem is

3272
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:32,559
especially because the last problem is
 

3273
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,870
especially because the last problem is
is largely combinatorial and less

3274
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:34,880
is largely combinatorial and less
 

3275
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,670
is largely combinatorial and less
algorithmic so

3276
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:35,680
algorithmic so
 

3277
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,150
algorithmic so
i think it's okay to focus maybe talk

3278
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
i think it's okay to focus maybe talk
 

3279
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,190
i think it's okay to focus maybe talk
about that at a high level

3280
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
about that at a high level
 

3281
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,750
about that at a high level
um and show a fun plot okay so for

3282
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:41,760
um and show a fun plot okay so for
 

3283
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,789
um and show a fun plot okay so for
problem four

3284
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:42,799
problem four
 

3285
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:46,549
problem four

angle i suppose um which is uh

3298
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
angle i suppose um which is uh
 

3299
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,950
angle i suppose um which is uh
essentially the following which is that

3300
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:06,960
essentially the following which is that

you can book an itinerary

3302
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:08,559
you can book an itinerary
 

3303
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,349
you can book an itinerary
where you have your home city and then

3304
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:11,359
where you have your home city and then
 

3305
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:12,470
where you have your home city and then
you choose i believe

3306
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,480
you choose i believe
 

3307
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,630
you choose i believe
three other cities that you want to

visit
 

3311
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,030
visit
and then purity atlantic um you know

3312
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:19,040
and then purity atlantic um you know
 

3313
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,069
and then purity atlantic um you know
maybe you're on your honeymoon and

3314

maybe you're on your honeymoon and
 

3315
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,670
maybe you're on your honeymoon and
you're not concerned with price

3316

you're not concerned with price
 

3317
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,270
you're not concerned with price
uh but rather just the efficiency

3318
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
uh but rather just the efficiency
 

3319
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,309
uh but rather just the efficiency
because you don't want to spend your

3320
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:24,319
because you don't want to spend your
 

3321
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,069
because you don't want to spend your
whole time in an airplane that's

3322
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:26,079
whole time in an airplane that's
 

3323
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,190
whole time in an airplane that's
particularly true this month uh then

3324
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,200
particularly true this month uh then
 

3325
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,309
particularly true this month uh then
what do you want to do you want to

3326
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:30,319
what do you want to do you want to
 

3327
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:31,670
what do you want to do you want to
minimize your total number of

3328
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
minimize your total number of
 

3329
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,390
minimize your total number of
connections

3330
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,400
connections
 

3331
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,950
connections
right because as we all know in um

3332
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:36,960
right because as we all know in um
 

3333
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,950
right because as we all know in um
spring 2020 we don't want to spend very

3334
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:38,960
spring 2020 we don't want to spend very
 

3335
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,150
spring 2020 we don't want to spend very
much time in airports

3336
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,160
much time in airports
 

3337
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,349
much time in airports
yeah uh so right uh

3338
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:43,359
yeah uh so right uh
 

3339
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,349
yeah uh so right uh
so how do we do that well you know we

3340
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:45,359
so how do we do that well you know we
 

3341
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,109
so how do we do that well you know we
make a website where

3342
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:47,119
make a website where
 

3343
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,270
make a website where
you tell purity atlantic the cities that

3344
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,280
you tell purity atlantic the cities that
 

3345
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,789
you tell purity atlantic the cities that
you want to visit in your home city and

3346
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:50,799
you want to visit in your home city and
 

3347
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:51,750
you want to visit in your home city and
they give you back

3348
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,760
they give you back
 

3349
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,230
they give you back
an efficient itinerary that minimizes

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,390
an efficient itinerary that minimizes
the number of connections

3352

the number of connections
 

3353
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,630
the number of connections
okay and the question uh is how do you

3354
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:58,640
okay and the question uh is how do you
 

3355
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,990
okay and the question uh is how do you
actually do that right

3356
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
actually do that right
 

3357
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,390
actually do that right
how do you um compute the the best

3358
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
how do you um compute the the best
 

3359
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,150
how do you um compute the the best
itinerary uh that minimizes the number

3360
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,160
itinerary uh that minimizes the number
 

3361
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,750
itinerary uh that minimizes the number
of flights you have to take

3362
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:05,760

3363
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,270

so what are our variables and sometimes

3364
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
so what are our variables and sometimes
 

3365
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,549
so what are our variables and sometimes
it feels like the variables are all the

3366
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:08,559
it feels like the variables are all the
 

3367
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,069
it feels like the variables are all the
different permutations of the cities you

3368
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:10,079
different permutations of the cities you
 

3369
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,470
different permutations of the cities you
could visit right i could like go to

3370
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:12,480
could visit right i could like go to
 

3371
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,710
could visit right i could like go to
i don't know cambridge uh boston and

3372
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:14,720
i don't know cambridge uh boston and
 

3373
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,910
i don't know cambridge uh boston and
then cambridge

3374
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:15,920
then cambridge
 

3375
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,510
then cambridge
in the uk maybe you're doing like a

3376
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:17,520
in the uk maybe you're doing like a
 

3377
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,190
in the uk maybe you're doing like a
university thing and then yeah i don't

3378
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
university thing and then yeah i don't
 

3379
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,109
university thing and then yeah i don't
know budapest and some other place or

3380
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:21,119
know budapest and some other place or
 

3381
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,710
know budapest and some other place or
you do those in any other order

3382
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:22,720
you do those in any other order
 

3383
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,710
you do those in any other order
um and that feels like it should be

3384
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:24,720
um and that feels like it should be
 

3385
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,829
um and that feels like it should be
factorial which would be bad

3386
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:26,839

fixed parameter tractable but that's
 

3395
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:38,630
fixed parameter tractable but that's
sort of an overkill

3396
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:38,640
sort of an overkill
 

3397
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,030

easy
um a different way to put it is that uh

3406
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:47,839
um a different way to put it is that uh
 

3407

01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
class so i have city a
 

3417
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,950
class so i have city a
b c i could do b c a i could do b a c

3419
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,069

listen up yeah fine jason

3420
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:08,079
listen up yeah fine jason
 

3421
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,950
listen up yeah fine jason
uh i'll do that so

3422
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:12,960

 

3423
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,470

this is what we call direct proof

3424
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:14,480
this is what we call direct proof
 

3425
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,309
this is what we call direct proof
mathematically uh which are all the

3426
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
mathematically uh which are all the
 

3427
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,510
mathematically uh which are all the
possible ways

3428
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:17,520
possible ways
 

3429

3431
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,589

and now by my direct uh proof i claim

3432
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:31,599
and now by my direct uh proof i claim
 

3433
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,270
and now by my direct uh proof i claim
there are no other ways to visit three

uh and in particular there are one two

3438
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:35,920
uh and in particular there are one two
 

3439
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,230

3453
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,870
total set of cities that you want to
visit as a couple and order them it's

visit as a couple and order them it's
 

3455
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,309
visit as a couple and order them it's
specifically three

3456
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
specifically three
 

3457
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,190
specifically three
you might also notice that six is three

3458
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
you might also notice that six is three
 

3459
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,470
you might also notice that six is three
factorial

3460

3461
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,230
factorial
uh which is perhaps a more efficient way

3462
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240
uh which is perhaps a more efficient way
 

3463
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,789
uh which is perhaps a more efficient way
to get to that same balance

3464
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:00,799
to get to that same balance
 

3465
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,510
to get to that same balance
okay so right so there's there's six

3466
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
okay so right so there's there's six
 

3467
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,349
okay so right so there's there's six

01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,670
from the second one to the third one the
third one back to the first one

3482
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:19,680
third one back to the first one
 

3483
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,029
third one back to the first one
okay so

3484
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:23,039
okay so
 

3485
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,390
okay so
what do i need well i need in some sense

3486
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,400
what do i need well i need in some sense
 

3487
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,750
what do i need well i need in some sense
i want to be conservative about it just

3488
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:27,760
i want to be conservative about it just
 

3489
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,190
i want to be conservative about it just
the cost of flying from

3490
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,200
the cost of flying from
 

3491
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,789
the cost of flying from
every city to every other city but

3492
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:30,799
every city to every other city but
 

3493
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,230
every city to every other city but
that's not quite right

3494
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
that's not quite right
 

3495
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,870
that's not quite right
i only need the cost of flying from

3496
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:34,880
i only need the cost of flying from
 

3497
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,789
i only need the cost of flying from
every city that you have specified as a

3498
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
every city that you have specified as a
 

3499
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,910
every city that you have specified as a
city you're interested in

3500
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
city you're interested in
 

3501
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,510
city you're interested in
to every other city that you specified

3502
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:39,520
to every other city that you specified
 

3503
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,829
to every other city that you specified
that you're interested in yeah

3504
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
that you're interested in yeah
 

3505
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:45,910
that you're interested in yeah
okay so in particular i go to my new one

3506
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:45,920
okay so in particular i go to my new one
 

3507
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,990
okay so in particular i go to my new one
um right so in this problem we have c

3508
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,000
um right so in this problem we have c
 

3509
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,470
um right so in this problem we have c
cities

3510
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:50,480

 

3511
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,029

and f flights

3512
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:55,039

 

3513
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,309

yeah um okay and initially it might

3514
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
yeah um okay and initially it might
 

3515
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,670
yeah um okay and initially it might
seem that we have to compute a ton of

3516
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
seem that we have to compute a ton of
 

3517
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,150
seem that we have to compute a ton of
shortest paths but like if i want to go

3518
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,160
shortest paths but like if i want to go
 

3519
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,309
shortest paths but like if i want to go
from boston to

3520
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
from boston to
 

3521
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:07,029
from boston to
budapest to london to i'm running out of

3522
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:07,039
budapest to london to i'm running out of
 

3523
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,710
budapest to london to i'm running out of
cities paris and back to boston or

3524
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:08,720
cities paris and back to boston or
 

3525
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,309
cities paris and back to boston or
whatever ordering i prefer

3526
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
whatever ordering i prefer
 

3527
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,309
whatever ordering i prefer
do i need to worry about the shortest

3528
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
do i need to worry about the shortest
 

3529
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,510
do i need to worry about the shortest
path

3530
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
path
 

3531
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,430
path
from you know nebraska to california

3532
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:17,440
from you know nebraska to california
 

3533
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,950
from you know nebraska to california
potentially not right like that could be

3534
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
potentially not right like that could be
 

3535
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,710
potentially not right like that could be
relevant the only ones that i care about

3536
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
relevant the only ones that i care about
 

3537
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,069
relevant the only ones that i care about
are those four cities that i've

3538
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
are those four cities that i've
 

3539
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,309
are those four cities that i've
identified okay

3540
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:24,319
identified okay
 

3541
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,390
identified okay
um so there's there's three factorial

3542
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
um so there's there's three factorial
 

3543
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,390
um so there's there's three factorial
possible

3544
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:27,400
possible
 

3545
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,430
possible
permutations at the end of the day

3546
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
permutations at the end of the day
 

3547
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,789
permutations at the end of the day
well there's two times four choose

3548
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
well there's two times four choose
 

3549
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,910
well there's two times four choose
two um if you're wondering this is

3550
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
two um if you're wondering this is
 

3551
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,710
two um if you're wondering this is
12 or big o of one pairs

3552
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:42,720
12 or big o of one pairs
 

3553
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,630
12 or big o of one pairs
of cities um meaning that like

3554
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,640
of cities um meaning that like
 

3555
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,549
of cities um meaning that like
uh uh for

3556
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:50,559
uh uh for
 

3557
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,710
uh uh for
uh itinerary purposes itinerary

3558
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
uh itinerary purposes itinerary
 

3559
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,750
uh itinerary purposes itinerary
okay meaning that uh if i always

3560
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
okay meaning that uh if i always
 

3561
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,789
okay meaning that uh if i always
enter an airport in one of city abc or

3562
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
enter an airport in one of city abc or
 

3563
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:03,750
enter an airport in one of city abc or
my hometown

3564
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:03,760
my hometown
 

3565
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,109
my hometown
and i always exit through another one so

3566
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
and i always exit through another one so
 

3567
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,870
and i always exit through another one so
then there's four possible cities i

3568
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:08,880
then there's four possible cities i
 

3569
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,349
then there's four possible cities i
choose them two at a time

3570
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:11,359
choose them two at a time
 

3571
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,349
choose them two at a time
notice that flights might not be ordered

3572
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
notice that flights might not be ordered
 

3573
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,789
notice that flights might not be ordered
like i might be able to get from one

3574
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:14,799
like i might be able to get from one
 

3575
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,230
like i might be able to get from one
city to another but then maybe the

3576
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,240
city to another but then maybe the
 

3577
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:16,870
city to another but then maybe the
airplane

3578
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:16,880
airplane
 

3579
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,390
airplane
has a connection or something so going

3580
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:18,400
has a connection or something so going
 

3581
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,150
has a connection or something so going
back is a different cost but

3582
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
back is a different cost but
 

3583
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,150
back is a different cost but
totally there's there's two times four

3584
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:22,160
totally there's there's two times four
 

3585
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,390
totally there's there's two times four
choose two uh different pairs of cities

3586
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,400
choose two uh different pairs of cities
 

3587
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,109
choose two uh different pairs of cities
that i could enter

3588
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:25,119
that i could enter
 

3589
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,230
that i could enter
exit from okay

3590
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:28,240
exit from okay
 

3591
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,349
exit from okay
so now what am i going to do well

3592
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359
so now what am i going to do well
 

3593
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:35,270
so now what am i going to do well
so i can compute the 12 different

3594
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:35,280
so i can compute the 12 different
 

3595
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,710
so i can compute the 12 different
shortest paths

3596
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,720
shortest paths
 

3597
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,950
shortest paths
that matter in my my graph so when i say

3598
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
that matter in my my graph so when i say
 

3599
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,630
that matter in my my graph so when i say
shortest path what do i mean

3600
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
shortest path what do i mean
 

3601
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:48,789
shortest path what do i mean
well i'm going to construct a graph

3602
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:48,799

 

3603
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:53,670

g with one vertex

3604
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:53,680

 

3605
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,870

per city right and

3606
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:56,880
per city right and
 

3607
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,670
per city right and
one edge

3608
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:01,680
one edge
 

3609
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,670
one edge
per flight

3610
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680

 

3611
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,990

and notice the the number of connections

3612
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,000
and notice the the number of connections
 

3613
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,029
and notice the the number of connections
that i need to make

3614
01:05:09,029 --> 01:05:09,039
that i need to make
 

3615
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,190
that i need to make
the minimum number between any city and

3616
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
the minimum number between any city and
 

3617
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,870
the minimum number between any city and
any other city

3618
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,880
any other city
 

3619
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,950
any other city
is equal to the shortest path the length

3620
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
is equal to the shortest path the length
 

3621
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,950
is equal to the shortest path the length
of the shortest path minus one

3622
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:16,960
of the shortest path minus one
 

3623
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,950
of the shortest path minus one
right so like maybe i have you know like

3624
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
right so like maybe i have you know like
 

3625
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,309
right so like maybe i have you know like
here's boston

3626
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:20,319
here's boston
 

3627
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:24,789
here's boston
here's london here's paris

3628
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799

 

3629
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:28,069

b l p for short

3630
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:28,079
b l p for short
 

3631
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,069
b l p for short
right then the length of my shortest

3632
01:05:30,069 --> 01:05:30,079
right then the length of my shortest
 

3633
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,190
right then the length of my shortest
path

3634
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
path
 

3635
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,349
path
is two and the number of connections i

3636
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359
is two and the number of connections i
 

3637
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:34,470
is two and the number of connections i
have to make is one because i stopped

3638
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:34,480
have to make is one because i stopped
 

3639
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,270
have to make is one because i stopped
through london

3640
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:35,280
through london
 

3641
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,309
through london
yeah so what am i going to do

3642
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:38,319
yeah so what am i going to do
 

3643
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:44,150
yeah so what am i going to do
well for every pair of cities

3644
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,160

 

3645
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:48,870

um in in this uh oops

3646
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:48,880

 

3647
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,710

no that's okay

01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,069

uh in the set of the source city and the

3650
01:05:56,069 --> 01:05:56,079
uh in the set of the source city and the
 

3651
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:56,789
uh in the set of the source city and the
three

3652
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
three
 

3653
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,029
three

01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
the shortest the length of the shortest
 

3659
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,870
the shortest the length of the shortest
path right so this is the

3660
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
path right so this is the
 

3661
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,230
path right so this is the
minimum number of connections i need to

3662
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,240
minimum number of connections i need to
 

3663

01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:42,880
a little more annoying the number of
 

3697
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,029
a little more annoying the number of
vertices is the number of cities

3698
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:45,039
vertices is the number of cities
 

3699
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,309
vertices is the number of cities
the number of edges the number of

the number of edges the number of
 

3701
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,069
the number of edges the number of
flights right so this takes

3702
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:48,079
flights right so this takes
 

3703
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,270
flights right so this takes
12 times o c plus f

things where we're being sneaky we

3710
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:00,000
things where we're being sneaky we
 

3711
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,630
things where we're being sneaky we
told you that you specifically visit

3712
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:02,640
told you that you specifically visit
 

3713
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,910
told you that you specifically visit
three places

3714
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:03,920
three places
 

3715
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,349
three places
and that's where this number 12 came

3716
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
and that's where this number 12 came
 

3717
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,349
and that's where this number 12 came
from right if we'd said that you wanted

3718
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:07,359
from right if we'd said that you wanted
 

3719
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:07,990
from right if we'd said that you wanted
to visit

3720
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
to visit
 

3721
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,910
to visit
m cities then this would be a very

3722
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:09,920
m cities then this would be a very
 

3723
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,510
m cities then this would be a very
different homework problem

3724
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
different homework problem
 

3725
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,549
different homework problem
this is one of those things you got to

3726
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:12,559
this is one of those things you got to
 

3727
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,710
this is one of those things you got to
remember right where we've given you a

3728
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:14,720
remember right where we've given you a
 

3729
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,430
remember right where we've given you a
few constants and you should use them

3730
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,440
few constants and you should use them
 

3731
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,630
few constants and you should use them
okay so now uh

3732
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
okay so now uh
 

3733
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:27,510
okay so now uh
what can i do i can iterate

3734
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520

 

3735
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,190

over every

3736
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:31,200
over every
 

3737
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,510
over every
permutation of

3738
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,520
permutation of
 

3739
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,870
permutation of
a b c

3740
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:38,880
a b c
 

3741
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,829
a b c
right so this is like saying i go from

3742
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:41,839
right so this is like saying i go from
 

3743
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:42,950
right so this is like saying i go from
my source

3744
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:42,960
my source
 

3745
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,029
my source
to city 1 to city 2 to city 3

3746
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:47,039
to city 1 to city 2 to city 3
 

3747
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,150
to city 1 to city 2 to city 3
back to my source right i

3748
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,160
back to my source right i
 

3749
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,349
back to my source right i
add together

3750
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:53,359

 

3751
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:59,510

and compute the cost

3752
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520

 

3753
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,910

the cost of that trip and remember cost

3754
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
the cost of that trip and remember cost
 

3755
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,510
the cost of that trip and remember cost
in this case is equal to the minimum

3756
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:03,520
in this case is equal to the minimum
 

3757
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,910
in this case is equal to the minimum
number of connections

3758
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:05,920
number of connections
 

3759
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,789
number of connections
and then i return the minimizer

3760
01:08:10,789 --> 01:08:10,799
and then i return the minimizer
 

3761
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,630
and then i return the minimizer
so i say like is it cheaper for me to go

3762
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:12,640
so i say like is it cheaper for me to go
 

3763
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,309
so i say like is it cheaper for me to go

loop over permutations which generally

3768
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:19,359

is frowned upon

3770
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:20,480
is frowned upon
 

3771
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,470
is frowned upon
but in this case because we told you

3772
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:22,480
but in this case because we told you
 

3773
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,070
but in this case because we told you
you're visiting precisely three places

that for loop
 

3779
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:31,189
that for loop
well we actually wrote them all out over

3780
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:31,199
well we actually wrote them all out over
 

3781
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:32,229
well we actually wrote them all out over
here on our board

3782
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:32,239
here on our board
 

3783
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:34,870
here on our board
it's exactly three factorial or six

3784
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:34,880
it's exactly three factorial or six
 

3785
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,669
it's exactly three factorial or six
steps

3786
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:35,679
steps
 

3787
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,749
steps
right three times two times one which is

3788
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:37,759
right three times two times one which is
 

3789
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,110
right three times two times one which is
6.

3790
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,120
6.
 

3791
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,870
6.
okay so right so at the end of the day

3792
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:42,880
okay so right so at the end of the day
 

3793
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,470
okay so right so at the end of the day
this for loop is going to take

3794
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:46,480
this for loop is going to take
 

3795
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,709
this for loop is going to take
well order 6 time

3796
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:50,719
well order 6 time
 

3797
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,269
well order 6 time
which of course uh is just order one so

3798
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:53,279
which of course uh is just order one so
 

3799
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,550
which of course uh is just order one so
it doesn't really contribute to our

3800
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:54,560
it doesn't really contribute to our
 

3801
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,990
it doesn't really contribute to our
runtime at all

3802
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:56,000
runtime at all
 

3803
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,269
runtime at all
and our entire algorithm runs in

3804
01:08:59,269 --> 01:08:59,279
and our entire algorithm runs in
 

3805
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,550
and our entire algorithm runs in
c plus f time okay so uh

3806
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:02,560
c plus f time okay so uh
 

3807
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,749
c plus f time okay so uh
right so this is one of these problems

3808
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:03,759
right so this is one of these problems
 

3809
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,510
right so this is one of these problems
where you're really taking advantage of

3815
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,430
you're visiting
three cities so use it incidentally as a

3816
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:11,440
three cities so use it incidentally as a
 

3817
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,870
three cities so use it incidentally as a
computer science theorist if i said

3818
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:12,880
computer science theorist if i said
 

3819
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,749
computer science theorist if i said
you're visiting exactly 17 cities

3820
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
you're visiting exactly 17 cities
 

3821
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,749
you're visiting exactly 17 cities
well what would be our our numbers now i

3822
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
well what would be our our numbers now i
 

3823
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,669
well what would be our our numbers now i
mean there would be 17 factorial and

3824
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
mean there would be 17 factorial and
 

3825
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:19,990
mean there would be 17 factorial and
then

3826
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:20,000
then
 

3827
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,709
then
like 17 choose 2. those are big numbers

3828
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
like 17 choose 2. those are big numbers
 

3829
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:23,990
like 17 choose 2. those are big numbers
but they're still constants so for

3830
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,000
but they're still constants so for
 

3831
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,590
but they're still constants so for
purposes of this class

3832
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:25,600
purposes of this class
 

3833
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,189
purposes of this class
that would be okay but the second that i

3834
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:27,199
that would be okay but the second that i
 

3835
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:28,870
that would be okay but the second that i
gave it a name like

3836
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:28,880
gave it a name like
 

3837
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,030
gave it a name like
m then i got to think about those

3838
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
m then i got to think about those
 

3839
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,990
m then i got to think about those
factorial

3840
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:32,000
factorial
 

3841
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,110
factorial
things a little more carefully all right

3842
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:35,120
things a little more carefully all right
 

3843
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,590
things a little more carefully all right
um so that's this problem so so the

3844
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:37,600
um so that's this problem so so the
 

3845
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,789
um so that's this problem so so the
basic trick here

3846
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
basic trick here
 

3847
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,189
basic trick here
um was that like yeah it looks like all

3848
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:41,199
um was that like yeah it looks like all
 

3849
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:42,630
um was that like yeah it looks like all
pairs shortest path

3850
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:42,640
pairs shortest path
 

3851
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,789
pairs shortest path
but it's not quite it's all pairs of

3852
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:44,799
but it's not quite it's all pairs of
 

3853
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:45,749
but it's not quite it's all pairs of
things that you're actually going to

3854
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:45,759
things that you're actually going to
 

3855
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,669
things that you're actually going to
travel between shortest path

3856
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
travel between shortest path
 

3857
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,510
travel between shortest path
and since that number of pairs is finite

3858
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:49,520
and since that number of pairs is finite
 

3859
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,590
and since that number of pairs is finite
this is 12 that's that's an okay thing

3860
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
this is 12 that's that's an okay thing
 

3861
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,189
this is 12 that's that's an okay thing
to do

3862
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:53,199
to do
 

3863
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:57,030
to do
okay how are we doing

3864
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:57,040
okay how are we doing
 

3865
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,070
okay how are we doing
about 15 minutes perfect i didn't want

3866
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:00,080
about 15 minutes perfect i didn't want
 

3867
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,350
about 15 minutes perfect i didn't want
to do the last problem and i think i've

3868
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:01,360
to do the last problem and i think i've
 

3869
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,189
to do the last problem and i think i've
managed to

3870
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
managed to
 

3871
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,830
managed to
get myself in exactly that position okay

3872
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:05,840
get myself in exactly that position okay
 

3873
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,229
get myself in exactly that position okay
so

3874
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:06,239
so
 

3875
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,669
so
the very last problem on this homework

3876
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
the very last problem on this homework
 

3877
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,110
the very last problem on this homework
which again this homework really follows

3878
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,120
which again this homework really follows
 

3879
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,350
which again this homework really follows
the prototypical 6006

3880
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360
the prototypical 6006
 

3881
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,110
the prototypical 6006

homework i feel like they all fall into

3884
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
homework i feel like they all fall into
 

3885
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,149
homework i feel like they all fall into
a similar pattern

3886
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:16,159
a similar pattern
 

3887
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:17,750
a similar pattern
again we all these resources are

3888
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:17,760
again we all these resources are
 

3889
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,350
again we all these resources are
available to you guys you should look at

3890
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:19,360
available to you guys you should look at
 

3891
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,550
available to you guys you should look at
them the uh

3892
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:20,560
them the uh
 

3893
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,430
them the uh
you know we're not trying to hide

3894
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:21,440
you know we're not trying to hide
 

3895
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,910
you know we're not trying to hide
anything um this problem involves uh

3896
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:23,920
anything um this problem involves uh
 

3897
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,270
anything um this problem involves uh
solving a pocket cube

3898
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
solving a pocket cube
 

3899
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,870
solving a pocket cube
which is like a little mini rubik's cube

3900
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:26,880
which is like a little mini rubik's cube
 

3901
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,630
which is like a little mini rubik's cube
which is two by two

3902
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:28,640
which is two by two
 

3903
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,350
which is two by two
um and and it looks like this uh

3904
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:33,360

 

3905
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,870

ah there's actually

3906
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:36,880
ah there's actually
 

3907
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,430
ah there's actually
here we go right so here's my rubik's

3908
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:39,440
here we go right so here's my rubik's
 

3909
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,550
here we go right so here's my rubik's
cube

3910
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,560

 

3911
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,270

looks like a cube which i'm having some

3912
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,280
looks like a cube which i'm having some
 

3913
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,550
looks like a cube which i'm having some
trouble drawing

3914
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
trouble drawing
 

3915
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,590
trouble drawing
uh uh and in particular it's two by two

3916
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,600

 

3917
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,590

uh which makes it a little easier than

3918
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:53,600
uh which makes it a little easier than
 

3919
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,510
uh which makes it a little easier than
your typical rubik's cube

3920
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:55,520
your typical rubik's cube
 

3921
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,149
your typical rubik's cube
okay um and in particular we're gonna

3922
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:58,159
okay um and in particular we're gonna
 

3923
01:10:58,159 --> 01:10:58,870
okay um and in particular we're gonna
mark

3924
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:58,880
mark
 

3925
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,030
mark
uh some faces sneakily they used a

3926
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,040
uh some faces sneakily they used a
 

3927
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,110
uh some faces sneakily they used a
little geometry term here which is cute

3928
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:03,120
little geometry term here which is cute
 

3929
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,149
little geometry term here which is cute
so here's face f0 i'm sorry you can't

3930
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
so here's face f0 i'm sorry you can't
 

3931
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,310
so here's face f0 i'm sorry you can't
quite see that but

3932
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,320
quite see that but
 

3933
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,910
quite see that but
the top face is f zero case we were

3934
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,920
the top face is f zero case we were
 

3935
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,110
the top face is f zero case we were
wondering uh the left face

3936
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:13,120
wondering uh the left face
 

3937
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,189
wondering uh the left face
which is f one and the front facing

3938
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:17,199
which is f one and the front facing
 

3939
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,390
which is f one and the front facing
face here f two

3940
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,400
face here f two
 

3941
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,750
face here f two
notice that we've identified these by

3942
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
notice that we've identified these by
 

3943
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,590
notice that we've identified these by
like vectors that point ninety degrees

3944
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:23,600
like vectors that point ninety degrees
 

3945
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,950
like vectors that point ninety degrees
out from the face these are called

3946
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
out from the face these are called
 

3947
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,630
out from the face these are called
normal vectors

3948
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:26,640
normal vectors
 

3949
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,149
normal vectors
if you want to define those rigorously

3950
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:28,159
if you want to define those rigorously
 

3951
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,790
if you want to define those rigorously
you can take my my grad level class

3952
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:30,800
you can take my my grad level class
 

3953
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,310
you can take my my grad level class
but for a rubik's cube it's not terribly

3954
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
but for a rubik's cube it's not terribly
 

3955
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,430
but for a rubik's cube it's not terribly
difficult uh but in any event um

3956
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:35,440
difficult uh but in any event um
 

3957
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,110
difficult uh but in any event um
i can talk about flipping this rubik's

3958
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,120
i can talk about flipping this rubik's
 

3959
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,630
i can talk about flipping this rubik's
cube in a pretty easy way right which is

3960
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:38,640
cube in a pretty easy way right which is
 

3961
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,550
cube in a pretty easy way right which is
that i like i'm gonna

3962
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
that i like i'm gonna
 

3963
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,550
that i like i'm gonna
fix one corner of my cube so this is

3964
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:42,560
fix one corner of my cube so this is
 

3965
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,910
fix one corner of my cube so this is
like the corner that i'm holding onto

3966
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:43,920
like the corner that i'm holding onto
 

3967
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,030
like the corner that i'm holding onto
with my hands

3968
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:45,040
with my hands
 

3969
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,070
with my hands
and now i can grab what the top

3970
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:48,080
and now i can grab what the top
 

3971
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,470
and now i can grab what the top
the side or the front of my cube and i

3972
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:50,480
the side or the front of my cube and i
 

3973
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,590
the side or the front of my cube and i
can rotate it

3974
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:51,600
can rotate it
 

3975
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,750
can rotate it
clockwise or counterclockwise you can

3976
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:53,760
clockwise or counterclockwise you can
 

3977
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,950
clockwise or counterclockwise you can
convince yourself those are all the

3978
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:54,960
convince yourself those are all the
 

3979
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,470
convince yourself those are all the
possible ways that i could uh sort of

3980
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
possible ways that i could uh sort of
 

3981
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,229
possible ways that i could uh sort of
mess with the state of my cube

3982
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
mess with the state of my cube
 

3983
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:01,830
mess with the state of my cube
after fixing one corner okay

3984
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,840
after fixing one corner okay
 

3985
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,070
after fixing one corner okay
uh right and so this problem basically

3986
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,080
uh right and so this problem basically
 

3987
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,110
uh right and so this problem basically
is involving

3988
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,120
is involving
 

3989
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,590
is involving
um sort of a very typical trick in fact

3990
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,600
um sort of a very typical trick in fact
 

3991
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,510
um sort of a very typical trick in fact

01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:26,800
meaning but back in the day ai was all
 

4011
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,750

about like solving

4012
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:27,760
about like solving
 

4013
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,750
about like solving
board games and you know rubik's cubes

4014
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
board games and you know rubik's cubes
 

4015
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,270
board games and you know rubik's cubes
and all these kinds of things

4016
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:31,280
and all these kinds of things
 

4017
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,430
and all these kinds of things
uh using algorithms right and the way

4018
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:33,440
uh using algorithms right and the way
 

4019
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,270
uh using algorithms right and the way
that they would do that is by searching

4020
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
that they would do that is by searching
 

4021
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,270
that they would do that is by searching
the different spaces of configurations

4022
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
the different spaces of configurations
 

4023
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,709
the different spaces of configurations
right so now

4024
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:38,719
right so now
 

4025
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,870
right so now
uh if we think of every face of this

4026
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880
uh if we think of every face of this
 

4027
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,430
uh if we think of every face of this
cube as painted with a color

4028
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
cube as painted with a color
 

4029
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,950
cube as painted with a color
right there are different configurations

4030
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:44,960
right there are different configurations
 

4031
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,630
right there are different configurations
of my graph that i get by like flipping

4032
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
of my graph that i get by like flipping
 

4033
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,149
of my graph that i get by like flipping
the three sides

4034
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
the three sides
 

4035
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,030
the three sides
right so if we think of there being a

4036
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:51,040
right so if we think of there being a
 

4037
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:55,189
right so if we think of there being a
vertex

4038
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:55,199

 

4039
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:59,590

for each state

4040
01:12:59,590 --> 01:12:59,600
for each state
 

4041
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,270
for each state
of my cube where state here means like

4042
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:03,280
of my cube where state here means like
 

4043
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,550
of my cube where state here means like
the coloring of every

4044
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
the coloring of every
 

4045
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,510
the coloring of every
face on my my rabix cube then there's an

4046
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
face on my my rabix cube then there's an
 

4047
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,790
face on my my rabix cube then there's an
edge

4048
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:10,800

 

4049
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,470

for every move

4050
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:14,480
for every move
 

4051
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,870
for every move
and in this problem we encoded a move as

4052
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:16,880
and in this problem we encoded a move as
 

4053
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,590
and in this problem we encoded a move as
a pair j

4054
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:17,600
a pair j
 

4055
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,390
a pair j
comma s where it's saying that i'm going

4056
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
comma s where it's saying that i'm going
 

4057
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,350
comma s where it's saying that i'm going
to

4058
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
to
 

4059
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,709
to
rotate face f

4060
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:24,719
rotate face f
 

4061
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:28,790
rotate face f
j where j is between i get 0 1 and 2

4062
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:28,800
j where j is between i get 0 1 and 2
 

4063
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,990
j where j is between i get 0 1 and 2
in direction s

4064
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000
in direction s
 

4065
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,750
in direction s
and we can just index that as like plus

4066
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:33,760
and we can just index that as like plus
 

4067
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,350
and we can just index that as like plus
or minus one

4068
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
or minus one
 

4069
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,790
or minus one
to kind of say counterclockwise or

4070
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:36,800
to kind of say counterclockwise or
 

4071
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,550
to kind of say counterclockwise or
clockwise right

4072
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:38,560
clockwise right
 

4073
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,149
clockwise right
and so this is kind of a cute thing

4074
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:40,159
and so this is kind of a cute thing
 

4075
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:41,669
and so this is kind of a cute thing
right where your graph

4076
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:41,679
right where your graph
 

4077
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,590
right where your graph
has a bunch of vertices which are all

4078
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
has a bunch of vertices which are all
 

4079
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,630
has a bunch of vertices which are all
rubix cubes

4080
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:46,640
rubix cubes
 

4081
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,590
rubix cubes
that's cube and then their edges if i

4082
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
that's cube and then their edges if i
 

4083
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,270
that's cube and then their edges if i
can get from one to another by doing one

4084
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
can get from one to another by doing one
 

4085
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,870
can get from one to another by doing one
of these moves

4086
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:52,880
of these moves
 

4087
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,550
of these moves
and this is a nice abstraction because

4088
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
and this is a nice abstraction because
 

4089
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,110
and this is a nice abstraction because
if i want to solve a rubik's cube

4090
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
if i want to solve a rubik's cube
 

4091
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,950
if i want to solve a rubik's cube
in the most efficient way possible one

4092
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960
in the most efficient way possible one
 

4093
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,149
in the most efficient way possible one
way to do that is to compute the

4094
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
way to do that is to compute the
 

4095
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,110
way to do that is to compute the
shortest path

4096
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:01,120
shortest path
 

4097
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,709
shortest path
from my current configuration to

4098
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:04,719
from my current configuration to
 

4099
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,669
from my current configuration to
the you know the platonic rubik's cube

4100
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679
the you know the platonic rubik's cube
 

4101
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:08,790
the you know the platonic rubik's cube
right where all the colors

4102
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:08,800
right where all the colors
 

4103
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,550
right where all the colors
are constant on the different uh faces

4104
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:10,560
are constant on the different uh faces
 

4105
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,709
are constant on the different uh faces
of my cube yeah and so that's like a

4106
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:12,719
of my cube yeah and so that's like a
 

4107
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,550
of my cube yeah and so that's like a
sort of basic uh

4108
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:14,560
sort of basic uh
 

4109
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,870
sort of basic uh
identification that happens all over the

4110
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:16,880
identification that happens all over the
 

4111
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,470
identification that happens all over the
place in search strategies

4112
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:18,480
place in search strategies
 

4113
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,990
place in search strategies
where like i'm going to think of every

4114
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:20,000
where like i'm going to think of every
 

4115
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,390
where like i'm going to think of every
vertex of my graph as being the state of

4116
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:22,400
vertex of my graph as being the state of
 

4117
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,270
vertex of my graph as being the state of
some system

4118
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,280
some system
 

4119
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,030
some system
and every edge as being a transition

4120
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,040
and every edge as being a transition
 

4121
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,790
and every edge as being a transition
from one to another

4122
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:26,800
from one to another
 

4123
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,550
from one to another
and then paths in this thing are kind of

4124
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:28,560
and then paths in this thing are kind of
 

4125
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,470
and then paths in this thing are kind of
like different ways of solving my puzzle

4126
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:30,480
like different ways of solving my puzzle
 

4127
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,350
like different ways of solving my puzzle
right so like

4128
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:31,360
right so like
 

4129
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,110
right so like
a different one would be you know i

4130
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
a different one would be you know i
 

4131
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,630
a different one would be you know i
don't know every vertex

4132
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:34,640
don't know every vertex
 

4133
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,110
don't know every vertex
is a chess board with the pieces the

4134
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,120
is a chess board with the pieces the
 

4135
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,950
is a chess board with the pieces the
chess pieces scattered on the chessboard

4136
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:38,960
chess pieces scattered on the chessboard
 

4137
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,189
chess pieces scattered on the chessboard
and every edge is one chess move by one

4138
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:41,199
and every edge is one chess move by one
 

4139
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,630
and every edge is one chess move by one
player or the other

4140
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:42,640
player or the other
 

4141
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,590
player or the other
in that case you have to be a little

4142
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:43,600
in that case you have to be a little
 

4143
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,750
in that case you have to be a little
careful because you want player one or

4144
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:45,760
careful because you want player one or
 

4145
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,110
careful because you want player one or
player two to go back and forth from

4146
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,120
player two to go back and forth from
 

4147
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,070
player two to go back and forth from
each other but i'll let you think about

4148
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,080
each other but i'll let you think about
 

4149
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,070
each other but i'll let you think about
the reduction there

4150
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:50,080
the reduction there
 

4151
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,350
the reduction there
okay so uh right this problem

4152
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:53,360
okay so uh right this problem
 

4153
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,270
okay so uh right this problem
i think largely is mostly just fun like

4154
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:55,280
i think largely is mostly just fun like
 

4155
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,189
i think largely is mostly just fun like
combinatorics rather than algorithms but

4156
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:57,199
combinatorics rather than algorithms but
 

4157
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,470
combinatorics rather than algorithms but
there's a lot of algorithms hiding in

4158
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480
there's a lot of algorithms hiding in
 

4159
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,110
there's a lot of algorithms hiding in
here

4160
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,120
here
 

4161
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,830
here
um so they want you to argue that the

4162
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
um so they want you to argue that the
 

4163
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,669
um so they want you to argue that the
number of distinct configurations of

4164
01:15:03,669 --> 01:15:03,679
number of distinct configurations of
 

4165
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,229
number of distinct configurations of
this rubik's cube this two by two guy

4166
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:06,239
this rubik's cube this two by two guy
 

4167
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,630
this rubik's cube this two by two guy
is less than 12 million this is nice

4168
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
is less than 12 million this is nice
 

4169
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,990
is less than 12 million this is nice
because 12 million is a number that

4170
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:10,000
because 12 million is a number that
 

4171
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,950
because 12 million is a number that
computers can actually

4172
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
computers can actually
 

4173
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,430
computers can actually
cope with um and so there's a pretty

4174
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,440
cope with um and so there's a pretty
 

4175
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,870
cope with um and so there's a pretty
straightforward uh argument there

4176
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:17,880

 

4177
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,750

[Applause]

4178
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:19,760
[Applause]
 

4179
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,470
[Applause]
right uh so in particular um

4180
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,480
right uh so in particular um
 

4181
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,310
right uh so in particular um
here's a cube how many corners are in a

4182
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,320
here's a cube how many corners are in a
 

4183
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,070
here's a cube how many corners are in a
cube

4184
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:30,080
cube
 

4185
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,510

eight thanks i i hid one back here

4186
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
eight thanks i i hid one back here
 

4187
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,950
eight thanks i i hid one back here
in case you're wondering so uh let's say

4188
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:36,960
in case you're wondering so uh let's say
 

4189
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:37,750
in case you're wondering so uh let's say
that i i

4190
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:37,760
that i i
 

4191
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,430
that i i
fix the corner of the cube like we've

4192
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,440
fix the corner of the cube like we've
 

4193
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,270
fix the corner of the cube like we've
done that right then

4194
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:41,280
done that right then
 

4195
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,270
done that right then
every time that i rotate one of the

4196
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,280
every time that i rotate one of the
 

4197
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,870
every time that i rotate one of the
faces of my cube clockwise or

4198
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:44,880
faces of my cube clockwise or
 

4199
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,830
faces of my cube clockwise or
counterclockwise

4200
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
counterclockwise
 

4201
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,430
counterclockwise
i'm essentially like taking one corner

4202
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:47,440
i'm essentially like taking one corner
 

4203
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,630
i'm essentially like taking one corner
of my cube and like sticking it in

4204
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:48,640
of my cube and like sticking it in
 

4205
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,070
of my cube and like sticking it in
another place

4206
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,080
another place
 

4207
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,430
another place
right so in all seven

4208
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:53,440
right so in all seven
 

4209
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:59,910
right so in all seven
corners of my cube can move

4210
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920

 

4211
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,630

and if i'm not worried about like you

4212
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
and if i'm not worried about like you
 

4213
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,910
and if i'm not worried about like you
know it could be that like some of these

4214
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
know it could be that like some of these
 

4215
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,510
know it could be that like some of these
permutations are not actually achievable

4216
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
permutations are not actually achievable
 

4217
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,510
permutations are not actually achievable
by a set of steps like maybe i'd have to

4218
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:07,520
by a set of steps like maybe i'd have to
 

4219
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,870
by a set of steps like maybe i'd have to
break my rubik's cube and glue it back

4220
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
break my rubik's cube and glue it back
 

4221
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,390
break my rubik's cube and glue it back
together

4222
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:10,400
together
 

4223
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,310
together
but if i'm being conservative about it

4224
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
but if i'm being conservative about it
 

4225
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,430
but if i'm being conservative about it
there's of course

4226
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:13,440
there's of course
 

4227
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,470
there's of course
less than or equal to seven factorial

4228
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,480
less than or equal to seven factorial
 

4229
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:23,910
less than or equal to seven factorial
different configurations of the corners

4230
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:23,920

 

4231
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,510

right so in other words every time i

4232
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:25,520
right so in other words every time i
 

4233
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,270
right so in other words every time i
rotate my face one of the corners ends

4234
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:27,280
rotate my face one of the corners ends
 

4235
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,790
rotate my face one of the corners ends
up in a different place

4236
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800
up in a different place
 

4237
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,229
up in a different place
so there's seven factorial different

4238
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:30,239
so there's seven factorial different
 

4239
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:33,830
so there's seven factorial different
ways that that could have happened

4240
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:33,840

 

4241
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,149

okay so that's part of my bound remember

4242
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
okay so that's part of my bound remember
 

4243
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,590
okay so that's part of my bound remember
that i'm trying to bound the total

4244
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:37,600
that i'm trying to bound the total
 

4245
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,910
that i'm trying to bound the total
number of configurations here

4246
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:39,920
number of configurations here
 

4247
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,750
number of configurations here
and essentially what i've done so far is

4248
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:41,760
and essentially what i've done so far is
 

4249
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,149
and essentially what i've done so far is
i've said okay

4250
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159
i've said okay
 

4251
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,950
i've said okay
well there's a bunch of cubes in my 2x2

4252
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960
well there's a bunch of cubes in my 2x2
 

4253
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,390
well there's a bunch of cubes in my 2x2
rubik's cube so i'm gonna

4254
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:48,400
rubik's cube so i'm gonna
 

4255
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,189
rubik's cube so i'm gonna
like unglue this entire cube take just

4256
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:51,199
like unglue this entire cube take just
 

4257
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,310
like unglue this entire cube take just
this corner

4258
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,320
this corner
 

4259
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,149
this corner
and stick it up here and there's like

4260
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159
and stick it up here and there's like
 

4261
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,430
and stick it up here and there's like
seven factorial different ways that i

4262
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
seven factorial different ways that i
 

4263
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,830
seven factorial different ways that i
could do that

4264
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:57,840
could do that
 

4265
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,350
could do that
but i still have to account for the fact

4266
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,360
but i still have to account for the fact
 

4267
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,189
but i still have to account for the fact
that i pull this piece off i stick it in

4268
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:01,199
that i pull this piece off i stick it in
 

4269
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:01,990
that i pull this piece off i stick it in
the top

4270
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:02,000
the top
 

4271
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,590
the top
but i have to figure out his orientation

4272
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:03,600
but i have to figure out his orientation
 

4273
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,590
but i have to figure out his orientation
i can still rotate it

4274
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:05,600
i can still rotate it
 

4275
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,229
i can still rotate it
about this corner and in fact there are

4276
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
about this corner and in fact there are
 

4277
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,750
about this corner and in fact there are
three different ways that i could rotate

4278
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:09,760
three different ways that i could rotate
 

4279
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:09,990
three different ways that i could rotate
it

4280
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
it
 

4281
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,430
it
right you can kind of you can see it

4282
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:11,440
right you can kind of you can see it
 

4283
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,110
right you can kind of you can see it
right one two

4284
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120
right one two
 

4285
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,030
right one two
three yeah so in all

4286
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,040
three yeah so in all
 

4287
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,990
three yeah so in all
so each corner

4288
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,000

 

4289
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,110

can rotate

4290
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:25,120

 

4291
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,630

three ways so

4292
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:28,640
three ways so
 

4293
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,790
three ways so
that means that i have three times seven

4294
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:30,800
that means that i have three times seven
 

4295
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,910
that means that i have three times seven
factorial

4296
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:31,920

one one oh two two four
 

4305
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,630
one one oh two two four
eight oh um the problem asks you to

4306
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:46,640
eight oh um the problem asks you to
 

4307
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,830
eight oh um the problem asks you to
argue that

4308

argue that
 

4309
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,229
argue that
your upper bound is upper bounded by 12

4310
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:50,239
your upper bound is upper bounded by 12
 

4311
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,750
your upper bound is upper bounded by 12
million and indeed

4312
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
million and indeed
 

4313
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,189
million and indeed
it is less than or equal to 12 million

4314
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
it is less than or equal to 12 million
 

4315
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:59,350
it is less than or equal to 12 million
is that three times seven factorial or

4316
01:17:59,350 --> 01:17:59,360
is that three times seven factorial or
 

4317
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,350
is that three times seven factorial or
oh i'm sorry um right because there are

4318
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:01,360
oh i'm sorry um right because there are
 

4319
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,550
oh i'm sorry um right because there are
seven corners

4320
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:02,560
seven corners

um okay right so

4330
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:12,560
um okay right so
 

4331
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,709
um okay right so
uh let's see here really quickly move in

4332
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:14,719
uh let's see here really quickly move in
 

4333
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,870
uh let's see here really quickly move in
here the next problem says

4334
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:16,880
here the next problem says
 

4335
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,870
here the next problem says
state the maximum and minimum degree of

4336
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
state the maximum and minimum degree of
 

4337
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,149
state the maximum and minimum degree of
any vertex in my graph

any vertex in my graph
first of all do i expect vertices to

4340
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:24,400
first of all do i expect vertices to
 

4341
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,070
first of all do i expect vertices to
have different degrees this is kind of a

4342
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:26,080
have different degrees this is kind of a
 

4343
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,149
have different degrees this is kind of a
goofy problem

4344
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:28,159
goofy problem
 

4345
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:31,590
goofy problem
like what would it mean to have a vertex

4346
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
like what would it mean to have a vertex
 

4347
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,030
like what would it mean to have a vertex
the the somehow has

4348
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,040
the the somehow has
 

4349
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,709
the the somehow has
lower degree than another vertex would

4350
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:36,719
lower degree than another vertex would
 

4351
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,149
lower degree than another vertex would
mean that there's some configuration of

4352
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:38,159
mean that there's some configuration of
 

4353
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,030
mean that there's some configuration of
this cube

4354
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
this cube
 

4355
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,790
this cube
for which there are fewer moves that i

4356
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:40,800
for which there are fewer moves that i
 

4357
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,550
for which there are fewer moves that i
could do to change it than a different

4358
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:42,560
could do to change it than a different
 

4359
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,910
could do to change it than a different
configuration of this cube and that's

4360
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:45,920
configuration of this cube and that's
 

4361
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,110
configuration of this cube and that's
like obviously not the case right

4362
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,120
like obviously not the case right
 

4363
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:47,830
like obviously not the case right
because when i

4364
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:47,840
because when i
 

4365
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,070
because when i
when i flip one of the the faces of my

01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:50,080
when i flip one of the the faces of my
 

4367

cube
 

4369
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,709
cube
all i'm doing is i'm moving the colors

4370
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:52,719
all i'm doing is i'm moving the colors
 

4371
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:54,390
all i'm doing is i'm moving the colors
around i haven't like somehow changed

4372
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:54,400
around i haven't like somehow changed
 

4373
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,709
around i haven't like somehow changed
the physics of how rubik's cube works

4374
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
the physics of how rubik's cube works
 

4375
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:00,310
the physics of how rubik's cube works
right and so uh

4376
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,320

 

4377
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,070

i think this was just intended to be

4378
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,080
i think this was just intended to be
 

4379
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:06,830
i think this was just intended to be
annoying by your instructors the the min

4380
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:06,840

 

4381
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,550

4382
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:08,560
degree
 

4383
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,669
degree
is equal to the max degree

4385
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,630

and in fact the degree of every node in

4386
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:16,640
and in fact the degree of every node in
 

4387
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,510
and in fact the degree of every node in
my graph is

4388
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:17,520
my graph is
 

4389
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,270
my graph is
constant here the one thing that's worth

4390
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:21,280
constant here the one thing that's worth
 

4391
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,030
constant here the one thing that's worth
noting here what i haven't argued

4392
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:23,040
noting here what i haven't argued
 

4393
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,870
noting here what i haven't argued
it turns out i think to be true but what

4394
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:24,880
it turns out i think to be true but what
 

4395
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,030
it turns out i think to be true but what
i haven't argued is that like i couldn't

4396
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:27,040
i haven't argued is that like i couldn't
 

4397
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,630
i haven't argued is that like i couldn't
rotate a face and actually end up in the

4398
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:28,640
rotate a face and actually end up in the
 

4399
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,550
rotate a face and actually end up in the
same configuration like maybe for some

4400
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:30,560
same configuration like maybe for some
 

4401
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,510
same configuration like maybe for some
reason i have like

4402
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:31,520
reason i have like
 

4403
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,110
reason i have like
red all the way around the outside so

4404
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
red all the way around the outside so
 

4405
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,270
red all the way around the outside so
when i rotate it nothing changed

4406
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,280
when i rotate it nothing changed
 

4407
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,870
when i rotate it nothing changed
that obviously isn't true but i haven't

4408
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:36,880
that obviously isn't true but i haven't
 

4409
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,790
that obviously isn't true but i haven't
argued it carefully but as long as i

4410
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:38,800
argued it carefully but as long as i
 

4411
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,149
argued it carefully but as long as i
don't worry about my graph being simple

4412
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:40,159
don't worry about my graph being simple
 

4413
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,229
don't worry about my graph being simple
like i'm okay with self loops

4414
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:42,239
like i'm okay with self loops
 

4415
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,550
like i'm okay with self loops
then the degree is certainly uh constant

4416
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:44,560
then the degree is certainly uh constant
 

4417
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,750
then the degree is certainly uh constant
yeah

4418
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:45,760
yeah
 

4419
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,950
yeah
okay and in fact i don't think that can

4420
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:48,960
okay and in fact i don't think that can
 

4421
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,709
okay and in fact i don't think that can
that can happen on a typical rubik's

4422
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:50,719
that can happen on a typical rubik's
 

4423
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,669
that can happen on a typical rubik's
cube well i think the point is to

4424
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:53,679
cube well i think the point is to
 

4425
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,990
cube well i think the point is to
say how what the degree was oh yeah

4426
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,000
say how what the degree was oh yeah
 

4427
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,790
say how what the degree was oh yeah
indeed though

4428
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:56,800
indeed though
 

4429
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,070
indeed though
so we haven't computed the degree but

4430
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,080
so we haven't computed the degree but
 

4431
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,590
so we haven't computed the degree but
we've argued that they're equal to one

4432
01:19:59,590 --> 01:19:59,600
we've argued that they're equal to one
 

4433
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,070
we've argued that they're equal to one
another

4434
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,080
another
 

4435
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,510
another
okay so now we actually have to compute

4436
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:01,520
okay so now we actually have to compute
 

4437
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,149
okay so now we actually have to compute
what that degree is um

4438
01:20:04,149 --> 01:20:04,159
what that degree is um
 

4439
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,430
what that degree is um
and here's how to do it so of course uh

4440
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:07,440
and here's how to do it so of course uh
 

4441
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,189
and here's how to do it so of course uh
well this i think is actually even

4442
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:09,199
well this i think is actually even
 

4443
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,030
well this i think is actually even
easier than than the first part

4444
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,040
easier than than the first part
 

4445
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,229
easier than than the first part
essentially remember we have three

4446
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:12,239
essentially remember we have three
 

4447
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,790
essentially remember we have three
different options for faces that i can

4448
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:14,800
different options for faces that i can
 

4449
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,470
different options for faces that i can
rotate i can work it at the top

4450
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:16,480
rotate i can work it at the top
 

4451
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,830
rotate i can work it at the top
the front or the side here right so

4452
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:19,840
the front or the side here right so
 

4453
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,470
the front or the side here right so
there's

4454
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:20,480
there's
 

4455
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,990
there's
uh three faces

4456
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,000
uh three faces
 

4457
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,350
uh three faces
that we could rotate uh

4458
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,360
that we could rotate uh
 

4459
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,709
that we could rotate uh
okay and how many different ways can i

4460
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:28,719
okay and how many different ways can i
 

4461
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:30,149
okay and how many different ways can i
rotate them i can rotate them

4462
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:30,159
rotate them i can rotate them
 

4463
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,709
rotate them i can rotate them
counterclockwise or clockwise

4464
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:32,719
counterclockwise or clockwise
 

4465
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:34,950
counterclockwise or clockwise
so there's two directions so in all

4466
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:34,960
so there's two directions so in all
 

4467
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,110
so there's two directions so in all
there's degree six for every vertex

4468
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,120
there's degree six for every vertex
 

4469
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,629
there's degree six for every vertex
right there's six different ways

4470
01:20:38,629 --> 01:20:38,639
right there's six different ways
 

4471
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,950
right there's six different ways
um in or out of a vertex here

4472
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:42,960
um in or out of a vertex here
 

4473
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,390
um in or out of a vertex here
okay so the next part of the problem

4474
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,400
okay so the next part of the problem
 

4475
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,709
okay so the next part of the problem
gives you a piece of code

4476
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:46,719
gives you a piece of code
 

4477
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,470
gives you a piece of code
and then does breadth first search on

4478
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480
and then does breadth first search on
 

4479
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,870
and then does breadth first search on
this uh this graph

4480
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:50,880
this uh this graph
 

4481
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,870
this uh this graph
and it's super super slow to give me the

4482
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:52,880
and it's super super slow to give me the
 

4483
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,669
and it's super super slow to give me the
distance to all the other configurations

4484
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:55,679
distance to all the other configurations
 

4485
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,990
distance to all the other configurations
and jason conveniently has run it on his

4486
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
and jason conveniently has run it on his
 

4487
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,270
and jason conveniently has run it on his
laptop here

4488
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,280
laptop here
 

4489
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,070
laptop here
i don't i'm nervous to touch your laptop

4490
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,080
i don't i'm nervous to touch your laptop
 

4491
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:02,629
i don't i'm nervous to touch your laptop
i

4492
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:02,639
i
 

4493
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,390
i
i don't care so much but i don't you

4494
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,400
i don't care so much but i don't you
 

4495
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,550
i don't care so much but i don't you
know i i don't want to infect here

4496
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
know i i don't want to infect here
 

4497
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,830
know i i don't want to infect here
yeah right

4498
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:09,840
yeah right
 

4499
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,830
yeah right
so we have a piece of code that um

4500
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:11,840
so we have a piece of code that um
 

4501
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,030
so we have a piece of code that um
explores the graph of all the

4502
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:13,040
explores the graph of all the
 

4503
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,790
explores the graph of all the
configurations of our cube

4504
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:14,800
configurations of our cube
 

4505
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,790
configurations of our cube
um by breadth first search and then sort

4506
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:16,800
um by breadth first search and then sort
 

4507
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,990
um by breadth first search and then sort
of gives me the

4508
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
of gives me the
 

4509
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,629
of gives me the
shortest path i think from the base cube

4510
01:21:20,629 --> 01:21:20,639
shortest path i think from the base cube
 

4511
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:22,229
shortest path i think from the base cube
uh where all the faces are constant to

4512
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:22,239
uh where all the faces are constant to
 

4513
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:23,430
uh where all the faces are constant to
all the other configurations that are

4514
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
all the other configurations that are
 

4515
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,870
all the other configurations that are
reachable

4516
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:24,880
reachable
 

4517
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,550
reachable
and generates a plot uh

4518
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:28,560
and generates a plot uh
 

4519
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,750
and generates a plot uh
right and so what they ask is to um

4520
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:31,760
right and so what they ask is to um
 

4521
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,950
right and so what they ask is to um
figure out the total number of

4522
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:32,960
figure out the total number of
 

4523
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,189
figure out the total number of
configurations that explores uh one

4524
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199
configurations that explores uh one
 

4525
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,629
configurations that explores uh one
thing that you'll find out

4526
01:21:36,629 --> 01:21:36,639
thing that you'll find out
 

4527
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,990
thing that you'll find out
um center

4528
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:40,000
um center
 

4529
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,350
um center
down uh is that uh it

4530
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:43,360
down uh is that uh it
 

4531
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,350
down uh is that uh it
explores pretty much a third in fact

4532
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360
explores pretty much a third in fact
 

4533
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,950
explores pretty much a third in fact
exactly a third of all the possible

4534
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:46,960
exactly a third of all the possible
 

4535
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,870
exactly a third of all the possible
configurations of my cube

4536
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:48,880
configurations of my cube
 

4537
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,910
configurations of my cube
i think we can see that here

4538
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:51,920
i think we can see that here
 

4539
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,590
i think we can see that here
um so i guess uh it runs this whole

4540
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:53,600
um so i guess uh it runs this whole
 

4541
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,950
um so i guess uh it runs this whole
thing you sell them all together

4542
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:54,960
thing you sell them all together
 

4543
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:02,149
thing you sell them all together
um right oops

4544
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:02,159

 

4545
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,550

that's okay um and so in fact uh the

4546
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
that's okay um and so in fact uh the
 

4547
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,910
that's okay um and so in fact uh the
kind of fun fact that you can learn

4548
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:05,920
kind of fun fact that you can learn
 

4549
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,709
kind of fun fact that you can learn
about the two by two by two rubik's cube

4550
01:22:08,709 --> 01:22:08,719
about the two by two by two rubik's cube
 

4551
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,550
about the two by two by two rubik's cube
is that uh there's actually three

4552
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
is that uh there's actually three
 

4553
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,750
is that uh there's actually three
connected components

4554
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:11,760
connected components
 

4555
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,669
connected components
in this graph so in other words there's

4556
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:13,679
in this graph so in other words there's
 

4557
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:14,790
in this graph so in other words there's
sort of like

4558
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:14,800
sort of like
 

4559
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,390
sort of like
three different rubik's cubes you can

4560
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,400
three different rubik's cubes you can
 

4561
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,390
three different rubik's cubes you can
make modulo all the different flips that

4562
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:18,400
make modulo all the different flips that
 

4563
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,910
make modulo all the different flips that
you can do to the uh

4564
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:19,920
you can do to the uh
 

4565
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,669
you can do to the uh
to the faces and those correspond to

4566
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
to the faces and those correspond to
 

4567
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,510
to the faces and those correspond to
three corner rotations of one of the

4568
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:23,520
three corner rotations of one of the
 

4569
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,910
three corner rotations of one of the
corners of the thing

4570
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
corners of the thing
 

4571
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,149
corners of the thing
okay so uh

4572
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:30,159

 

4573
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,390

right so then the the next part of the

4574
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:32,400
right so then the the next part of the
 

4575
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,149
right so then the the next part of the
problem asks you to state the maximum

4576
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:34,159
problem asks you to state the maximum
 

4577
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,310
problem asks you to state the maximum
number of moves needed to

4578
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:36,320
number of moves needed to
 

4579
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,669
number of moves needed to
solve any rubik's cube and you can see

4580
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:37,679
solve any rubik's cube and you can see
 

4581
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:38,950
solve any rubik's cube and you can see
it in this plot so what this plot is

4582
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
it in this plot so what this plot is
 

4583
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:39,669
it in this plot so what this plot is
showing you

4584
01:22:39,669 --> 01:22:39,679
showing you
 

4585
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:41,830
showing you
is the size of the level set of this uh

4586
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:41,840
is the size of the level set of this uh
 

4587
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:42,870
is the size of the level set of this uh
this distance uh

4588
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:42,880
this distance uh
 

4589
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,149
this distance uh
function for for every distance so

4590
01:22:46,149 --> 01:22:46,159
function for for every distance so
 

4591
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:47,669
function for for every distance so
i think technically it looks like zero

4592
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
i think technically it looks like zero
 

4593
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,990
i think technically it looks like zero
but it's actually this is at a one here

4594
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,000
but it's actually this is at a one here
 

4595
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,990
but it's actually this is at a one here
we just say there's one uh vertex at

4596
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
we just say there's one uh vertex at
 

4597
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,229
we just say there's one uh vertex at
distance zero which is the source

4598
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
distance zero which is the source
 

4599
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,750
distance zero which is the source
right and as we move farther and farther

4600
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:55,760
right and as we move farther and farther
 

4601
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,590
right and as we move farther and farther
out our tree is expanding and we're

4602
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:57,600
out our tree is expanding and we're
 

4603
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,350
out our tree is expanding and we're
seeing more and more vertices

4604
01:22:59,350 --> 01:22:59,360
seeing more and more vertices
 

4605
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,870
seeing more and more vertices
apparently most vertices are

4606
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:00,880
apparently most vertices are
 

4607
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,629
apparently most vertices are
approximately distance what is that 11

4608
01:23:02,629 --> 01:23:02,639
approximately distance what is that 11
 

4609
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:03,189
approximately distance what is that 11
or 12

4610
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
or 12
 

4611
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:06,310

uh 11 away from the original
 

4613
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,750
uh 11 away from the original
then eventually i explore the entire

4614
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:07,760
then eventually i explore the entire
 

4615
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,669
then eventually i explore the entire

the farthest away vertex

4618
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:11,840
the farthest away vertex
 

4619
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,110
the farthest away vertex
is 14 away meaning that the most

4620
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:15,120
is 14 away meaning that the most
 

4621
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,110

01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,950
the three by three by three but i have
no idea what it is

4636
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:28,960
no idea what it is
 

4637
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,709
no idea what it is
um i'm impressed if he can calculate in

4638
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:30,719
um i'm impressed if he can calculate in
 

4639
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:31,910
um i'm impressed if he can calculate in
his head like he looks like he was about

4640
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:31,920
his head like he looks like he was about
 

4641
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:32,950
his head like he looks like he was about
to try

4642
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:32,960
to try
 

4643
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,470
to try
uh but i digress uh right so in other

4644
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
uh but i digress uh right so in other
 

4645
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,470
uh but i digress uh right so in other
words um this is actually a fancy term

4646
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:38,480
words um this is actually a fancy term
 

4647
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,950
words um this is actually a fancy term
for uh uh you know we talked about the

4648
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:40,960
for uh uh you know we talked about the
 

4649
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,229
for uh uh you know we talked about the
radius of your graph in the first

4650
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:42,239
radius of your graph in the first
 

4651
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:43,830
radius of your graph in the first
problem now we've got the diameter which

4652
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:43,840
problem now we've got the diameter which
 

4653
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,430
problem now we've got the diameter which
is

4654
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:45,440
is
 

4655
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,870
is
well not necessarily two times the

4656
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:46,880
well not necessarily two times the
 

4657
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,229
well not necessarily two times the
radius the way that we've defined it

4658
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:48,239
radius the way that we've defined it
 

4659
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,229
radius the way that we've defined it
here but but actually

4660
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:50,239
here but but actually
 

4661
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,870
here but but actually
almost um uh i think within some

4662
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:52,880
almost um uh i think within some
 

4663
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,110
almost um uh i think within some
constant of that

4664
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,120
constant of that
 

4665
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,470
constant of that
okay so uh right so

4666
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
okay so uh right so
 

4667
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,310
okay so uh right so
notice that the vertical axis here is

4668
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:00,320
notice that the vertical axis here is
 

4669
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,510
notice that the vertical axis here is
really big

4670
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:01,520
really big
 

4671
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,430
really big
and this is explaining why this bfs code

4672
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:03,440
and this is explaining why this bfs code
 

4673
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,110
and this is explaining why this bfs code
is so slow right because these are

4674
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,120
is so slow right because these are
 

4675
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,550
is so slow right because these are
all the different configurations it has

4676
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
all the different configurations it has
 

4677
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,030
all the different configurations it has
to hit um or more accurately if i take

4678
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,040
to hit um or more accurately if i take
 

4679
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,990
to hit um or more accurately if i take
the y

4680
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:10,000
the y
 

4681
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,390
the y
position of each one of these vertices

4682
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:12,400
position of each one of these vertices
 

4683
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,149
position of each one of these vertices
and sum up its height those are all the

4684
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:14,159
and sum up its height those are all the
 

4685
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:16,070
and sum up its height those are all the
configurations that are reachable

4686
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
configurations that are reachable
 

4687
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,510
configurations that are reachable
and those are all the steps that bfs

4688
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
and those are all the steps that bfs
 

4689
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,910
and those are all the steps that bfs
needs before it's done right and so that

4690
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:19,920
needs before it's done right and so that
 

4691
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,030
needs before it's done right and so that
number is in the

4692
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:21,040
number is in the
 

4693
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,030
number is in the
[Music]

4694
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
[Music]
 

4695
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,149
[Music]
certainly in the millions yeah okay so

4696
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159
certainly in the millions yeah okay so
 

4697
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,910
certainly in the millions yeah okay so
then the last part of this problem which

4698
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:27,920
then the last part of this problem which
 

4699
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,229
then the last part of this problem which
it

4700
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
it
 

4701
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:29,990
it
conveniently looks like i'm low on time

4702
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:30,000
conveniently looks like i'm low on time
 

4703
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,390
conveniently looks like i'm low on time
to solve but i'll refer you to the

4704
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:32,400
to solve but i'll refer you to the
 

4705
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,149
to solve but i'll refer you to the
solution anyway

4706
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:34,159
solution anyway
 

4707
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:37,350
solution anyway
is asking how we might do this faster

4708
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:37,360
is asking how we might do this faster
 

4709
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,110
is asking how we might do this faster
and so in particular what it says is uh

4710
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:41,120
and so in particular what it says is uh
 

4711
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,110
and so in particular what it says is uh
let's say that i have a total of n

4712
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,120
let's say that i have a total of n
 

4713
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,310
let's say that i have a total of n

for my rubik's cube in this case it

4716
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:46,080
for my rubik's cube in this case it
 

4717
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,910
for my rubik's cube in this case it
turns out that that's like roughly 3

4718
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:47,920
turns out that that's like roughly 3
 

4719
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,669
turns out that that's like roughly 3
million i think

4720
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:49,679
million i think
 

4721
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,990
million i think
okay and now i want an algorithm

4722
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,000
okay and now i want an algorithm
 

4723
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,870
okay and now i want an algorithm
that gives me the shortest sequence of

4724
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
that gives me the shortest sequence of
 

4725
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,310
that gives me the shortest sequence of
moves to solve any pocket cube

4726
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:00,320
moves to solve any pocket cube
 

4727
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,510

man i'm really ravaging the chalk today

4728
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
man i'm really ravaging the chalk today
 

4729
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,030
man i'm really ravaging the chalk today
um and i want to solve any cube uh

4730
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,040
um and i want to solve any cube uh
 

4731
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:11,110
um and i want to solve any cube uh
in a number of steps that looks like

4732
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:11,120
in a number of steps that looks like
 

4733
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,550
in a number of steps that looks like
to n to the ceiling

4734
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
to n to the ceiling
 

4735
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,590
to n to the ceiling
of w over two uh

4736
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:17,600
of w over two uh
 

4737
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:23,430
of w over two uh
where um

4738
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:23,440

 

4739
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,910

let's see here the code provides sorry

4740
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:25,920
let's see here the code provides sorry
 

4741
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,189
let's see here the code provides sorry
this problem changed on me this

4742
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:27,199
this problem changed on me this
 

4743
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:30,070
this problem changed on me this
afternoon

4744
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,080

 

4745
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,270

right so uh where n sub i is

4746
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,280
right so uh where n sub i is
 

4747
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,550
right so uh where n sub i is
equal to the uh number of configurations

4748
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,560
equal to the uh number of configurations
 

4749
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,870
equal to the uh number of configurations
reachable within imoves

4750
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:38,880
reachable within imoves
 

4751
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:46,390
reachable within imoves
oh good i see what we did here

4752
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:46,400

 

4753
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,470

right so like if this is my base cube

4754
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:48,480
right so like if this is my base cube
 

4755
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,310
right so like if this is my base cube
then we've got like maybe

4756
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,320
then we've got like maybe
 

4757
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,270
then we've got like maybe
like a six different one two three four

4758
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:53,280
like a six different one two three four
 

4759
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,070
like a six different one two three four
five

4760
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,080
five
 

4761
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,590
five
six different cubes that i can reach

4762
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:55,600
six different cubes that i can reach
 

4763
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,270
six different cubes that i can reach
from those and then there's six cubes i

4764
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,280
from those and then there's six cubes i
 

4765
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,390
from those and then there's six cubes i
can reach from all of those

4766
01:25:58,390 --> 01:25:58,400
can reach from all of those
 

4767
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,669
can reach from all of those
but of course some of those might be

4768
01:25:59,669 --> 01:25:59,679
but of course some of those might be
 

4769
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:03,110
but of course some of those might be
pointing backward um or to each other

4770
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:03,120
pointing backward um or to each other
 

4771
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,310
pointing backward um or to each other
but this is the number of things that

4772
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:04,320
but this is the number of things that
 

4773
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,470
but this is the number of things that
are reachable in eye moves and they ask

4774
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:06,480
are reachable in eye moves and they ask
 

4775
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,229
are reachable in eye moves and they ask
for an algorithm that finds the shortest

4776
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:08,239
for an algorithm that finds the shortest
 

4777
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:09,189
for an algorithm that finds the shortest

4784
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:14,639
subscript there
 

4785
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,669
subscript there
this looks innocent but it's not um

4786
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:17,679
this looks innocent but it's not um
 

4787
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,709
this looks innocent but it's not um
the basic trick here uh is to do

4788
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:20,719
the basic trick here uh is to do
 

4789
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:21,910
the basic trick here uh is to do
i'm not gonna bother writing it down

4790
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:21,920
i'm not gonna bother writing it down
 

4791
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,030
i'm not gonna bother writing it down
we'll just talk about it for a second

4792
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,040
we'll just talk about it for a second
 

4793
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,390
we'll just talk about it for a second
and call it for the day

4794
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,400
and call it for the day
 

4795
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,669
and call it for the day
no i'll draw a picture so the breadth

4796
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:27,679
no i'll draw a picture so the breadth
 

4797
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:28,790
no i'll draw a picture so the breadth

01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,750
first search algorithm that we've
thought about so far

4800
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760
thought about so far
 

4801
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,310
thought about so far
chooses a vertex and then computes level

4802
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,320
chooses a vertex and then computes level
 

4803
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,430
chooses a vertex and then computes level
sets

4804
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:33,440
sets
 

4805
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,709
sets
outward from that vertex until it maybe

4806
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:36,719
outward from that vertex until it maybe
 

4807
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,070
outward from that vertex until it maybe
reaches

4808
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,080
reaches
 

4809
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,510
reaches
the destination uh that you want to hit

4810
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:41,520
the destination uh that you want to hit
 

4811
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,110
the destination uh that you want to hit
that doesn't quite work here and the

4812
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:43,120
that doesn't quite work here and the
 

4813
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,310
that doesn't quite work here and the
well i mean it does work but it's going

4814
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:44,320
well i mean it does work but it's going
 

4815
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,510
well i mean it does work but it's going
to be quite slow

4816
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:45,520
to be quite slow
 

4817
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,950
to be quite slow
because like let's say i had bad luck

4818
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:46,960
because like let's say i had bad luck
 

4819
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,430
because like let's say i had bad luck
and i were in that 14 vertex

4820
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:49,440
and i were in that 14 vertex
 

4821
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,110
and i were in that 14 vertex
right then somewhere in there i'm going

4822
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:51,120
right then somewhere in there i'm going
 

4823
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,950
right then somewhere in there i'm going
to hit this big height

4824
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:52,960
to hit this big height
 

4825
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,830
to hit this big height
which is sitting over the 11 before i

4826
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:55,840
which is sitting over the 11 before i
 

4827
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:56,629
which is sitting over the 11 before i
can get to

4828
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:56,639
can get to
 

4829
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:00,790
can get to
vertex 14. so the trick here is it turns

4830
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
vertex 14. so the trick here is it turns
 

4831
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,149
vertex 14. so the trick here is it turns
out that i can do it by only ever

4832
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159
out that i can do it by only ever
 

4833
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,709
out that i can do it by only ever
getting to 7. and the way that i'm gonna

4834
01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:04,719
getting to 7. and the way that i'm gonna
 

4835
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:05,910
getting to 7. and the way that i'm gonna
do that

4836
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
do that
 

4837
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,510
do that
is instead i'm gonna run bfs

4838
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:09,520
is instead i'm gonna run bfs
 

4839
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,189
is instead i'm gonna run bfs
sort of in parallel for two different

4840
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:11,199
sort of in parallel for two different
 

4841
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:12,790
sort of in parallel for two different
vertices right the source and the target

4842
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:12,800
vertices right the source and the target
 

4843
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,310
vertices right the source and the target
so in this case my

4844
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:14,320
so in this case my
 

4845
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,149
so in this case my
current cube and the cube i would like

4846
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:16,159
current cube and the cube i would like
 

4847
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,510
current cube and the cube i would like
it to be like the solution to the

4848
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:17,520
it to be like the solution to the
 

4849
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,149
it to be like the solution to the
problem

4850
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:18,159
problem
 

4851
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:20,149
problem
i'm first going to compute the level set

4852
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:20,159
i'm first going to compute the level set
 

4853
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,510
i'm first going to compute the level set
one of that cube

4854
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:21,520
one of that cube
 

4855
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,430
one of that cube
then level set one of the next cube

4856
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:23,440
then level set one of the next cube
 

4857
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,709
then level set one of the next cube
level set two

4858
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:24,719
level set two
 

4859
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,750
level set two
level set two three three and notice

4860
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:27,760
level set two three three and notice
 

4861
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,790
level set two three three and notice
that eventually they're going to

4862
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:28,800
that eventually they're going to
 

4863
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,830
that eventually they're going to
intersect pretty much right at the

4864
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:30,840
intersect pretty much right at the
 

4865
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,229
intersect pretty much right at the
midpoint

4866
01:27:32,229 --> 01:27:32,239
midpoint
 

4867
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,550
midpoint
and so the size of the level set i never

4868
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
and so the size of the level set i never
 

4869
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,750
and so the size of the level set i never
need to compute a level set that's

4870
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:35,760
need to compute a level set that's
 

4871
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,990
need to compute a level set that's
bigger than a half of the shortest path

4872
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,000
bigger than a half of the shortest path
 

4873
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,830
bigger than a half of the shortest path
uh length i have to round up to be

4874
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
uh length i have to round up to be
 

4875
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,430
uh length i have to round up to be
conservative about that

4876
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
conservative about that
 

4877
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,110
conservative about that
and and that's where i get this factor

4878
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:43,120
and and that's where i get this factor
 

4879
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,709
and and that's where i get this factor
here so this is a nice little trick for

4880
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719
here so this is a nice little trick for
 

4881
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:46,790
here so this is a nice little trick for
for reducing the search size

4882
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:46,800
for reducing the search size
 

4883
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,149
for reducing the search size
this is another kind of standard trick

4884
01:27:48,149 --> 01:27:48,159
this is another kind of standard trick
 

4885
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:49,830
this is another kind of standard trick
if you look at some of the uh code

4886
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:49,840
if you look at some of the uh code
 

4887
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,590
if you look at some of the uh code
people use for for solving board games

4888
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:51,600
people use for for solving board games
 

4889
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,110
people use for for solving board games
algorithmically and so on i think they

4890
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:53,120
algorithmically and so on i think they
 

4891
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:53,990
algorithmically and so on i think they
typically

4892
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:54,000
typically
 

4893
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,830
typically
uh sort of search from the beginning and

4894
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
uh sort of search from the beginning and
 

4895
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,110
uh sort of search from the beginning and
end state outward to

exponential growth uh as we all know can

4902
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:03,360
exponential growth uh as we all know can
 

4903
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:03,750
exponential growth uh as we all know can
be

4904
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:03,760
be
 

4905
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,709
be
quite problematic all right folks so i

4906
01:28:06,709 --> 01:28:06,719
quite problematic all right folks so i
 

4907
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:07,910
quite problematic all right folks so i
think we're just about out of time and

4908
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:07,920
think we're just about out of time and
 

4909
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,430
think we're just about out of time and
i've certainly worn myself out

4910
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:09,440
i've certainly worn myself out
 

4911
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,750
i've certainly worn myself out
uh so with that hopefully we'll see you

4912
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
uh so with that hopefully we'll see you
 

4913
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,270
uh so with that hopefully we'll see you
next week and uh

4914
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:13,280
next week and uh
 

4915
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:22,639
next week and uh
yeah i hope everybody's doing well
