10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
next week. Okay. So, what is this quiz
 

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,509
next week. Okay. So, what is this quiz
about? It's about what we've talked

12
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
about? It's about what we've talked
 

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,429
about? It's about what we've talked
about so far in this class, of course.

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
about so far in this class, of course.
 

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,589
about so far in this class, of course.

What is this class about? Someone
 

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,470
What is this class about? Someone
remember from my first lecture? What is

18
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
remember from my first lecture? What is
 

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,990
remember from my first lecture? What is
this class about? What are we trying to

20
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
this class about? What are we trying to
 

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,229
this class about? What are we trying to
test you in this class? Algorithms.

22
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
test you in this class? Algorithms.
 

23
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,389
test you in this class? Algorithms.
Algorithms. Great. Also, data

24
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
Algorithms. Great. Also, data
 

25
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,830
Algorithms. Great. Also, data
structures, right? That's what the first

26
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
structures, right? That's what the first
 

27
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,310
structures, right? That's what the first
part of this is. But really, it's to get

28
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
part of this is. But really, it's to get
 

29
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,910
part of this is. But really, it's to get
you to solve computational problems.

30
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
you to solve computational problems.
 

31
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,630
you to solve computational problems.
That's the first thing. Be able to argue

32
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
That's the first thing. Be able to argue
 

33
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,270
That's the first thing. Be able to argue
to someone else that that you actually

34
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
to someone else that that you actually
 

35
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,350
to someone else that that you actually
did solve it, right? It's correct,

36
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
did solve it, right? It's correct,
 

37
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,110
did solve it, right? It's correct,
right? That you chose something that's

38
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
right? That you chose something that's
 

39
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,389
right? That you chose something that's
better than other things, that it's

40
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
better than other things, that it's
 

41
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,470
better than other things, that it's
efficient, right? and that you can

42
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
efficient, right? and that you can
 

43
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,750
efficient, right? and that you can
communicate those things to other

44
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
communicate those things to other
 

45
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,910
communicate those things to other
people, right? Those are my big four

46
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
people, right? Those are my big four
 

47
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,149
people, right? Those are my big four
that I try to get you guys to

48
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
that I try to get you guys to
 

49
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,830
that I try to get you guys to
internalize. And so that's what our

50
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
internalize. And so that's what our
 

51
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,149
internalize. And so that's what our
quizzes are going to try to evaluate you

52
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
quizzes are going to try to evaluate you
 

53
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,469
quizzes are going to try to evaluate you
on. Okay? And so, uh, aside from kind of

54
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
on. Okay? And so, uh, aside from kind of
 

55
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,270
on. Okay? And so, uh, aside from kind of
some mechan this nitty-gritty kind of

56
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
some mechan this nitty-gritty kind of
 

57
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,630
some mechan this nitty-gritty kind of
stuff that we do at the beginning of the

58
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
stuff that we do at the beginning of the
 

59
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,590
stuff that we do at the beginning of the
term like, uh, talking about our model

60
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
term like, uh, talking about our model
 

61
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,670
term like, uh, talking about our model
of computation, right? our model and

62
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
of computation, right? our model and
 

63
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,270
of computation, right? our model and
like asytoics

64
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
like asytoics
 

65
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,429
like asytoics
as

66
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
as
 

67
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,429
as
simpics.

68
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
simpics.
 

69
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,350
simpics.
Is that right?

70
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
Is that right?
 

71
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,429
Is that right?
Uh recurrences, right?

72
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
Uh recurrences, right?
 

73
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,830
Uh recurrences, right?
Aside from these kind of basics, we kind

74
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
Aside from these kind of basics, we kind
 

75
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,870
Aside from these kind of basics, we kind
of delve straight into algorithms,

76
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
of delve straight into algorithms,
 

77
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,789
of delve straight into algorithms,
right? Uh these are kind of like uh you

78
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
right? Uh these are kind of like uh you
 

79
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,550
right? Uh these are kind of like uh you
know almost definitions. We don't rely

80
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
know almost definitions. We don't rely
 

81
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,469
know almost definitions. We don't rely
on these things very much. I mean we

82
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
on these things very much. I mean we
 

83
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,469
on these things very much. I mean we
rely on these things all the time but

84
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
rely on these things all the time but
 

85
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,069
rely on these things all the time but
it's kind of the mathematics that we use

86
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
it's kind of the mathematics that we use
 

87
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,910
it's kind of the mathematics that we use
to talk about things right we how can we

88
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
to talk about things right we how can we
 

89
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,590
to talk about things right we how can we
even say how long this stuff takes

90
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
even say how long this stuff takes
 

91
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,670
even say how long this stuff takes
unless we can reason we can abstract

92
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
unless we can reason we can abstract
 

93
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,990
unless we can reason we can abstract
away that this stuff is not on a real

94
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
away that this stuff is not on a real
 

95
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,230
away that this stuff is not on a real
computer this is kind of in our minds in

96
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
computer this is kind of in our minds in
 

97
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,510
computer this is kind of in our minds in
a computer and we're reasoning about

98
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520
a computer and we're reasoning about
 

99
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,510
a computer and we're reasoning about
these things based on the number of

100
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
these things based on the number of
 

101
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,150
these things based on the number of
constant time operations this magical

102
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
constant time operations this magical
 

103
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,309
constant time operations this magical
computer might have so that you know

104
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
computer might have so that you know
 

105
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,830
computer might have so that you know
which is a pretty good representation of

106
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
which is a pretty good representation of
 

107
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,309
which is a pretty good representation of
any of the computers you have right for

108
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
any of the computers you have right for
 

109
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,830
any of the computers you have right for
certain assumptions right we're not

110
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
certain assumptions right we're not
 

111
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,190
certain assumptions right we're not
going I mean there's not a lot of

112
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
going I mean there's not a lot of
 

113
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,589
going I mean there's not a lot of
problems set questions. We had you talk

114
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
problems set questions. We had you talk
 

115
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,350
problems set questions. We had you talk
about

116
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
about
 

117
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,030
about
uh these things like specifically

118
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
uh these things like specifically
 

119
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,550
uh these things like specifically
usually they were part of some other

120
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
usually they were part of some other
 

121
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,830
usually they were part of some other
problem, right? You you had to describe

122
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
problem, right? You you had to describe
 

123
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,350
problem, right? You you had to describe
the running time of this thing and you

124
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
the running time of this thing and you
 

125
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,350
the running time of this thing and you
might have had to solve a recurrence and

126
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
might have had to solve a recurrence and
 

127
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,949
might have had to solve a recurrence and
you might use master theorem, that kind

128
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
you might use master theorem, that kind
 

129
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,190
you might use master theorem, that kind
of thing, right? Or you use asmtotics

130
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
of thing, right? Or you use asmtotics
 

131
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,190
of thing, right? Or you use asmtotics
all the time or you need to remember in

132
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
all the time or you need to remember in
 

133
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,670
all the time or you need to remember in
our model, oh, it kind of matters how

134
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
our model, oh, it kind of matters how
 

135
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,910
our model, oh, it kind of matters how
big of an integer I can store and do

136
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
big of an integer I can store and do
 

137
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,070
big of an integer I can store and do
arithmetic on in constant time, right?

138
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
arithmetic on in constant time, right?
 

139
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,390
arithmetic on in constant time, right?
So for that pet 3 question you had at

140
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
So for that pet 3 question you had at
 

141
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,869
So for that pet 3 question you had at
the end of your the coding question,

142
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
the end of your the coding question,
 

143
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,229
the end of your the coding question,
right? Uh you you wanted to hash things

144
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
right? Uh you you wanted to hash things
 

145
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,910
right? Uh you you wanted to hash things
and you want you need to argue that

146
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
and you want you need to argue that
 

147
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,229
and you want you need to argue that
those things fit in a constant number of

148
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
those things fit in a constant number of
 

149
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,710
those things fit in a constant number of
words so that it that could be done in

150
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
words so that it that could be done in
 

151
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,110
words so that it that could be done in
constant time. A lot of you guys found

152
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
constant time. A lot of you guys found
 

153
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,670
constant time. A lot of you guys found
canonicalizations basically mapping to

154
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
canonicalizations basically mapping to
 

155
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,670
canonicalizations basically mapping to
things that were exponentially large.

156
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
things that were exponentially large.
 

157
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,750
things that were exponentially large.
So may maybe multiplying a product of

158
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
So may maybe multiplying a product of
 

159
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,430
So may maybe multiplying a product of
primes or something like that and that

160
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
primes or something like that and that
 

161
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,830
primes or something like that and that
would not be a good representation.

162
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
would not be a good representation.
 

163
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,710
would not be a good representation.
Okay. So the these things come up but

164
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay. So the these things come up but
 

165
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,229
Okay. So the these things come up but
they're not like the main focus of the

166
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
they're not like the main focus of the
 

167
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,830
they're not like the main focus of the
problems we solve. What are the main

168
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
problems we solve. What are the main
 

169
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,589
problems we solve. What are the main
focus of the how do we solve a

170
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
focus of the how do we solve a
 

171
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,430
focus of the how do we solve a
computational problem in this class? I

172
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
computational problem in this class? I
 

173
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,589
computational problem in this class? I
kind of gave you two ways at the

174
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
kind of gave you two ways at the
 

175
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,110
kind of gave you two ways at the
beginning of the term. Do you guys

176
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
beginning of the term. Do you guys
 

177
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,670
beginning of the term. Do you guys
remember

178
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
remember
 

179
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,710
remember
we can solve how to how to solve

180
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720

 

181
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,589

a computational computational

182
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599

 

183
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,589

problem?

184
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599

 

185
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,470

One's the hard way, one's the easy way.

186
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
One's the hard way, one's the easy way.
 

187
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,110
One's the hard way, one's the easy way.
Force. Brute force. Okay. So you're

188
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
Force. Brute force. Okay. So you're
 

189
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,429
Force. Brute force. Okay. So you're
describing to me a technique for making

190
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
describing to me a technique for making
 

191
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,030
describing to me a technique for making
your own algorithm, right? I can just,

192
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
your own algorithm, right? I can just,
 

193
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,429
your own algorithm, right? I can just,
you know, design my new algorithm from

194
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
you know, design my new algorithm from
 

195
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,190
you know, design my new algorithm from
scratch. One way I could do that is

196
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
scratch. One way I could do that is
 

197
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,949
scratch. One way I could do that is
brute force it, right? Look at all the

198
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
brute force it, right? Look at all the
 

199
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,630
brute force it, right? Look at all the
possible outputs and see which one

200
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
possible outputs and see which one
 

201
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,030
possible outputs and see which one
works, right? Or I could reduce to

202
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
works, right? Or I could reduce to
 

203
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,390
works, right? Or I could reduce to
something like divide and conquer or

204
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
something like divide and conquer or
 

205
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,910
something like divide and conquer or
something like that. That's generally a

206
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
something like that. That's generally a
 

207
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,030
something like that. That's generally a
hard thing to do to make your own

208
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
hard thing to do to make your own
 

209
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,509
hard thing to do to make your own
algorithm, right? That's why we don't

210
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
algorithm, right? That's why we don't
 

211
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,110
algorithm, right? That's why we don't
ask you to do it a lot in this class,

212
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
ask you to do it a lot in this class,
 

213
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,030
ask you to do it a lot in this class,
right? It's an 046 kind of thing, right?

214
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
right? It's an 046 kind of thing, right?
 

215
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,150
right? It's an 046 kind of thing, right?
So the first thing you could do is write

216
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
So the first thing you could do is write
 

217
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,710
So the first thing you could do is write
design

218
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
design
 

219
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,310
design
new

220
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
new
 

221
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,790
new
algorithm from

222
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
algorithm from
 

223
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,430
algorithm from
scratch. Usually it's not from scratch,

224
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
scratch. Usually it's not from scratch,
 

225
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,030
scratch. Usually it's not from scratch,
right? Usually you're reducing to some

226
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
right? Usually you're reducing to some
 

227
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,749
right? Usually you're reducing to some
kind of algorithmic design paradigm that

228
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
kind of algorithmic design paradigm that
 

229
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,749
kind of algorithmic design paradigm that
you've maybe heard of. You talk a lot

230
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
you've maybe heard of. You talk a lot
 

231
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,310
you've maybe heard of. You talk a lot
more about it in 046 and at the end of

232
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
more about it in 046 and at the end of
 

233
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,749
more about it in 046 and at the end of
this term when we talk about dynamic

234
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
this term when we talk about dynamic
 

235
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,310
this term when we talk about dynamic
programming, but generally that's a hard

236
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
programming, but generally that's a hard
 

237
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,710
programming, but generally that's a hard
thing to do, right? B you're you're

238
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
thing to do, right? B you're you're
 

239
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,749
thing to do, right? B you're you're
trying to think of a recursive

240
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
trying to think of a recursive
 

241
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,230
trying to think of a recursive
algorithm, right? You're trying to prove

242
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
algorithm, right? You're trying to prove
 

243
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,670
algorithm, right? You're trying to prove
that it's correct. All these

244
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
that it's correct. All these
 

245
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,430
that it's correct. All these
nitty-gritty. We we've actually

246
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
nitty-gritty. We we've actually
 

247
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,590
nitty-gritty. We we've actually
throughout the class in lectures have

248
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
throughout the class in lectures have
 

249
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,629
throughout the class in lectures have
been showing you the algorithms, but

250
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
been showing you the algorithms, but
 

251
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,550
been showing you the algorithms, but
we're not really expecting you to make

252
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
we're not really expecting you to make
 

253
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,310
we're not really expecting you to make
those algorithms. What are we expecting

254
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
those algorithms. What are we expecting
 

255
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,990
those algorithms. What are we expecting
you to do most of the time? Yeah. To

256
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
you to do most of the time? Yeah. To
 

257
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,230
you to do most of the time? Yeah. To
reduce it to a problem that we showed

258
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
reduce it to a problem that we showed
 

259
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:19,909
reduce it to a problem that we showed
you how to solve, right?

260
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919

 

261
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,830

I'm going to say thing here, but really

262
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm going to say thing here, but really
 

263
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,510
I'm going to say thing here, but really
what I mean is an algorithm that we've

264
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
what I mean is an algorithm that we've
 

265
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,270
what I mean is an algorithm that we've
taught you to basically here reduce to a

266
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
taught you to basically here reduce to a
 

267
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,070
taught you to basically here reduce to a
known thing. No to known thing. Uh

268
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
known thing. No to known thing. Uh
 

269
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,870
known thing. No to known thing. Uh
usually that means there's a problem or

270
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
usually that means there's a problem or
 

271
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,270
usually that means there's a problem or
an interface, right? That that we've

272
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
an interface, right? That that we've
 

273
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,310
an interface, right? That that we've
given you. And in general, we've shown

274
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
given you. And in general, we've shown
 

275
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,070
given you. And in general, we've shown
you multiple different ways to solve

276
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
you multiple different ways to solve
 

277
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,909
you multiple different ways to solve
that problem, right? Or interface,

278
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
that problem, right? Or interface,
 

279
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,790
that problem, right? Or interface,
right? So we've shown you many ways on

280
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
right? So we've shown you many ways on
 

281
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,350
right? So we've shown you many ways on
how to sort things right and we've shown

282
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
how to sort things right and we've shown
 

283
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,189
how to sort things right and we've shown
you many ways on how to implement

284
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
you many ways on how to implement
 

285
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,430
you many ways on how to implement
sequence and set interfaces. Remember uh

286
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
sequence and set interfaces. Remember uh
 

287
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,350
sequence and set interfaces. Remember uh
and uh a lot of times the the types of

288
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
and uh a lot of times the the types of
 

289
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,270
and uh a lot of times the the types of
problems that we're asking you to do is

290
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
problems that we're asking you to do is
 

291
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,150
problems that we're asking you to do is
to just use as a blackbox some of the

292
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
to just use as a blackbox some of the
 

293
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,990
to just use as a blackbox some of the
things that we did but you need as a

294
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
things that we did but you need as a
 

295
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,309
things that we did but you need as a
programmer as a as a computer scientist

296
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
programmer as a as a computer scientist
 

297
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,870
programmer as a as a computer scientist
you need to tell me when I should use

298
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
you need to tell me when I should use
 

299
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,590
you need to tell me when I should use
what when. Right. Yeah. Could you

300
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
what when. Right. Yeah. Could you
 

301
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,350
what when. Right. Yeah. Could you
clarify what you mean by use as a black

302
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
clarify what you mean by use as a black
 

303
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,670
clarify what you mean by use as a black
box? Use as a black box. Exactly. Right.

304
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
box? Use as a black box. Exactly. Right.
 

305
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,309
box? Use as a black box. Exactly. Right.
Um, so this is a phrase that I use and a

306
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
Um, so this is a phrase that I use and a
 

307
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,990
Um, so this is a phrase that I use and a
lot of people in computer science use.

308
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
lot of people in computer science use.
 

309
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,029
lot of people in computer science use.
It's basically uh you import a library

310
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
It's basically uh you import a library
 

311
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,909
It's basically uh you import a library
into your code, right? What do I have? I

312
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
into your code, right? What do I have? I
 

313
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,990
into your code, right? What do I have? I
have a kind of an API. I have a way to

314
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
have a kind of an API. I have a way to
 

315
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,909
have a kind of an API. I have a way to
interact with that code. I don't

316
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
interact with that code. I don't
 

317
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,150
interact with that code. I don't
actually know what's going on inside of

318
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
actually know what's going on inside of
 

319
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,950
actually know what's going on inside of
that library, right? I'm using it as a

320
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
that library, right? I'm using it as a
 

321
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,510
that library, right? I'm using it as a
black box. I it's opaque to me. I cannot

322
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
black box. I it's opaque to me. I cannot
 

323
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,270
black box. I it's opaque to me. I cannot
look inside what I mean I actually

324
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
look inside what I mean I actually
 

325
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,950
look inside what I mean I actually
probably could look inside what their

326
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
probably could look inside what their
 

327
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,029
probably could look inside what their
code is but I'm not going to. The thing

328
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
code is but I'm not going to. The thing
 

329
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,189
code is but I'm not going to. The thing
that makes it useful to me is that it

330
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
that makes it useful to me is that it
 

331
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,390
that makes it useful to me is that it
has this useful API that I trust it to

332
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
has this useful API that I trust it to
 

333
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,629
has this useful API that I trust it to
do the things that you told me that it

334
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
do the things that you told me that it
 

335
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,870
do the things that you told me that it
was going to do, right? And so there's

336
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
was going to do, right? And so there's
 

337
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,510
was going to do, right? And so there's
kind of I'm going to jump around a

338
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
kind of I'm going to jump around a
 

339
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,350
kind of I'm going to jump around a
little bit here actually because that's

340
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
little bit here actually because that's
 

341
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,909
little bit here actually because that's
a great question. uh uh so here

342
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
a great question. uh uh so here
 

343
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,390
a great question. uh uh so here
I think of there's kind of three

344
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
I think of there's kind of three
 

345
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,189
I think of there's kind of three
different types of problems that we talk

346
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
different types of problems that we talk
 

347
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,830
different types of problems that we talk
about that we give you in this class you

348
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
about that we give you in this class you
 

349
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,909
about that we give you in this class you
might have seen this on the problem set

350
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
might have seen this on the problem set
 

351
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,469
might have seen this on the problem set
right I I like to categorize them into

352
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
right I I like to categorize them into
 

353
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,270
right I I like to categorize them into
kind of three different categories here

354
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
kind of three different categories here
 

355
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,950
kind of three different categories here
one is you kind of have to understand

356
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
one is you kind of have to understand
 

357
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,029
one is you kind of have to understand
the internals of a data structure and

358
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
the internals of a data structure and
 

359
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,270
the internals of a data structure and
algorithm that we know right you have to

360
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
algorithm that we know right you have to
 

361
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,830
algorithm that we know right you have to
be able to look inside and I don't know

362
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
be able to look inside and I don't know
 

363
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,710
be able to look inside and I don't know
given a node in a balanced binary search

364
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
given a node in a balanced binary search
 

365
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,270
given a node in a balanced binary search
tree, an AVL tree, right? How can I do a

366
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
tree, an AVL tree, right? How can I do a
 

367
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,150
tree, an AVL tree, right? How can I do a
rotation, right? Or how do I do an

368
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
rotation, right? Or how do I do an
 

369
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,990
rotation, right? Or how do I do an
insert or uh uh something about the

370
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
insert or uh uh something about the
 

371
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,029
insert or uh uh something about the
structure of this thing, a binary heap,

372
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
structure of this thing, a binary heap,
 

373
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,790
structure of this thing, a binary heap,
right? Where are the top k things in a

374
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
right? Where are the top k things in a
 

375
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,550
right? Where are the top k things in a
max binary heap which is on your problem

376
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
max binary heap which is on your problem
 

377
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,909
max binary heap which is on your problem
set, right? Those things require me to

378
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
set, right? Those things require me to
 

379
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,869
set, right? Those things require me to
very much not blackbox these data

380
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
very much not blackbox these data
 

381
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,589
very much not blackbox these data
structures. It's a white box, right? I

382
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
structures. It's a white box, right? I
 

383
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,270
structures. It's a white box, right? I
need to know what's inside of that to

384
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
need to know what's inside of that to
 

385
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,869
need to know what's inside of that to
answer that question, right? I need to

386
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
answer that question, right? I need to
 

387
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,390
answer that question, right? I need to
know about the internals of that data

388
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
know about the internals of that data
 

389
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,469
know about the internals of that data
structure, right? And there are other

390
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
structure, right? And there are other
 

391
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,710
structure, right? And there are other
types of problems where it's like, oh, I

392
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
types of problems where it's like, oh, I
 

393
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,230
types of problems where it's like, oh, I
don't need to know what the internals of

394
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
don't need to know what the internals of
 

395
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,629
don't need to know what the internals of
this data structure is, right? I can

396
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
this data structure is, right? I can
 

397
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,749
this data structure is, right? I can
just operate with knowledge of the API,

398
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
just operate with knowledge of the API,
 

399
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,990
just operate with knowledge of the API,
right? And try to hook it in to the

400
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
right? And try to hook it in to the
 

401
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,830
right? And try to hook it in to the
problem that I need. And that's what I

402
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
problem that I need. And that's what I
 

403
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,070
problem that I need. And that's what I
call a reduction type problem, right?

404
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
call a reduction type problem, right?
 

405
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,309
call a reduction type problem, right?
This is like how does the core material

406
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
This is like how does the core material
 

407
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,790
This is like how does the core material
we presented to you in lecture work,

408
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
we presented to you in lecture work,
 

409
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,710
we presented to you in lecture work,
right? This is like how do I apply that

410
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
right? This is like how do I apply that
 

411
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,070
right? This is like how do I apply that
core material, right? And harder than

412
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
core material, right? And harder than
 

413
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,469
core material, right? And harder than
both of those things, right? Is what I

414
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
both of those things, right? Is what I
 

415
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,790
both of those things, right? Is what I
might call a modification type of pro. I

416
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
might call a modification type of pro. I
 

417
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,230
might call a modification type of pro. I
mean, these aren't really good names. I

418
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
mean, these aren't really good names. I
 

419
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,230
mean, these aren't really good names. I
came up with these this morning, right?

420
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
came up with these this morning, right?
 

421
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,469
came up with these this morning, right?
But it's trying to get at the the idea

422
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
But it's trying to get at the the idea
 

423
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,110
But it's trying to get at the the idea
here that it's possible that you kind of

424
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
here that it's possible that you kind of
 

425
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,790
here that it's possible that you kind of
need to know what the API is and you

426
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
need to know what the API is and you
 

427
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,990
need to know what the API is and you
kind of need to know what's going on

428
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
kind of need to know what's going on
 

429
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,670
kind of need to know what's going on
inside to be able to answer the problem.

430
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
inside to be able to answer the problem.
 

431
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,310
inside to be able to answer the problem.
Things like um adapting a divide and

432
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
Things like um adapting a divide and
 

433
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,590
Things like um adapting a divide and
conquer algorithm, right? or uh making

434
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
conquer algorithm, right? or uh making
 

435
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,230
conquer algorithm, right? or uh making
uh instead of using a dynamic array

436
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
uh instead of using a dynamic array
 

437
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,790
uh instead of using a dynamic array
that's has extra space on one end maybe

438
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
that's has extra space on one end maybe
 

439
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,790
that's has extra space on one end maybe
I have to put extra space in the middle

440
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
I have to put extra space in the middle
 

441
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,230
I have to put extra space in the middle
or something like that right I'm

442
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
or something like that right I'm
 

443
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,150
or something like that right I'm
adapting something that was from the

444
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
adapting something that was from the
 

445
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,230
adapting something that was from the
core material it's pretty close but I

446
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
core material it's pretty close but I
 

447
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,430
core material it's pretty close but I
have to modify it in some way

448
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
have to modify it in some way
 

449
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,750
have to modify it in some way
augmentation right I have to take the

450
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
augmentation right I have to take the
 

451
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,790
augmentation right I have to take the
vanilla set AVL tree that I might have

452
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
vanilla set AVL tree that I might have
 

453
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,630
vanilla set AVL tree that I might have
given you right and put some other

454
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
given you right and put some other
 

455
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,990
given you right and put some other
property on the nodes and you need to

456
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
property on the nodes and you need to
 

457
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,030
property on the nodes and you need to
tell me how to maintain that right how

458
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
tell me how to maintain that right how
 

459
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,949
tell me how to maintain that right how
how can I compute that subree property

460
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
how can I compute that subree property
 

461
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,190
how can I compute that subree property
from its children. Does that make sense?

462
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
from its children. Does that make sense?
 

463
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,990
from its children. Does that make sense?
Uh so kind of this is the harder of the

464
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
Uh so kind of this is the harder of the
 

465
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,550
Uh so kind of this is the harder of the
things, right? If you can identify which

466
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
things, right? If you can identify which
 

467
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,870
things, right? If you can identify which
one of these a problem that you look at

468
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
one of these a problem that you look at
 

469
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,590
one of these a problem that you look at
on an exam fit under, maybe that can

470
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
on an exam fit under, maybe that can
 

471
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,230
on an exam fit under, maybe that can
help you kind of conceptualize what

472
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
help you kind of conceptualize what
 

473
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,990
help you kind of conceptualize what
should I use for a reduction type

474
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
should I use for a reduction type
 

475
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,590
should I use for a reduction type
problem. We're going to talk about this

476
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
problem. We're going to talk about this
 

477
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,389
problem. We're going to talk about this
in a sec second, but a lot of times it's

478
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
in a sec second, but a lot of times it's
 

479
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,509
in a sec second, but a lot of times it's
useful to reduce it to

480
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
useful to reduce it to
 

481
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,790
useful to reduce it to
uh a problem or an interface

482
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
uh a problem or an interface
 

483
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,150
uh a problem or an interface
rather than an algorithm or a data

484
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
rather than an algorithm or a data
 

485
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,150
rather than an algorithm or a data
structure. What does that mean? Does

486
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
structure. What does that mean? Does
 

487
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,949
structure. What does that mean? Does
if if I can solve the problem by saying

488
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
if if I can solve the problem by saying
 

489
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,230
if if I can solve the problem by saying
reducing to sorting, right? I can argue

490
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
reducing to sorting, right? I can argue
 

491
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,910
reducing to sorting, right? I can argue
to you that that algorithm is correct. I

492
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
to you that that algorithm is correct. I
 

493
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,990
to you that that algorithm is correct. I
just use sorting as a black box. No, it

494
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
just use sorting as a black box. No, it
 

495
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,389
just use sorting as a black box. No, it
might not be efficient, right? my choice

496
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
might not be efficient, right? my choice
 

497
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,310
might not be efficient, right? my choice
of sorting algorithm that I chose

498
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
of sorting algorithm that I chose
 

499
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,790
of sorting algorithm that I chose
matters right for efficiency but for

500
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
matters right for efficiency but for
 

501
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,269
matters right for efficiency but for
correctness it doesn't matter right for

502
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
correctness it doesn't matter right for
 

503
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,470
correctness it doesn't matter right for
a a data structures problem I might

504
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
a a data structures problem I might
 

505
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,590
a a data structures problem I might
reduce to using two set data structures

506
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
reduce to using two set data structures
 

507
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,190
reduce to using two set data structures
and a sequence data structure or

508
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
and a sequence data structure or
 

509
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,670
and a sequence data structure or
something like that right but uh

510
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
something like that right but uh
 

511
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,829
something like that right but uh
and it will be correct if I reduce it to

512
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
and it will be correct if I reduce it to
 

513
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,069
and it will be correct if I reduce it to
those things right I can define the

514
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
those things right I can define the
 

515
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,470
those things right I can define the
operations in terms of those those

516
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
operations in terms of those those

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
interfaces
 

519
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,230
interfaces
I don't have to make that choice until I

520
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
I don't have to make that choice until I
 

521
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,990
I don't have to make that choice until I
talk about running time, right? Until I

522
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
talk about running time, right? Until I
 

523
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,069
talk about running time, right? Until I
talk about efficiency and the name of

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
the game on the quiz to get points, we
 

527
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,550
the game on the quiz to get points, we
can't give you points for an incorrect

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
can't give you points for an incorrect
 

529
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,110
can't give you points for an incorrect
algorithm, right? Or something that's

530
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
algorithm, right? Or something that's
 

531
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,470
algorithm, right? Or something that's
pretty close to correct, right? Uh and

532
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
pretty close to correct, right? Uh and
 

533
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,389
pretty close to correct, right? Uh and
we can't give you full points unless the

534
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
we can't give you full points unless the
 

535
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,829
we can't give you full points unless the
correct algorithm you give us is

536
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
correct algorithm you give us is
 

537
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,110
correct algorithm you give us is
efficient, right? And that you've argued

538
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
efficient, right? And that you've argued
 

539
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,790
efficient, right? And that you've argued
things like correctness and running time

540
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
things like correctness and running time
 

541
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,710
things like correctness and running time
and things like that, right? like your

542
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
and things like that, right? like your
 

543
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,710
and things like that, right? like your
algorithm could be correct uh and

544
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
algorithm could be correct uh and
 

545
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,389
algorithm could be correct uh and
efficient but you analyze the running

546
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
efficient but you analyze the running
 

547
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,030
efficient but you analyze the running
time incorrectly so we mark your points

548
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
time incorrectly so we mark your points
 

549
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,069
time incorrectly so we mark your points
off for there or you you mo most of the

550
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
off for there or you you mo most of the
 

551
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,590
off for there or you you mo most of the
time what you do is you present us with

552
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
time what you do is you present us with
 

553
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,310
time what you do is you present us with
an inefficient algorithm and then you

554
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
an inefficient algorithm and then you
 

555
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,150
an inefficient algorithm and then you
analyze the running time as if it's the

556
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
analyze the running time as if it's the
 

557
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,150
analyze the running time as if it's the
target running time that we gave you

558
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
target running time that we gave you
 

559
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,190
target running time that we gave you
right that's bad on two fronts right

560
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
right that's bad on two fronts right
 

561
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,509
right that's bad on two fronts right
okay so try not to fall into these traps

562
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
okay so try not to fall into these traps
 

563
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,350
okay so try not to fall into these traps
okay so some general test taking

564
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
okay so some general test taking
 

565
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,949
okay so some general test taking
strategies when you're looking at your

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
strategies when you're looking at your
 

567
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,750

quiz

568
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
quiz
 

569
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,069
quiz
I really strongly urge you to read

570
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
I really strongly urge you to read
 

571
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,750
I really strongly urge you to read
through the entire exam before you

572
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
through the entire exam before you
 

573
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,389
through the entire exam before you
start, right? Because some of the

574
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
start, right? Because some of the
 

575
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,910
start, right? Because some of the
problems will be easier for you than

576
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
problems will be easier for you than
 

577
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,750
problems will be easier for you than
others. And if you're trying to maximize

578
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
others. And if you're trying to maximize
 

579
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,230
others. And if you're trying to maximize
points on here, right, as all of you,

580
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
points on here, right, as all of you,
 

581
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,990
points on here, right, as all of you,
I'm sure, are trying to do, uh, it's use

582
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm sure, are trying to do, uh, it's use
 

583
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,230
I'm sure, are trying to do, uh, it's use
useful to make that initial pass through

584
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
useful to make that initial pass through
 

585
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,990
useful to make that initial pass through
the problems to see which ones are

586
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
the problems to see which ones are
 

587
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,150
the problems to see which ones are
easiest for you, right? And then you can

588
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
easiest for you, right? And then you can
 

589
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,790
easiest for you, right? And then you can
tackle them in the the order in which

590
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
tackle them in the the order in which
 

591
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,509
tackle them in the the order in which
you have confidence. Now, in actuality,

592
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
you have confidence. Now, in actuality,
 

593
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,790
you have confidence. Now, in actuality,
the average on say quiz one of this

594
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
the average on say quiz one of this
 

595
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,750
the average on say quiz one of this
class tends to be around, I don't know,

596
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
class tends to be around, I don't know,
 

597
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,670
class tends to be around, I don't know,
between a 60 and an 80. I don't think

598
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
between a 60 and an 80. I don't think
 

599
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,310
between a 60 and an 80. I don't think
it's ever been 80, but right, uh, but,

600
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
it's ever been 80, but right, uh, but,
 

601
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,310
it's ever been 80, but right, uh, but,
you know, it's it's not 100, right? So

602
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
you know, it's it's not 100, right? So
 

603
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,269
you know, it's it's not 100, right? So
doing 50% of the problems well right is

604
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
doing 50% of the problems well right is
 

605
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,350
doing 50% of the problems well right is
probably going to be better for you in

606
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
probably going to be better for you in
 

607
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,110
probably going to be better for you in
terms of time management and you know

608
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
terms of time management and you know
 

609
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,829
terms of time management and you know
those kinds of things than doing all of

610
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
those kinds of things than doing all of
 

611
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,590
those kinds of things than doing all of
the like attempting all of the problems

612
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
the like attempting all of the problems
 

613
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,389
the like attempting all of the problems
and not doing great on any of them right

614
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
and not doing great on any of them right
 

615
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,949
and not doing great on any of them right
in terms of point man right you have to

616
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
in terms of point man right you have to
 

617
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,470
in terms of point man right you have to
in computer science you have to be

618
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
in computer science you have to be
 

619
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,470
in computer science you have to be
pretty close to a correct answer to get

620
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
pretty close to a correct answer to get
 

621
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,069
pretty close to a correct answer to get
points right it it basically needs to be

622
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
points right it it basically needs to be
 

623
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,030
points right it it basically needs to be
almost correct or you don't get if If

624
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
almost correct or you don't get if If
 

625
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,710
almost correct or you don't get if If
you've seen how your problem sets are

626
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
you've seen how your problem sets are
 

627
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,550
you've seen how your problem sets are
being graded, sometimes our problem set

628
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
being graded, sometimes our problem set
 

629
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,430
being graded, sometimes our problem set
graders make mistakes. Sometimes they

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
graders make mistakes. Sometimes they
 

631
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,629
graders make mistakes. Sometimes they
accept give you points for for uh an

00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
accept give you points for for uh an
 

633
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,110
accept give you points for for uh an
incorrect solution, right? It's really

634
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
incorrect solution, right? It's really
 

635
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,430
incorrect solution, right? It's really
on you to take a look at your problem

636
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
on you to take a look at your problem
 

637
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,590
on you to take a look at your problem
sets that you gave us and our solutions

638
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
sets that you gave us and our solutions
 

639
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,590
sets that you gave us and our solutions
that we gave you. We spend a lot of time

640
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
that we gave you. We spend a lot of time
 

641
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,389
that we gave you. We spend a lot of time
writing good solutions for you guys. You

642
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
writing good solutions for you guys. You
 

643
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,670
writing good solutions for you guys. You
need to make sure that you know the

644
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
need to make sure that you know the
 

645
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,509
need to make sure that you know the
material.

646
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
material.
 

647
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,990
material.
Don't come up to us at the end of an

648
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't come up to us at the end of an
 

649
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,509
Don't come up to us at the end of an
exam and say, "Oh, I said the same thing

650
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
exam and say, "Oh, I said the same thing
 

651
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,509
exam and say, "Oh, I said the same thing
on my problem set. It was marked correct

652
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
on my problem set. It was marked correct
 

653
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,829
on my problem set. It was marked correct
and you guys marked it wrong." Well,

654
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
and you guys marked it wrong." Well,
 

655
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,750
and you guys marked it wrong." Well,
yeah, the staff knows a little bit more

656
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
yeah, the staff knows a little bit more
 

657
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,310
yeah, the staff knows a little bit more
about algorithms than your graders on

658
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
about algorithms than your graders on
 

659
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,069
about algorithms than your graders on
your problem sets and we grade your

660
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
your problem sets and we grade your
 

661
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,389
your problem sets and we grade your
exams. So, unfortunately, that's not an

662
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
exams. So, unfortunately, that's not an
 

663
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,150
exams. So, unfortunately, that's not an
excuse, right? It's on you to know the

664
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
excuse, right? It's on you to know the
 

665
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,430
excuse, right? It's on you to know the
material. Yep. So are most of the

666
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
material. Yep. So are most of the
 

667
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,110
material. Yep. So are most of the
problems on the exam sort of like

668
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
problems on the exam sort of like
 

669
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,629
problems on the exam sort of like
multiple part things where we need to

670
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
multiple part things where we need to
 

671
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,230
multiple part things where we need to
like have a good understanding and do

672
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
like have a good understanding and do
 

673
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,590
like have a good understanding and do
like the first few parts right in order

674
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
like the first few parts right in order
 

675
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,190
like the first few parts right in order
to get even partial credit on the other

676
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,200
to get even partial credit on the other
 

677
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,069
to get even partial credit on the other
parts or is it like yeah so the question

678
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
parts or is it like yeah so the question
 

679
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,470
parts or is it like yeah so the question
is uh is it kind of are our questions

680
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
is uh is it kind of are our questions
 

681
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,829
is uh is it kind of are our questions
built on top of each other right so that

682
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
built on top of each other right so that
 

683
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,670
built on top of each other right so that
you're kind of at a wall if you miss the

684
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
you're kind of at a wall if you miss the
 

685
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,910
you're kind of at a wall if you miss the
first part right we try not to design

686
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
first part right we try not to design
 

687
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,910
first part right we try not to design
exams that way okay you can actually

688
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
exams that way okay you can actually
 

689
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,750
exams that way okay you can actually
take a look at um the practice exam

690
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
take a look at um the practice exam
 

691
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,269
take a look at um the practice exam
that's already been posted

692
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
that's already been posted
 

693
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,590
that's already been posted
Right? They t our problems tend to be

694
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
Right? They t our problems tend to be
 

695
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,310
Right? They t our problems tend to be
self-contained and if they are multiple

696
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
self-contained and if they are multiple
 

697
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,150
self-contained and if they are multiple
parts, the parts are usually

698
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
parts, the parts are usually
 

699
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,670
parts, the parts are usually
independent.

700
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
independent.
 

701
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,910
independent.
Right? Usually you don't need to have

702
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
Right? Usually you don't need to have
 

703
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,230
Right? Usually you don't need to have
done A correctly in order to do B

704
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
done A correctly in order to do B
 

705
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,790
done A correctly in order to do B
correctly. Right? And that's how our

706
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
correctly. Right? And that's how our
 

707
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,389
correctly. Right? And that's how our
problem sets try to be written as well.

708
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
problem sets try to be written as well.
 

709
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,670
problem sets try to be written as well.
Right? For your last the coding question

710
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
Right? For your last the coding question
 

711
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,069
Right? For your last the coding question
on P set 4, right? You had this problem

712
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
on P set 4, right? You had this problem
 

713
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,430
on P set 4, right? You had this problem
where you had to design this data

714
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
where you had to design this data
 

715
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,629
where you had to design this data
structure, right? But C said use that as

716
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
structure, right? But C said use that as
 

717
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,949
structure, right? But C said use that as
a black box essentially and solve the

718
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
a black box essentially and solve the
 

719
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,269
a black box essentially and solve the
problem. Right? So you actually don't

720
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
problem. Right? So you actually don't
 

721
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,509
problem. Right? So you actually don't
need to show we've given you this

722
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
need to show we've given you this
 

723
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,990
need to show we've given you this
interface. Right? You can just use that

724
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
interface. Right? You can just use that
 

725
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,790
interface. Right? You can just use that
interface to be able to answer C the

726
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
interface to be able to answer C the
 

727
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,670
interface to be able to answer C the
algorithms question without even solving

728
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
algorithms question without even solving
 

729
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,590
algorithms question without even solving
the data structures question correctly.

730
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
the data structures question correctly.
 

731
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,829
the data structures question correctly.
Does that make sense? And actually that

732
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
Does that make sense? And actually that
 

733
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,430
Does that make sense? And actually that
was the algorithms question was the

734
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
was the algorithms question was the
 

735
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,590
was the algorithms question was the
easier one there I think from what I

736
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
easier one there I think from what I
 

737
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,590
easier one there I think from what I
remember. Yeah. Do we have to write code

738
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
remember. Yeah. Do we have to write code
 

739
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,509
remember. Yeah. Do we have to write code
on the exam? Do you have to write code

740
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
on the exam? Do you have to write code
 

741
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,430
on the exam? Do you have to write code
on the exam? Uh

742
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
on the exam? Uh
 

743
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,829
on the exam? Uh
I've never given an exam where you've

744
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
I've never given an exam where you've
 

745
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,750
I've never given an exam where you've
had to write code. I have written exams

746
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
had to write code. I have written exams
 

747
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,949
had to write code. I have written exams
where you have to read code. Okay. So

748
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
where you have to read code. Okay. So
 

749
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,590
where you have to read code. Okay. So
pseudo code or Python, right? Since

750
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
pseudo code or Python, right? Since
 

751
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,350
pseudo code or Python, right? Since
Python's a prerequisite for this class,

752
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
Python's a prerequisite for this class,
 

753
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,189
Python's a prerequisite for this class,
it's completely fair game that we give

754
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
it's completely fair game that we give
 

755
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,949
it's completely fair game that we give
you small snippets of Python code and

756
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
you small snippets of Python code and
 

757
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,710
you small snippets of Python code and
you have to to be able to understand

758
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
you have to to be able to understand
 

759
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,430
you have to to be able to understand
what's going on.

760
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
what's going on.
 

761
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,629
what's going on.
Yeah. Um you listed

762
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
Yeah. Um you listed
 

763
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,670
Yeah. Um you listed
under the modification bar. So does that

764
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
under the modification bar. So does that
 

765
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,550
under the modification bar. So does that
mean like if we're using an amortized

766
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
mean like if we're using an amortized
 

767
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,269
mean like if we're using an amortized
like what I mean here right amortization

768
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
like what I mean here right amortization
 

769
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,750
like what I mean here right amortization
certainly appears in here or here right

770
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:37,760
certainly appears in here or here right
 

771
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,990
certainly appears in here or here right
these kinds of things right often times

772
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
these kinds of things right often times
 

773
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,990
these kinds of things right often times
like if I'm using a dynamic array if I'm

774
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
like if I'm using a dynamic array if I'm
 

775
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,829
like if I'm using a dynamic array if I'm
using a binary heap if I'm using a hash

776
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
using a binary heap if I'm using a hash
 

777
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,670
using a binary heap if I'm using a hash
table right amortization will appear

778
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
table right amortization will appear
 

779
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,990
table right amortization will appear
here in our running times right for

780
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
here in our running times right for
 

781
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,590
here in our running times right for
those dynamic operations what I mean

782
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
those dynamic operations what I mean
 

783
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,230
those dynamic operations what I mean
here in amortization I mean like if I'm

784
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
here in amortization I mean like if I'm
 

785
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,069
here in amortization I mean like if I'm
asking you to generalize something that

786
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
asking you to generalize something that
 

787
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,470
asking you to generalize something that
we've done like with dynamic arrays

788
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
we've done like with dynamic arrays
 

789
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,430
we've done like with dynamic arrays
where instead of adding additional space

790
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
where instead of adding additional space
 

791
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,430
where instead of adding additional space
at the end, I'm putting additional space

792
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
at the end, I'm putting additional space
 

793
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,910
at the end, I'm putting additional space
in the middle or at the beginning or

794
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
in the middle or at the beginning or
 

795
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,269
in the middle or at the beginning or
something like that. And you're having

796
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
something like that. And you're having
 

797
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,150
something like that. And you're having
to do some kind of amortized analysis.

798
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
to do some kind of amortized analysis.
 

799
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,990
to do some kind of amortized analysis.
Now, often it's unnecessary to do this,

800
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
Now, often it's unnecessary to do this,
 

801
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,990
Now, often it's unnecessary to do this,
right? In in uh when we talked about a

802
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
right? In in uh when we talked about a
 

803
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,710
right? In in uh when we talked about a
problem where we did do our own

804
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
problem where we did do our own
 

805
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,550
problem where we did do our own
amortized analysis and making a

806
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
amortized analysis and making a
 

807
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,269
amortized analysis and making a
double-ended deck, right? I mean, a

808
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
double-ended deck, right? I mean, a
 

809
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,509
double-ended deck, right? I mean, a
double-ended queue. uh you could

810
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
double-ended queue. uh you could
 

811
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,350
double-ended queue. uh you could
actually solve it by reducing to using

812
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
actually solve it by reducing to using
 

813
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,590
actually solve it by reducing to using
two

814
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
two
 

815
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,870
two
uh dynamic arrays. Right? So there

816
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
uh dynamic arrays. Right? So there
 

817
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,110
uh dynamic arrays. Right? So there
there's uh there's a lot of ways in

818
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
there's uh there's a lot of ways in
 

819
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,269
there's uh there's a lot of ways in
which

820
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
which
 

821
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,670
which
you could reduce to using things but you

822
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
you could reduce to using things but you
 

823
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,949
you could reduce to using things but you
might have to do some additional

824
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
might have to do some additional
 

825
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,110
might have to do some additional
bookkeeping at the end. Right? But what

826
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
bookkeeping at the end. Right? But what
 

827
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,790
bookkeeping at the end. Right? But what
this is saying is that these are more

828
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
this is saying is that these are more
 

829
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,470
this is saying is that these are more
you're not using things as a black box.

830
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
you're not using things as a black box.
 

831
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,310
you're not using things as a black box.
You're changing something about the

832
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
You're changing something about the
 

833
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,470
You're changing something about the
boxes that we gave you. Right? Does that

834
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
boxes that we gave you. Right? Does that
 

835
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,670
boxes that we gave you. Right? Does that
make sense? Yeah, if you tell us to

836
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
make sense? Yeah, if you tell us to
 

837
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,509
make sense? Yeah, if you tell us to
write an algorithm that does something

838
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
write an algorithm that does something
 

839
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,710
write an algorithm that does something
like log n time and we can think only of

840
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
like log n time and we can think only of
 

841
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,069
like log n time and we can think only of
an algorithm that does something

842
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
an algorithm that does something
 

843
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,789
an algorithm that does something
inefficiently like end time. Okay. Then

844
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
inefficiently like end time. Okay. Then
 

845
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,949
inefficiently like end time. Okay. Then
is there any point writing that? Sure.

846
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
is there any point writing that? Sure.
 

847
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,189
is there any point writing that? Sure.
So let's actually move uh on for a

848
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
So let's actually move uh on for a
 

849
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,470
So let's actually move uh on for a
second. I actually there's

850
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480

 

851
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,309

I'm going to answer your question very

852
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
I'm going to answer your question very
 

853
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,590
I'm going to answer your question very
soon. Okay. Uh but I'm going to get to

854
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
soon. Okay. Uh but I'm going to get to
 

855
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,750
soon. Okay. Uh but I'm going to get to
it in a second. Okay. If I don't mind,

856
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
it in a second. Okay. If I don't mind,
 

857
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,829
it in a second. Okay. If I don't mind,
if I don't answer that question in five

858
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
if I don't answer that question in five
 

859
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,710
if I don't answer that question in five
minutes, please let me know. Okay. So,

860
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
minutes, please let me know. Okay. So,
 

861
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,470
minutes, please let me know. Okay. So,
so the first thing when I'm approaching

862
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
so the first thing when I'm approaching
 

863
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,750
so the first thing when I'm approaching
a problem on on the exam, I might try to

864
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
a problem on on the exam, I might try to
 

865
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,830
a problem on on the exam, I might try to
ask some questions about the problem.

866
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
ask some questions about the problem.
 

867
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,669
ask some questions about the problem.
Okay? It's going to help me decide what

868
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
Okay? It's going to help me decide what
 

869
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,070
Okay? It's going to help me decide what
to use, right? Different than your

870
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
to use, right? Different than your
 

871
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,950
to use, right? Different than your
problem sets, right? Your problem sets

872
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
problem sets, right? Your problem sets
 

873
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,270
problem sets, right? Your problem sets
basically what do you use is what did we

874
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
basically what do you use is what did we
 

875
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,190
basically what do you use is what did we
talk about in lecture that week, right?

876
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
talk about in lecture that week, right?
 

877
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,430
talk about in lecture that week, right?
On a quiz, you have eight lectures that

878
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
On a quiz, you have eight lectures that
 

879
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,990
On a quiz, you have eight lectures that
you've talked about. And so that this is

880
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
you've talked about. And so that this is
 

881
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,430
you've talked about. And so that this is
going to be a harder thing for you to

882
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
going to be a harder thing for you to
 

883
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,190
going to be a harder thing for you to
do, right? Because you don't know which

884
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
do, right? Because you don't know which
 

885
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,029
do, right? Because you don't know which
of the eight lecture material is going

886
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
of the eight lecture material is going
 

887
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,390
of the eight lecture material is going
to apply to this problem. And it could

888
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
to apply to this problem. And it could
 

889
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,750
to apply to this problem. And it could
be a combination of them actually,

890
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
be a combination of them actually,
 

891
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,750
be a combination of them actually,
right? And so I'm trying to give you

892
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
right? And so I'm trying to give you
 

893
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,390
right? And so I'm trying to give you
ways of answering that question faster.

894
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
ways of answering that question faster.
 

895
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,350
ways of answering that question faster.
Okay? So, uh, is this a mechanical

896
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
Okay? So, uh, is this a mechanical
 

897
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,950
Okay? So, uh, is this a mechanical
reduction or modification type problem?

898
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
reduction or modification type problem?
 

899
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,549
reduction or modification type problem?
That's just going to help me determine

900
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
That's just going to help me determine
 

901
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,990
That's just going to help me determine
kind of the difficulty level of what

902
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
kind of the difficulty level of what
 

903
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,270
kind of the difficulty level of what
this is. You might not be able to answer

904
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
this is. You might not be able to answer
 

905
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,430
this is. You might not be able to answer
it, right? But it can give you a sense

906
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
it, right? But it can give you a sense
 

907
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,590
it, right? But it can give you a sense
for what kind of problem it is. Is this

908
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
for what kind of problem it is. Is this
 

909
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,750
for what kind of problem it is. Is this
a problem about data structures sorting

910
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
a problem about data structures sorting
 

911
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,510
a problem about data structures sorting
both? Right. Uh if it's about data

912
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
both? Right. Uh if it's about data
 

913
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,590
both? Right. Uh if it's about data
structures, do I need to support

914
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
structures, do I need to support
 

915
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,430
structures, do I need to support
sequence type operations? So I need to

916
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
sequence type operations? So I need to
 

917
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,549
sequence type operations? So I need to
store an exttrinsic order on something

918
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
store an exttrinsic order on something
 

919
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,830
store an exttrinsic order on something
or is it a a thing where I I care about

920
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
or is it a a thing where I I care about
 

921
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,669
or is it a a thing where I I care about
what the objects are? I'm trying to look

922
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
what the objects are? I'm trying to look
 

923
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,150
what the objects are? I'm trying to look
things up by what they are, right? Or

924
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
things up by what they are, right? Or
 

925
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,390
things up by what they are, right? Or
maybe both. Or maybe some combination,

926
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
maybe both. Or maybe some combination,
 

927
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,150
maybe both. Or maybe some combination,
right? If I have a bunch of different

928
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
right? If I have a bunch of different
 

929
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,830
right? If I have a bunch of different
types of keys that I might want to query

930
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
types of keys that I might want to query
 

931
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,150
types of keys that I might want to query
on, right? I might have to use at least

932
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
on, right? I might have to use at least
 

933
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,710
on, right? I might have to use at least
two set type of data structures, right?

934
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
two set type of data structures, right?
 

935
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,070
two set type of data structures, right?
You could get very complicated with

936
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
You could get very complicated with
 

937
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,390
You could get very complicated with
these things, but putting it in terms of

938
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
these things, but putting it in terms of
 

939
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,909
these things, but putting it in terms of
well, I'm going to need to do this kind

940
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:53,919
well, I'm going to need to do this kind
 

941
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,190
well, I'm going to need to do this kind
of operation on this these names, right?

942
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
of operation on this these names, right?
 

943
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,950
of operation on this these names, right?
Then I can think, oh, I need a set data

944
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
Then I can think, oh, I need a set data
 

945
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,470
Then I can think, oh, I need a set data
structure there. I'll think about how to

946
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
structure there. I'll think about how to
 

947
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,070
structure there. I'll think about how to
implement that later. Should I use a

948
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
implement that later. Should I use a
 

949
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,590
implement that later. Should I use a
hash table? Should I use a sorted array?

950
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
hash table? Should I use a sorted array?
 

951
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,390
hash table? Should I use a sorted array?
Should I use a AVL tree? Right? But, you

952
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
Should I use a AVL tree? Right? But, you
 

953
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,310
Should I use a AVL tree? Right? But, you
know, thinking about it first at the

954
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
know, thinking about it first at the
 

955
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,549
know, thinking about it first at the
abstract level of I need a set data

956
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
abstract level of I need a set data
 

957
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,390
abstract level of I need a set data
structure here, right? can help you

958
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
structure here, right? can help you
 

959
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,630
structure here, right? can help you
compartmentalize correctness versus

960
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
compartmentalize correctness versus
 

961
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,110
compartmentalize correctness versus
efficiency. Does that make sense? Okay.

962
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120
efficiency. Does that make sense? Okay.
 

963
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,390
efficiency. Does that make sense? Okay.
Uh if if you're stuck, this is your

964
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
Uh if if you're stuck, this is your
 

965
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,470
Uh if if you're stuck, this is your
question. If you're stuck, right, write

966
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
question. If you're stuck, right, write
 

967
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,750
question. If you're stuck, right, write
down a correct algorithm that's

968
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760
down a correct algorithm that's
 

969
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,549
down a correct algorithm that's
inefficient, right? We can give you

970
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
inefficient, right? We can give you
 

971
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,070
inefficient, right? We can give you
points for a correct algorithm that's

972
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
points for a correct algorithm that's
 

973
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,510
points for a correct algorithm that's
inefficient. At least it's a correct

974
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
inefficient. At least it's a correct
 

975
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,110
inefficient. At least it's a correct
algorithm, right? As better than other

976
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
algorithm, right? As better than other
 

977
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,230
algorithm, right? As better than other
things, right? Now if it's really if

978
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
things, right? Now if it's really if
 

979
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,950
things, right? Now if it's really if
it's exponential time

980
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
it's exponential time
 

981
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,750
it's exponential time
you might be limited to like 10 or 20%

982
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
you might be limited to like 10 or 20%
 

983
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,750
you might be limited to like 10 or 20%
of the points right but if it's you know

984
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
of the points right but if it's you know
 

985
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,510
of the points right but if it's you know
a log factor worse or linear factor

986
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
a log factor worse or linear factor
 

987
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,789
a log factor worse or linear factor
worse maybe that's okay right on a data

988
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
worse maybe that's okay right on a data
 

989
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,630
worse maybe that's okay right on a data
structures problem if any operation

990
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
structures problem if any operation
 

991
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,549
structures problem if any operation
takes order n time that's probably not

992
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
takes order n time that's probably not
 

993
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,669
takes order n time that's probably not
going to give you a lot of points

994
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
going to give you a lot of points
 

995
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,029
going to give you a lot of points
because the whole point of the data

996
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
because the whole point of the data
 

997
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,470
because the whole point of the data
structure is to make those operations

998
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
structure is to make those operations
 

999
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,470
structure is to make those operations
fast right but you know if If it solves

1000
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
fast right but you know if If it solves
 

1001
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,990
fast right but you know if If it solves
the problem, you'll get some some

1002
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
the problem, you'll get some some
 

1003
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,950
the problem, you'll get some some
points. You won't get zero points. Yeah.

1004
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
points. You won't get zero points. Yeah.
 

1005
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,789
points. You won't get zero points. Yeah.
Will we get any questions that are like,

1006
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
Will we get any questions that are like,
 

1007
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,630
Will we get any questions that are like,
"How fast can you make this? Make this

1008
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
"How fast can you make this? Make this
 

1009
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,310
"How fast can you make this? Make this
as fast as possible." Yeah. So, a lot of

1010
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
as fast as possible." Yeah. So, a lot of
 

1011
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,710
as fast as possible." Yeah. So, a lot of
times we'll say, "Give us an efficient

1012
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
times we'll say, "Give us an efficient
 

1013
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,590
times we'll say, "Give us an efficient
algorithm." Okay. It's like, "Whoa, I

1014
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
algorithm." Okay. It's like, "Whoa, I
 

1015
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,870
algorithm." Okay. It's like, "Whoa, I
don't know if it's efficient or not."

1016
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
don't know if it's efficient or not."
 

1017
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,470
don't know if it's efficient or not."
Well, that just means that faster

1018
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
Well, that just means that faster
 

1019
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,909
Well, that just means that faster
running times are going to give you more

1020
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
running times are going to give you more
 

1021
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,029
running times are going to give you more
points. Okay. So in in questions like

1022
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
points. Okay. So in in questions like
 

1023
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,549
points. Okay. So in in questions like
that it's mostly uh trying to play this

1024
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
that it's mostly uh trying to play this
 

1025
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,510
that it's mostly uh trying to play this
game of uh usually we'll put an

1026
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
game of uh usually we'll put an
 

1027
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,909
game of uh usually we'll put an
efficient one in not in terms of a data

1028
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
efficient one in not in terms of a data
 

1029
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,990
efficient one in not in terms of a data
structure because usually a data

1030
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
structure because usually a data
 

1031
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,190
structure because usually a data
structures problem it's important in

1032
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
structures problem it's important in
 

1033
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,750
structures problem it's important in
your implementation that these data

1034
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
your implementation that these data
 

1035
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,830
your implementation that these data
structure operations be fast and we want

1036
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
structure operations be fast and we want
 

1037
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,630
structure operations be fast and we want
to tell you that what how fast is right

1038
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
to tell you that what how fast is right
 

1039
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,990
to tell you that what how fast is right
so dynam data structures uh questions in

1040
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
so dynam data structures uh questions in
 

1041
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,390
so dynam data structures uh questions in
general

1042
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
general
 

1043
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,470
general
uh there's usually a trade-off between

1044
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480
uh there's usually a trade-off between
 

1045
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,310
uh there's usually a trade-off between
this the the running times of these

1046
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
this the the running times of these
 

1047
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,149
this the the running times of these
different operations and it's really

1048
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
different operations and it's really
 

1049
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,990
different operations and it's really
important how they relate to each other

1050
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,000
important how they relate to each other
 

1051
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,149
important how they relate to each other
and so for data structures problem it's

1052
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
and so for data structures problem it's
 

1053
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,830
and so for data structures problem it's
kind of about getting those running

1054
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
kind of about getting those running
 

1055
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,630
kind of about getting those running
times okay with an algorithms problem

1056
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
times okay with an algorithms problem
 

1057
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,950
times okay with an algorithms problem
right where we ask you to do one thing

1058
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
right where we ask you to do one thing
 

1059
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,549
right where we ask you to do one thing
right and we try to do as fast as

1060
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
right and we try to do as fast as
 

1061
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,710
right and we try to do as fast as
possible you know try to get linear time

1062
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
possible you know try to get linear time
 

1063
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,630
possible you know try to get linear time
right most of the time you can't get

1064
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
right most of the time you can't get
 

1065
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,510
right most of the time you can't get
better than linear time if you have to

1066
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
better than linear time if you have to
 

1067
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,270
better than linear time if you have to
read the entire input at some point

1068
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
read the entire input at some point
 

1069
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,630
read the entire input at some point
right like if I want to find the things

1070
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
right like if I want to find the things
 

1071
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,430
right like if I want to find the things
in my data Right? And if you can't think

1072
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
in my data Right? And if you can't think
 

1073
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,510
in my data Right? And if you can't think
of a linear time algorithm, you know,

1074
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
of a linear time algorithm, you know,
 

1075
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,270
of a linear time algorithm, you know,
think of an n squ thing or think of an n

1076
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
think of an n squ thing or think of an n
 

1077
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,990
think of an n squ thing or think of an n
login thing, right? Maybe that's a

1078
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
login thing, right? Maybe that's a
 

1079
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,830
login thing, right? Maybe that's a
little hard for you guys to think of

1080
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
little hard for you guys to think of
 

1081
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,390
little hard for you guys to think of
right now, right? But that's why I'm

1082
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
right now, right? But that's why I'm
 

1083
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,029
right now, right? But that's why I'm
saying start with any correct algorithm

1084
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
saying start with any correct algorithm
 

1085
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,549
saying start with any correct algorithm
and then maybe you can optimize, maybe

1086
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
and then maybe you can optimize, maybe
 

1087
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,149
and then maybe you can optimize, maybe
you can use a better data structure to

1088
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
you can use a better data structure to
 

1089
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,430
you can use a better data structure to
make it more efficient. Does that make

1090
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
make it more efficient. Does that make
 

1091
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,870
make it more efficient. Does that make
sense? Any other questions?

1092
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
sense? Any other questions?
 

1093
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,310
sense? Any other questions?
Okay. Uh, moving right along.

1094
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
Okay. Uh, moving right along.
 

1095
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,510
Okay. Uh, moving right along.
Okay. Here's some downsides, right?

1096
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
Okay. Here's some downsides, right?
 

1097
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,830
Okay. Here's some downsides, right?
Okay. If you find yourself doing one of

1098
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
Okay. If you find yourself doing one of
 

1099
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,470
Okay. If you find yourself doing one of
these thing three things,

1100
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
these thing three things,
 

1101
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,070
these thing three things,
take a step back. You're probably doing

1102
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
take a step back. You're probably doing
 

1103
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,710
take a step back. You're probably doing
something wrong. Okay? So, question

1104
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
something wrong. Okay? So, question
 

1105
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,789
something wrong. Okay? So, question
yourself if you're trying to compute

1106
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
yourself if you're trying to compute
 

1107
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,710
yourself if you're trying to compute
decimals, rationals, or real numbers. I

1108
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
decimals, rationals, or real numbers. I
 

1109
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,630
decimals, rationals, or real numbers. I
can't store those things on a I mean, I

1110
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
can't store those things on a I mean, I
 

1111
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,789
can't store those things on a I mean, I
can store decimals to finite precision,

1112
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
can store decimals to finite precision,
 

1113
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,230
can store decimals to finite precision,
right? But if you're doing finite

1114
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
right? But if you're doing finite
 

1115
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,630
right? But if you're doing finite
precision, you might as well round like

1116
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
precision, you might as well round like
 

1117
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,710
precision, you might as well round like
multiply your numbers by that fixed

1118
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
multiply your numbers by that fixed
 

1119
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,350
multiply your numbers by that fixed
precision and deal with integers, right?

1120
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
precision and deal with integers, right?
 

1121
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,950
precision and deal with integers, right?
We only have taught you how to deal with

1122
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960
We only have taught you how to deal with
 

1123
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,710
We only have taught you how to deal with
integers in this class, right? We

1124
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
integers in this class, right? We
 

1125
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,390
integers in this class, right? We
haven't even shown you how to

1126
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,400
haven't even shown you how to
 

1127
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,909
haven't even shown you how to
efficiently compute on rationals and

1128
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
efficiently compute on rationals and
 

1129
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,070
efficiently compute on rationals and
real numbers. We have told you if you

1130
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
real numbers. We have told you if you
 

1131
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,390
real numbers. We have told you if you
have a denominator and a numerator of a

1132
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400
have a denominator and a numerator of a
 

1133
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,510
have a denominator and a numerator of a
fraction, I can take two fractions and

1134
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,520
fraction, I can take two fractions and
 

1135
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,669
fraction, I can take two fractions and
compare them right in constant time by

1136
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
compare them right in constant time by
 

1137
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,230
compare them right in constant time by
doing cross multiplication. But if I'm

1138
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,240
doing cross multiplication. But if I'm
 

1139
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,310
doing cross multiplication. But if I'm
trying to actually do this division,

1140
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
trying to actually do this division,
 

1141
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,110
trying to actually do this division,
right, to arbitrary precision, that's

1142
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
right, to arbitrary precision, that's
 

1143
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,310
right, to arbitrary precision, that's
not that's not happy, right? Because I

1144
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
not that's not happy, right? Because I
 

1145
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,830
not that's not happy, right? Because I
can't even represent that on my computer

1146
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
can't even represent that on my computer
 

1147
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,390
can't even represent that on my computer
in finite number of decimal points for

1148
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
in finite number of decimal points for
 

1149
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,950
in finite number of decimal points for
some of these things, right? Uh if

1150
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
some of these things, right? Uh if
 

1151
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,390
some of these things, right? Uh if
you're trying to use radic sort for

1152
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
you're trying to use radic sort for
 

1153
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,549
you're trying to use radic sort for
every answer, it's probably wrong,

1154
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
every answer, it's probably wrong,
 

1155
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,950
every answer, it's probably wrong,
right? Uh one of the things that we try

1156
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
right? Uh one of the things that we try
 

1157
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,990
right? Uh one of the things that we try
to do on our quizzes, right? that we're

1158
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
to do on our quizzes, right? that we're
 

1159
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,909
to do on our quizzes, right? that we're
not just giving you a bunch of problems

1160
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
not just giving you a bunch of problems
 

1161
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,470
not just giving you a bunch of problems
randomly, right? We probably are making

1162
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
randomly, right? We probably are making
 

1163
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,710
randomly, right? We probably are making
problems that cover the material in some

1164
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
problems that cover the material in some
 

1165
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,029
problems that cover the material in some
way, right? We do want to test you on

1166
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
way, right? We do want to test you on
 

1167
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,310
way, right? We do want to test you on
all of the things, right? And so if uh

1168
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
all of the things, right? And so if uh
 

1169
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,230
all of the things, right? And so if uh
if you find that you're using the same

1170
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
if you find that you're using the same
 

1171
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,510
if you find that you're using the same
thing four or five times on the exam,

1172
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
thing four or five times on the exam,
 

1173
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,590
thing four or five times on the exam,
that might be a sign that you're using

1174
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
that might be a sign that you're using
 

1175
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,149
that might be a sign that you're using
it too many times. It's not all always

1176
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
it too many times. It's not all always
 

1177
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,590
it too many times. It's not all always
the case, right? Sometimes hashing is

1178
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
the case, right? Sometimes hashing is
 

1179
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,270
the case, right? Sometimes hashing is
super useful, right? So you want to use

1180
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
super useful, right? So you want to use
 

1181
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,270
super useful, right? So you want to use
it all the time. But in particular,

1182
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
it all the time. But in particular,
 

1183
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,029
it all the time. But in particular,
right,

1184
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
right,
 

1185
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,190
right,
everyone tries to use radic sort when

1186
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
everyone tries to use radic sort when
 

1187
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,070
everyone tries to use radic sort when
it's inappropriate, right? And they

1188
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
it's inappropriate, right? And they
 

1189
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,909
it's inappropriate, right? And they
love, right, because it gets linear

1190
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
love, right, because it gets linear
 

1191
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,029
love, right, because it gets linear
time, right? But if you if you write

1192
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
time, right? But if you if you write
 

1193
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,789
time, right? But if you if you write
merge sort for something where radic

1194
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
merge sort for something where radic
 

1195
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,630
merge sort for something where radic
sort will apply, you'll get some points

1196
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
sort will apply, you'll get some points
 

1197
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,029
sort will apply, you'll get some points
because it's correct but not efficient,

1198
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
because it's correct but not efficient,
 

1199
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,270
because it's correct but not efficient,
right? If you're

1200
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,280
right? If you're
 

1201
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,430
right? If you're
and it's inefficient by a log factor,

1202
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
and it's inefficient by a log factor,
 

1203
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,789
and it's inefficient by a log factor,
right? If you're trying to use radic

1204
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
right? If you're trying to use radic
 

1205
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,230
right? If you're trying to use radic
sort in a

1206
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
sort in a
 

1207
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,149
sort in a
situation where comparisons are the

1208
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
situation where comparisons are the
 

1209
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,909
situation where comparisons are the
answer and you don't have a bound on the

1210
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
answer and you don't have a bound on the
 

1211
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,470
answer and you don't have a bound on the
integers. If I don't have a bound on the

1212
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
integers. If I don't have a bound on the
 

1213
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,390
integers. If I don't have a bound on the
size of the integers, then this may be

1214
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
size of the integers, then this may be
 

1215
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,590
size of the integers, then this may be
taking huge amount of time, right? So,

1216
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
taking huge amount of time, right? So,
 

1217
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,750
taking huge amount of time, right? So,
I'm going to I'm might not even think of

1218
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm going to I'm might not even think of
 

1219
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,350
I'm going to I'm might not even think of
that as being correct because, you know,

1220
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
that as being correct because, you know,
 

1221
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,909
that as being correct because, you know,
it could be exponential time, right? Or

1222
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919
it could be exponential time, right? Or
 

1223
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,190
it could be exponential time, right? Or
it could I mean I don't know I don't

1224
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
it could I mean I don't know I don't
 

1225
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,710
it could I mean I don't know I don't
know how big my word size is. It could

1226
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
know how big my word size is. It could
 

1227
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,710
know how big my word size is. It could
be arbitrarily bad. Okay. Uh, and then

1228
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
be arbitrarily bad. Okay. Uh, and then
 

1229
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,710
be arbitrarily bad. Okay. Uh, and then
if you're trying to augment a binary

1230
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:34,720
if you're trying to augment a binary
 

1231
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,630
if you're trying to augment a binary
tree with something that's not a subtree

1232
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
tree with something that's not a subtree
 

1233
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,390
tree with something that's not a subtree
property, right? Something that can't be

1234
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
property, right? Something that can't be
 

1235
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,710
property, right? Something that can't be
computed from the augmentations of its

1236
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
computed from the augmentations of its
 

1237
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,470
computed from the augmentations of its
two children, you're doing something

1238
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
two children, you're doing something
 

1239
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,190
two children, you're doing something
bad. I every exam we have 30% of

1240
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
bad. I every exam we have 30% of
 

1241
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,390
bad. I every exam we have 30% of
students say augment by my index

1242
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
students say augment by my index
 

1243
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,950
students say augment by my index
in the entire tree,

1244
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
in the entire tree,
 

1245
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,390
in the entire tree,
right? Or augment by

1246
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
right? Or augment by
 

1247
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,190
right? Or augment by
here's one that's fun. uh augment by the

1248
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
here's one that's fun. uh augment by the
 

1249
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,070
here's one that's fun. uh augment by the
things the size of my left subree.

1250
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080

 

1251
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,390

Okay, how like the number of nodes in my

1252
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
Okay, how like the number of nodes in my
 

1253
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,510
Okay, how like the number of nodes in my
left subree? How can I

1254
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520

 

1255
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,549

how I'm not sure how I can maintain that

1256
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
how I'm not sure how I can maintain that
 

1257
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,310
how I'm not sure how I can maintain that
with rotations and things like that? Uh

1258
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
with rotations and things like that? Uh
 

1259
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,350
with rotations and things like that? Uh
let's see to in order for me to keep

1260
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,360
let's see to in order for me to keep
 

1261
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,669
let's see to in order for me to keep
track of the augmentation of my left

1262
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
track of the augmentation of my left
 

1263
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,350
track of the augmentation of my left
tree from the augmentation of my left

1264
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
tree from the augmentation of my left
 

1265
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,430
tree from the augmentation of my left
tree, right? I kind of have to do a

1266
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,440
tree, right? I kind of have to do a
 

1267
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,029
tree, right? I kind of have to do a
logarithmic walk all the way down the

1268
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
logarithmic walk all the way down the
 

1269
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,549
logarithmic walk all the way down the
thing to figure out how many things were

1270
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
thing to figure out how many things were
 

1271
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,149
thing to figure out how many things were
there, right? So that's not a

1272
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:36,159
there, right? So that's not a
 

1273
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,750
there, right? So that's not a
maintainable thing in constant time. If

1274
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
maintainable thing in constant time. If
 

1275
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,269
maintainable thing in constant time. If
I want to augment something of my left

1276
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
I want to augment something of my left
 

1277
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,909
I want to augment something of my left
subree, just augment the thing itself

1278
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
subree, just augment the thing itself
 

1279
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,070
subree, just augment the thing itself
and just look at your left subree and

1280
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
and just look at your left subree and
 

1281
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,750
and just look at your left subree and
look at its augmentation. Does that make

1282
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
look at its augmentation. Does that make
 

1283
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,590
look at its augmentation. Does that make
sense? Yeah.

1284
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
sense? Yeah.
 

1285
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,269
sense? Yeah.
If you had say augmented it with a sub

1286
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
If you had say augmented it with a sub
 

1287
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,350
If you had say augmented it with a sub
tree and then augmented again with left

1288
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
tree and then augmented again with left
 

1289
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,269
tree and then augmented again with left
subree and then use you could do that

1290
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
subree and then use you could do that
 

1291
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,029
subree and then use you could do that
still count as you could do that. Yeah.

1292
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
still count as you could do that. Yeah.
 

1293
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,710
still count as you could do that. Yeah.
So you could do that in constant time by

1294
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
So you could do that in constant time by
 

1295
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,669
So you could do that in constant time by
augmenting by subree size, right? Yeah.

1296
00:25:59,669 --> 00:25:59,679
augmenting by subree size, right? Yeah.
 

1297
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,269
augmenting by subree size, right? Yeah.
Then have another augmentation in the

1298
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:01,279
Then have another augmentation in the
 

1299
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,549
Then have another augmentation in the
thing. You could have another

1300
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
thing. You could have another
 

1301
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,830
thing. You could have another
augmentation because then you could just

1302
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
augmentation because then you could just
 

1303
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,990
augmentation because then you could just
look at but then just look look at your

1304
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
look at but then just look look at your
 

1305
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,870
look at but then just look look at your
left subree please. Yeah. No no reason

1306
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
left subree please. Yeah. No no reason
 

1307
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,549
left subree please. Yeah. No no reason
to store it again, right? You just do

1308
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
to store it again, right? You just do
 

1309
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,950
to store it again, right? You just do
one constant time look to your left,

1310
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
one constant time look to your left,
 

1311
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,350
one constant time look to your left,
right? Okay. Don't do that. Okay. So

1312
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
right? Okay. Don't do that. Okay. So
 

1313
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,789
right? Okay. Don't do that. Okay. So
that is cool. I'm not that far behind.

1314
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:20,799
that is cool. I'm not that far behind.
 

1315
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,029
that is cool. I'm not that far behind.
Those are my tips on solving

1316
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
Those are my tips on solving
 

1317
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,950
Those are my tips on solving
questions. Oh, there's one more page.

1318
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
questions. Oh, there's one more page.
 

1319
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,750
questions. Oh, there's one more page.
Yeah. So like defining an augmentation

1320
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
Yeah. So like defining an augmentation
 

1321
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,669
Yeah. So like defining an augmentation
to give a formula and like argue that

1322
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679
to give a formula and like argue that
 

1323
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,750
to give a formula and like argue that
it's exactly right. So the the idea is

1324
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
it's exactly right. So the the idea is
 

1325
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,029
it's exactly right. So the the idea is
if you give an augmentation that's not

1326
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
if you give an augmentation that's not
 

1327
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,149
if you give an augmentation that's not
uh stand like we're going to talk about

1328
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
uh stand like we're going to talk about
 

1329
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,230
uh stand like we're going to talk about
our standard things you can reduce to in

1330
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
our standard things you can reduce to in
 

1331
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,669
our standard things you can reduce to in
a second, right? If I if you're saying

1332
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
a second, right? If I if you're saying
 

1333
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,549
a second, right? If I if you're saying
I'm going to take a set AVL tree, right,

1334
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,559
I'm going to take a set AVL tree, right,
 

1335
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,590
I'm going to take a set AVL tree, right,
or a sequence AVL tree and like for

1336
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
or a sequence AVL tree and like for
 

1337
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,430
or a sequence AVL tree and like for
example at the end of lecture, we were

1338
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
example at the end of lecture, we were
 

1339
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,549
example at the end of lecture, we were
talking about how a sequence AVL tree

1340
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
talking about how a sequence AVL tree
 

1341
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,390
talking about how a sequence AVL tree
could be modified to support priority Q

1342
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
could be modified to support priority Q
 

1343
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,549
could be modified to support priority Q
operations in the same running times as

1344
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
operations in the same running times as
 

1345
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,669
operations in the same running times as
binary heaps, right? And that was saying

1346
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
binary heaps, right? And that was saying
 

1347
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,390
binary heaps, right? And that was saying
we store our subree maxes, right? The

1348
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,400
we store our subree maxes, right? The
 

1349
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,029
we store our subree maxes, right? The
max thing in my subree, right? Uh, and

1350
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,039
max thing in my subree, right? Uh, and
 

1351
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,789
max thing in my subree, right? Uh, and
so that's a different augmentation than

1352
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
so that's a different augmentation than
 

1353
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,510
so that's a different augmentation than
what's already augmented on the sequence

1354
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
what's already augmented on the sequence
 

1355
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,510
what's already augmented on the sequence
AVL tree. What's what what are the

1356
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,520
AVL tree. What's what what are the
 

1357
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,549
AVL tree. What's what what are the
augmentations on a sequence AVL tree?

1358
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:26,559

 

1359
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,870

Size.

1360
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
Size.
 

1361
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,789
Size.
Uh, so count is the same thing as how

1362
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:30,799
Uh, so count is the same thing as how
 

1363
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,510
Uh, so count is the same thing as how
many nodes are in my subree and height,

1364
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,520
many nodes are in my subree and height,
 

1365
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,390
many nodes are in my subree and height,
right? Because it's an AVL tree, right?

1366
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:36,400
right? Because it's an AVL tree, right?
 

1367
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,110
right? Because it's an AVL tree, right?
Uh so if I'm augmenting by max in my

1368
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,120
Uh so if I'm augmenting by max in my
 

1369
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,710
Uh so if I'm augmenting by max in my
subree

1370
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
subree
 

1371
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,190
subree
that's not part of my standard interface

1372
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
that's not part of my standard interface
 

1373
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,029
that's not part of my standard interface
so you need to tell me that right even

1374
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
so you need to tell me that right even
 

1375
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,390
so you need to tell me that right even
though we've done it before it should be

1376
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:46,400
though we've done it before it should be
 

1377
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,470
though we've done it before it should be
very easy for you right just say I'm

1378
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
very easy for you right just say I'm
 

1379
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,430
very easy for you right just say I'm
augmenting by my max can be computed as

1380
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
augmenting by my max can be computed as
 

1381
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,149
augmenting by my max can be computed as
the max between me and my left and right

1382
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
the max between me and my left and right
 

1383
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,110
the max between me and my left and right
subree if they exist done right but just

1384
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
subree if they exist done right but just
 

1385
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,590
subree if they exist done right but just
do that right you have to tell me and

1386
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
do that right you have to tell me and
 

1387
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,750
do that right you have to tell me and
and it takes constant time so it can be

1388
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:01,760
and it takes constant time so it can be
 

1389
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,070
and it takes constant time so it can be
maintained in constant time when I'm

1390
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
maintained in constant time when I'm
 

1391
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,909
maintained in constant time when I'm
doing my stuff does that make sense

1392
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919

 

1393
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,870

Okay. So, uh the last thing I guess

1394
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
Okay. So, uh the last thing I guess
 

1395
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,630
Okay. So, uh the last thing I guess
especially on the data structures

1396
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:12,640
especially on the data structures
 

1397
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,389
especially on the data structures
problems um I would suggest that you

1398
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
problems um I would suggest that you
 

1399
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,350
problems um I would suggest that you
approach these things by by solving

1400
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
approach these things by by solving
 

1401
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,269
approach these things by by solving
these problems just in terms of the

1402
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
these problems just in terms of the
 

1403
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,950
these problems just in terms of the
interfaces

1404
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
interfaces
 

1405
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,110
interfaces
first, right? Because then at least you

1406
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
first, right? Because then at least you
 

1407
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,750
first, right? Because then at least you
get something that's correct, right? And

1408
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
get something that's correct, right? And
 

1409
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,710
get something that's correct, right? And
then choose the algorithms or data

1410
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
then choose the algorithms or data
 

1411
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,549
then choose the algorithms or data
structures that you use to implement

1412
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:32,559
structures that you use to implement
 

1413
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,590
structures that you use to implement
those interfaces afterwards, right? one

1414
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:35,600
those interfaces afterwards, right? one
 

1415
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,430
those interfaces afterwards, right? one
gets you to a correct algorithm, the

1416
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
gets you to a correct algorithm, the
 

1417
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,110
gets you to a correct algorithm, the
other is for efficiency. Right?

1418
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
other is for efficiency. Right?
 

1419
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,110
other is for efficiency. Right?
Decoupling these might help you in

1420
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,120
Decoupling these might help you in
 

1421
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,190
Decoupling these might help you in
solving the problem. If if it doesn't

1422
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
solving the problem. If if it doesn't
 

1423
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,669
solving the problem. If if it doesn't
help you, don't. Right? Right. If if

1424
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:45,679
help you, don't. Right? Right. If if
 

1425
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,750
help you, don't. Right? Right. If if
you're like, whenever I see a set data

1426
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:47,760
you're like, whenever I see a set data
 

1427
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,750
you're like, whenever I see a set data
structure, I'm going to probably use a

1428
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
structure, I'm going to probably use a
 

1429
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,669
structure, I'm going to probably use a
hash table, that's probably fine, right?

1430
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
hash table, that's probably fine, right?
 

1431
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,350
hash table, that's probably fine, right?
But if we're looking for worstase time

1432
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
But if we're looking for worstase time
 

1433
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,350
But if we're looking for worstase time
bounds, that's probably not fine, right?

1434
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,360
bounds, that's probably not fine, right?
 

1435
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,350
bounds, that's probably not fine, right?
So you just

1436
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,360
So you just
 

1437
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,470
So you just
you I'm I'm ask I'm suggesting that you

1438
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,480
you I'm I'm ask I'm suggesting that you
 

1439
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,350
you I'm I'm ask I'm suggesting that you
separate these things uh so that you

1440
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360
separate these things uh so that you
 

1441
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,950
separate these things uh so that you
concentrate on solving the problem first

1442
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
concentrate on solving the problem first
 

1443
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,350
concentrate on solving the problem first
and optimize it later. Yeah. Just a

1444
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
and optimize it later. Yeah. Just a
 

1445
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,110
and optimize it later. Yeah. Just a
question in regards to worst case time

1446
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
question in regards to worst case time
 

1447
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,590
question in regards to worst case time
bound. Um so for our hash table given

1448
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
bound. Um so for our hash table given
 

1449
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,230
bound. Um so for our hash table given
that it's like oh one expected like that

1450
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,240
that it's like oh one expected like that
 

1451
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,470
that it's like oh one expected like that
also implies that oh worst case. So

1452
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
also implies that oh worst case. So
 

1453
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,149
also implies that oh worst case. So
could you technically it doesn't imply

1454
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:22,159
could you technically it doesn't imply
 

1455
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,029
could you technically it doesn't imply
that it is that right? So that I mean

1456
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
that it is that right? So that I mean
 

1457
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,870
that it is that right? So that I mean
you could have a data structure whose

1458
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
you could have a data structure whose
 

1459
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,350
you could have a data structure whose
expected time bound is constant but its

1460
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,360
expected time bound is constant but its
 

1461
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,669
expected time bound is constant but its
worst case bound is n log n right it

1462
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
worst case bound is n log n right it
 

1463
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,909
worst case bound is n log n right it
just happens to be the fact that for a

1464
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
just happens to be the fact that for a
 

1465
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,070
just happens to be the fact that for a
hash table those worst case operations

1466
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,080
hash table those worst case operations
 

1467
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,350
hash table those worst case operations
are linear right so but if I had we had

1468
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
are linear right so but if I had we had
 

1469
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,750
are linear right so but if I had we had
a question uh up here beforehand right

1470
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
a question uh up here beforehand right
 

1471
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,630
a question uh up here beforehand right
if I had a a running time bound that I

1472
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
if I had a a running time bound that I
 

1473
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,430
if I had a a running time bound that I
did something to a hash table right in

1474
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
did something to a hash table right in
 

1475
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,149
did something to a hash table right in
constant expected time right I did a

1476
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:50,159
constant expected time right I did a
 

1477
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,230
constant expected time right I did a
lookup and then I I I queried an AV VL

1478
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,240
lookup and then I I I queried an AV VL
 

1479
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,230
lookup and then I I I queried an AV VL
tree for the predecessor of a node or

1480
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,240
tree for the predecessor of a node or
 

1481
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,350
tree for the predecessor of a node or
something like that and I did that in O

1482
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
something like that and I did that in O
 

1483
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,470
something like that and I did that in O
of log N time

1484
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
of log N time
 

1485
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,230
of log N time
what's the worst case running time of

1486
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,240
what's the worst case running time of
 

1487
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,549
what's the worst case running time of
that O of N right what's the expected

1488
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
that O of N right what's the expected
 

1489
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,510
that O of N right what's the expected
running time of this thing

1490
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
running time of this thing
 

1491
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,630
running time of this thing
log N expected login right because it's

1492
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
log N expected login right because it's
 

1493
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,070
log N expected login right because it's
possible that in the worst case it could

1494
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
possible that in the worst case it could
 

1495
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,029
possible that in the worst case it could
be higher that make sense

1496
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,039
be higher that make sense
 

1497
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,190
be higher that make sense
okay

1498
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
okay
 

1499
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,950
okay
uh

1500
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
uh
 

1501
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,830
uh
Uh so okay the second bullet is just

1502
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:27,840
Uh so okay the second bullet is just
 

1503
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,430
Uh so okay the second bullet is just
setting up a data structures problem

1504
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
setting up a data structures problem
 

1505
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,190
setting up a data structures problem
right there's a lot of moving parts

1506
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
right there's a lot of moving parts
 

1507
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,789
right there's a lot of moving parts
we're going to do two data structures

1508
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
we're going to do two data structures
 

1509
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,990
we're going to do two data structures
problem at the end of this session right

1510
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
problem at the end of this session right
 

1511
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,310
problem at the end of this session right
describe all of the data structures

1512
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
describe all of the data structures
 

1513
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,190
describe all of the data structures
you're using right

1514
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200
you're using right
 

1515
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,789
you're using right
including what they store right if

1516
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:42,799
including what they store right if
 

1517
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,789
including what they store right if
you're storing a set data structure you

1518
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
you're storing a set data structure you
 

1519
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,470
you're storing a set data structure you
better tell me what the things you're

1520
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
better tell me what the things you're
 

1521
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,990
better tell me what the things you're
stored are keyed on right usually the

1522
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
stored are keyed on right usually the
 

1523
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,750
stored are keyed on right usually the
things that we're storing contain a

1524
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
things that we're storing contain a
 

1525
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,510
things that we're storing contain a
bunch of information. And if you just

1526
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520
bunch of information. And if you just
 

1527
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,310
bunch of information. And if you just
say I'm storing all of the toppings of

1528
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
say I'm storing all of the toppings of
 

1529
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,750
say I'm storing all of the toppings of
my pizza, right, in a set data structure

1530
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
my pizza, right, in a set data structure
 

1531
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,990
my pizza, right, in a set data structure
and that's all you tell me, I have no

1532
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000
and that's all you tell me, I have no
 

1533
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,350
and that's all you tell me, I have no
idea what you're talking about because I

1534
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
idea what you're talking about because I
 

1535
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,549
idea what you're talking about because I
don't know what the semantics of your

1536
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:04,559
don't know what the semantics of your
 

1537
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,990
don't know what the semantics of your
set data structure are. What is it keyed

1538
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
set data structure are. What is it keyed
 

1539
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,230
set data structure are. What is it keyed
on? Right? I have to say, oh, it's keyed

1540
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
on? Right? I have to say, oh, it's keyed
 

1541
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,350
on? Right? I have to say, oh, it's keyed
on, I don't know, the wise or something

1542
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
on, I don't know, the wise or something
 

1543
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,230
on, I don't know, the wise or something
like that, right?

1544
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,240
like that, right?
 

1545
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,149
like that, right?
Okay. And they're invariance, right?

1546
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
Okay. And they're invariance, right?
 

1547
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,070
Okay. And they're invariance, right?
what how we're setting up these data

1548
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
what how we're setting up these data
 

1549
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,710
what how we're setting up these data
structures problem usually how I solve

1550
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
structures problem usually how I solve
 

1551
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,350
structures problem usually how I solve
these when I'm writing the solutions I

1552
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,360
these when I'm writing the solutions I
 

1553
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,350
these when I'm writing the solutions I
set you up a state right of what this

1554
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,360
set you up a state right of what this
 

1555
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,269
set you up a state right of what this
data structure could be at some instance

1556
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
data structure could be at some instance
 

1557
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,510
data structure could be at some instance
right I'm going to say this data

1558
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,520
right I'm going to say this data
 

1559
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,430
right I'm going to say this data
structure stores all of the things less

1560
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
structure stores all of the things less
 

1561
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,470
structure stores all of the things less
than K with with key less than K blah

1562
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
than K with with key less than K blah
 

1563
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,509
than K with with key less than K blah
blah blah right and this one stores the

1564
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
blah blah right and this one stores the
 

1565
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,669
blah blah right and this one stores the
uh the exttrinsic order of the items

1566
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:43,679
uh the exttrinsic order of the items
 

1567
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,870
uh the exttrinsic order of the items
based on blah blah blah right Okay, so

1568
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:46,880
based on blah blah blah right Okay, so
 

1569
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,190
based on blah blah blah right Okay, so
actually me stating what they store in

1570
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,200
actually me stating what they store in
 

1571
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,509
actually me stating what they store in
that way, right, is actually imposing

1572
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
that way, right, is actually imposing
 

1573
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,750
that way, right, is actually imposing
some kind of invariant on these data

1574
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
some kind of invariant on these data
 

1575
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,430
some kind of invariant on these data
structures that I'm wanting to maintain,

1576
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
structures that I'm wanting to maintain,
 

1577
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,990
structures that I'm wanting to maintain,
right? But what I need to do to prove

1578
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
right? But what I need to do to prove
 

1579
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,789
right? But what I need to do to prove
that this thing is correct is that based

1580
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
that this thing is correct is that based
 

1581
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,750
that this thing is correct is that based
on the assumption that those invariants

1582
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
on the assumption that those invariants
 

1583
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,830
on the assumption that those invariants
held before my operation, right?

1584
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:07,840
held before my operation, right?
 

1585
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,590
held before my operation, right?
then I can prove that an operation is

1586
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
then I can prove that an operation is
 

1587
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,990
then I can prove that an operation is
correct if all of those ma those those

1588
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
correct if all of those ma those those
 

1589
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,590
correct if all of those ma those those
invariants are maintained at before then

1590
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
invariants are maintained at before then
 

1591
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,509
invariants are maintained at before then
after the operation right that's kind of

1592
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
after the operation right that's kind of
 

1593
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,269
after the operation right that's kind of
how I'm proving that this thing is

1594
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
how I'm proving that this thing is
 

1595
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,029
how I'm proving that this thing is
correct and then when I'm querying I'm

1596
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:21,039
correct and then when I'm querying I'm
 

1597
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,870
correct and then when I'm querying I'm
doing some kind of lookup on this data

1598
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:22,880
doing some kind of lookup on this data
 

1599
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,350
doing some kind of lookup on this data
structure I can rely on those invariants

1600
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
structure I can rely on those invariants
 

1601
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,509
structure I can rely on those invariants
I know that those things are good right

1602
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:27,519
I know that those things are good right
 

1603
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,070
I know that those things are good right
those things have been maintained and so

1604
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
those things have been maintained and so
 

1605
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,470
those things have been maintained and so
I can rely on those to look up uh what's

1606
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,480
I can rely on those to look up uh what's
 

1607
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,710
I can rely on those to look up uh what's
the largest K of this thing does that

1608
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
the largest K of this thing does that
 

1609
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,110
the largest K of this thing does that
kind of make sense abstract we're going

1610
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
kind of make sense abstract we're going
 

1611
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,830
kind of make sense abstract we're going
get a little bit more concrete in just a

1612
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:39,840
get a little bit more concrete in just a
 

1613
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,029
get a little bit more concrete in just a
second. Uh and then uh implement every

1614
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
second. Uh and then uh implement every
 

1615
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,509
second. Uh and then uh implement every
operation. I you have no idea how many

1616
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:45,519
operation. I you have no idea how many
 

1617
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,149
operation. I you have no idea how many
solutions we write read on the quizzes,

1618
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
solutions we write read on the quizzes,
 

1619
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,110
solutions we write read on the quizzes,
right? Which we give you three

1620
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,120
right? Which we give you three
 

1621
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,070
right? Which we give you three
operations to implement and you don't

1622
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
operations to implement and you don't
 

1623
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,470
operations to implement and you don't
even mention one and it's usually the

1624
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
even mention one and it's usually the
 

1625
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,549
even mention one and it's usually the
easiest one. It's like insert it into

1626
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
easiest one. It's like insert it into
 

1627
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,870
easiest one. It's like insert it into
your data structure. It's like come on

1628
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
your data structure. It's like come on
 

1629
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,870
your data structure. It's like come on
just say that right? We can't give you

1630
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:02,880
just say that right? We can't give you
 

1631
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,389
just say that right? We can't give you
points unless you mention that

1632
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
points unless you mention that
 

1633
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,669
points unless you mention that
operation. Does that make sense? Uh, and

1634
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
operation. Does that make sense? Uh, and
 

1635
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,630
operation. Does that make sense? Uh, and
then it's going to help us re happy

1636
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
then it's going to help us re happy
 

1637
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,750
then it's going to help us re happy
graders give you more points. Not not

1638
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:13,760
graders give you more points. Not not
 

1639
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,630
graders give you more points. Not not
really, right? Like, but I if your

1640
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
really, right? Like, but I if your
 

1641
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,750
really, right? Like, but I if your
solution is well organized and wellleled

1642
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:19,760
solution is well organized and wellleled
 

1643
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,149
solution is well organized and wellleled
and things like that, then we're going

1644
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:22,159
and things like that, then we're going
 

1645
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,710
and things like that, then we're going
to be able to comprehend your solution

1646
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720
to be able to comprehend your solution
 

1647
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,070
to be able to comprehend your solution
better and we'll be able to give you

1648
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
better and we'll be able to give you
 

1649
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,430
better and we'll be able to give you
more points. Remember, part of this

1650
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
more points. Remember, part of this
 

1651
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,029
more points. Remember, part of this
class is about communication. If your

1652
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
class is about communication. If your
 

1653
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,310
class is about communication. If your
thing is correct,

1654
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,320
thing is correct,
 

1655
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,029
thing is correct,
but we can't tell what you're saying,

1656
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
but we can't tell what you're saying,
 

1657
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,630
but we can't tell what you're saying,
then it's not correct. Right.

1658
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,640
then it's not correct. Right.
 

1659
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,149
then it's not correct. Right.
Right.

1660
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:42,159
Right.
 

1661
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,389
Right.
Okay.

1662
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:44,399
Okay.
 

1663
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,590
Okay.
All right. So, uh, now we get to any

1664
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
All right. So, uh, now we get to any
 

1665
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,990
All right. So, uh, now we get to any
questions on that? Yeah. Question about

1666
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,000
questions on that? Yeah. Question about
 

1667
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,070
questions on that? Yeah. Question about
the variance. So, what are the data

1668
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,080
the variance. So, what are the data
 

1669
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,509
the variance. So, what are the data
structures that we've discussed in the

1670
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:53,519
structures that we've discussed in the
 

1671
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,110
structures that we've discussed in the
past? Do you still like what the

1672
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
past? Do you still like what the
 

1673
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,230
past? Do you still like what the
variants are like that tree? Right. So

1674
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,240
variants are like that tree? Right. So
 

1675
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,230
variants are like that tree? Right. So
if it's the standard things we're going

1676
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
if it's the standard things we're going
 

1677
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,669
if it's the standard things we're going
to talk about what the standard things

1678
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
to talk about what the standard things
 

1679
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,509
to talk about what the standard things
are now uh then you don't need to

1680
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:05,519
are now uh then you don't need to
 

1681
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,230
are now uh then you don't need to
reargue or restate all I mean you can

1682
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,240
reargue or restate all I mean you can
 

1683
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,750
reargue or restate all I mean you can
you can basically say like uh because

1684
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:11,760
you can basically say like uh because
 

1685
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,629
you can basically say like uh because
the set and sequence interfaces are

1686
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
the set and sequence interfaces are
 

1687
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,069
the set and sequence interfaces are
defined that way these things are

1688
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:16,079
defined that way these things are
 

1689
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,430
defined that way these things are
correct like almost like ob you can you

1690
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,440
correct like almost like ob you can you
 

1691
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,349
correct like almost like ob you can you
can basically

1692
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
can basically
 

1693
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,069
can basically
we you're trying to convince us that you

1694
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
we you're trying to convince us that you
 

1695
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,310
we you're trying to convince us that you
know why it's correct right if you guys

1696
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
know why it's correct right if you guys
 

1697
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,149
know why it's correct right if you guys
if you're correctly using a set or a

1698
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
if you're correctly using a set or a
 

1699
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,990
if you're correctly using a set or a
sequence data structure in these data

1700
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,000
sequence data structure in these data
 

1701
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,190
sequence data structure in these data
structures type problems then unless

1702
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,200
structures type problems then unless
 

1703
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,790
structures type problems then unless
you're using it in a way that is unusual

1704
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:36,800
you're using it in a way that is unusual
 

1705
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,069
you're using it in a way that is unusual
right uh usually you can just rely on

1706
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079
right uh usually you can just rely on
 

1707
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,149
right uh usually you can just rely on
the properties of the set and sequence

1708
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:42,159
the properties of the set and sequence
 

1709
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,470
the properties of the set and sequence
data structures that we gave you I do

1710
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
data structures that we gave you I do
 

1711
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,909
data structures that we gave you I do
want you to mention that you thought

1712
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
want you to mention that you thought
 

1713
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,589
want you to mention that you thought
about correctness right right like this

1714
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
about correctness right right like this
 

1715
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,190
about correctness right right like this
um

1716
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,200
um
 

1717
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,990
um
this data structure is correct because

1718
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
this data structure is correct because
 

1719
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,230
this data structure is correct because
right just write a sentence saying that

1720
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
right just write a sentence saying that
 

1721
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,470
right just write a sentence saying that
right and arguing that you're you're

1722
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
right and arguing that you're you're
 

1723
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,230
right and arguing that you're you're
basically maintaining the invariance of

1724
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
basically maintaining the invariance of
 

1725
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,230
basically maintaining the invariance of
your data structure kind of at the upper

1726
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,240
your data structure kind of at the upper
 

1727
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,390
your data structure kind of at the upper
level, right? What kinds of things are

1728
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
level, right? What kinds of things are
 

1729
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,870
level, right? What kinds of things are
is this data structure storing? What

1730
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
is this data structure storing? What
 

1731
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,870
is this data structure storing? What
what m uh things about the the global

1732
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
what m uh things about the the global
 

1733
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,910
what m uh things about the the global
data structure are are we relying on to

1734
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
data structure are are we relying on to
 

1735
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,670
data structure are are we relying on to
make query operations? As long as you

1736
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,680
make query operations? As long as you
 

1737
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,030
make query operations? As long as you
are are convincing that uh after a

1738
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
are are convincing that uh after a
 

1739
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,109
are are convincing that uh after a
dynamic operation where I'm modifying

1740
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:23,119
dynamic operation where I'm modifying
 

1741
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,349
dynamic operation where I'm modifying
the data structure that those invariants

1742
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
the data structure that those invariants
 

1743
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,589
the data structure that those invariants
stay the same that are are still

1744
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:27,599
stay the same that are are still
 

1745
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,109
stay the same that are are still
satisfied

1746
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
satisfied
 

1747
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,030
satisfied
then then that's really all you need to

1748
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
then then that's really all you need to
 

1749
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,310
then then that's really all you need to
say right you these these invariants are

1750
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,320
say right you these these invariants are
 

1751
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,430
say right you these these invariants are
are satisfied because of the definitions

1752
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
are satisfied because of the definitions
 

1753
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,109
are satisfied because of the definitions
of a set and sequence data structure

1754
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:39,119
of a set and sequence data structure
 

1755
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,870
of a set and sequence data structure
right like a lot of times it doesn't

1756
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
right like a lot of times it doesn't
 

1757
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,670
right like a lot of times it doesn't
require a lot of thought for the we're

1758
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:43,680
require a lot of thought for the we're
 

1759
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,990
require a lot of thought for the we're
not asking the the reason why we do

1760
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,000
not asking the the reason why we do
 

1761
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,710
not asking the the reason why we do
reduction problems, right? Is so that

1762
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
reduction problems, right? Is so that
 

1763
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,470
reduction problems, right? Is so that
you don't have to do a lot of work to

1764
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,480
you don't have to do a lot of work to
 

1765
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,630
you don't have to do a lot of work to
prove to us that it's correct, right? We

1766
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
prove to us that it's correct, right? We
 

1767
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,870
prove to us that it's correct, right? We
have these really nice black boxes. They

1768
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:54,880
have these really nice black boxes. They
 

1769
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,030
have these really nice black boxes. They
are correct. We proved them to you that

1770
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040
are correct. We proved them to you that
 

1771
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,870
are correct. We proved them to you that
they're correct. And so you don't have

1772
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:58,880
they're correct. And so you don't have
 

1773
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,230
they're correct. And so you don't have
to redo that work. Okay? So now we're

1774
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
to redo that work. Okay? So now we're
 

1775
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,950
to redo that work. Okay? So now we're
going to go through

1776
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:04,960
going to go through
 

1777
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,589
going to go through
uh kind of the core material I like to

1778
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:07,599
uh kind of the core material I like to
 

1779
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,670
uh kind of the core material I like to
think about in this class. this class

1780
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:09,680
think about in this class. this class
 

1781
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,349
think about in this class. this class
the the first part of this class aside

1782
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:11,359
the the first part of this class aside
 

1783
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,710
the the first part of this class aside
from these you know mathematical

1784
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
from these you know mathematical
 

1785
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,510
from these you know mathematical
uh uh tools that we developed at the

1786
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
uh uh tools that we developed at the
 

1787
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,950
uh uh tools that we developed at the
beginning of the course is mostly about

1788
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:18,960
beginning of the course is mostly about
 

1789
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,790
beginning of the course is mostly about
solving problems involving data

1790
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
solving problems involving data
 

1791
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,270
solving problems involving data
structures and we motivated this problem

1792
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,280
structures and we motivated this problem
 

1793
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,829
structures and we motivated this problem
of sorting by saying that a sorted array

1794
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
of sorting by saying that a sorted array
 

1795
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,430
of sorting by saying that a sorted array
is a data structure that's actually

1796
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
is a data structure that's actually
 

1797
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,670
is a data structure that's actually
pretty useful right but how do we sort

1798
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
pretty useful right but how do we sort
 

1799
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,230
pretty useful right but how do we sort
those things uh well we showed you a

1800
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
those things uh well we showed you a
 

1801
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,349
those things uh well we showed you a
bunch of ways to do that right

1802
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
bunch of ways to do that right
 

1803
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,550
bunch of ways to do that right
and this is that nice table lots of

1804
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:38,560
and this is that nice table lots of
 

1805
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,670
and this is that nice table lots of
stuff, right? Why do we show you so many

1806
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,680
stuff, right? Why do we show you so many
 

1807
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,950
stuff, right? Why do we show you so many
sorting algorithms? Why don't we just

1808
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960
sorting algorithms? Why don't we just
 

1809
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,829
sorting algorithms? Why don't we just
give you one algorithm?

1810
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:45,839
give you one algorithm?
 

1811
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,270
give you one algorithm?
H

1812
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280

 

1813
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,270

different run times. Better for

1814
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,280
different run times. Better for
 

1815
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,550
different run times. Better for
different scenario. Better for different

1816
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
different scenario. Better for different
 

1817
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,069
different scenario. Better for different
scenarios. Yeah, they each have their

1818
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:54,079
scenarios. Yeah, they each have their
 

1819
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,670
scenarios. Yeah, they each have their
own individual components that may be

1820
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
own individual components that may be
 

1821
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,630
own individual components that may be
better. Yeah, you'll notice in this

1822
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:58,640
better. Yeah, you'll notice in this
 

1823
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,069
better. Yeah, you'll notice in this
table, right, there's not blue all the

1824
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,079
table, right, there's not blue all the
 

1825
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,990
table, right, there's not blue all the
way across for any of these things,

1826
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
way across for any of these things,
 

1827
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,790
way across for any of these things,
right? So, some of them are better for

1828
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:06,800
right? So, some of them are better for
 

1829
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,630
right? So, some of them are better for
different scenarios. And actually these

1830
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,640
different scenarios. And actually these
 

1831
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,990
different scenarios. And actually these
comments kind of list some special cases

1832
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,000
comments kind of list some special cases
 

1833
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,670
comments kind of list some special cases
where these things might be better.

1834
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:13,680
where these things might be better.
 

1835
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,030
where these things might be better.
Right? In in actuality this ultra blue

1836
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
Right? In in actuality this ultra blue
 

1837
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,910
Right? In in actuality this ultra blue
thing is saying like this could be

1838
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:19,920
thing is saying like this could be
 

1839
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,630
thing is saying like this could be
linear time that's better. Right? But in

1840
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:22,640
linear time that's better. Right? But in
 

1841
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,470
linear time that's better. Right? But in
some cases this is worse than all the

1842
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
some cases this is worse than all the
 

1843
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,310
some cases this is worse than all the
other things. Right? So be a little wary

1844
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
other things. Right? So be a little wary
 

1845
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,150
other things. Right? So be a little wary
of this blue color here. Okay. Generally

1846
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
of this blue color here. Okay. Generally
 

1847
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,630
of this blue color here. Okay. Generally
we're trying to get you down further

1848
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:34,640
we're trying to get you down further
 

1849
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,910
we're trying to get you down further
down in this chart if you can. Right?

1850
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
down in this chart if you can. Right?
 

1851
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,710
down in this chart if you can. Right?
And in general

1852
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
And in general
 

1853
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,950
And in general
uh like for example merge sort, AVL sort

1854
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:44,960
uh like for example merge sort, AVL sort
 

1855
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,109
uh like for example merge sort, AVL sort
these are really the same in terms of

1856
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:47,119
these are really the same in terms of
 

1857
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,510
these are really the same in terms of
asmtoic complexity and kind of the way

1858
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,520
asmtoic complexity and kind of the way
 

1859
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,270
asmtoic complexity and kind of the way
in which you interact with these sorting

1860
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
in which you interact with these sorting
 

1861
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,150
in which you interact with these sorting
algorithms. Um but there are special

1862
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,160
algorithms. Um but there are special
 

1863
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,349
algorithms. Um but there are special
cases where you might use insertion sort

1864
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
cases where you might use insertion sort
 

1865
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,349
cases where you might use insertion sort
or selection sort. Actually I'm not sure

1866
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359
or selection sort. Actually I'm not sure
 

1867
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,790
or selection sort. Actually I'm not sure
about insertion sort. I there you had a

1868
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:02,800
about insertion sort. I there you had a
 

1869
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,990
about insertion sort. I there you had a
uh in your recitation

1870
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
uh in your recitation
 

1871
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,750
uh in your recitation
two days ago uh I think you guys showed

1872
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
two days ago uh I think you guys showed
 

1873
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,790
two days ago uh I think you guys showed
how to do uh if you had a kroximate

1874
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:12,800
how to do uh if you had a kroximate
 

1875
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,349
how to do uh if you had a kroximate
array where things are not more than k

1876
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:15,359
array where things are not more than k
 

1877
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,349
array where things are not more than k
away from each other. Insertion sort

1878
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:17,359
away from each other. Insertion sort
 

1879
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,270
away from each other. Insertion sort
actually runs in n times k and so if k

1880
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,280
actually runs in n times k and so if k
 

1881
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,190
actually runs in n times k and so if k
is small then that's really good. That's

1882
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,200
is small then that's really good. That's
 

1883
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,870
is small then that's really good. That's
kind of like linear. But you can

1884
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:22,880
kind of like linear. But you can
 

1885
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,910
kind of like linear. But you can
actually do even better with a binary

1886
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:25,920
actually do even better with a binary
 

1887
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,589
actually do even better with a binary
heap which you saw in recitation

1888
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:27,599
heap which you saw in recitation
 

1889
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,430
heap which you saw in recitation
hopefully where you can get that down to

1890
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
hopefully where you can get that down to
 

1891
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,030
hopefully where you can get that down to
n log k by keeping maintaining a heap as

1892
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,040
n log k by keeping maintaining a heap as
 

1893
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,510
n log k by keeping maintaining a heap as
you go across and finding the max that

1894
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
you go across and finding the max that
 

1895
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,589
you go across and finding the max that
way. Okay. Uh so insertion sort maybe is

1896
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:39,599
way. Okay. Uh so insertion sort maybe is
 

1897
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,550
way. Okay. Uh so insertion sort maybe is
not so great but uh selection sort right

1898
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,560
not so great but uh selection sort right
 

1899
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,430
not so great but uh selection sort right
the the name of the game there is that

1900
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,440
the the name of the game there is that
 

1901
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,950
the the name of the game there is that
uh if my reads are cheap but my rights

1902
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:50,960
uh if my reads are cheap but my rights
 

1903
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,150
uh if my reads are cheap but my rights
are expensive right uh selection sword

1904
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,160
are expensive right uh selection sword
 

1905
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,670
are expensive right uh selection sword
actually does pretty well because I only

1906
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
actually does pretty well because I only
 

1907
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,990
actually does pretty well because I only
have to do uh sorry my reads are cheap

1908
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
have to do uh sorry my reads are cheap
 

1909
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,390
have to do uh sorry my reads are cheap
and my rights are yeah expensive right

1910
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,400
and my rights are yeah expensive right
 

1911
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,910
and my rights are yeah expensive right
selection sort only does a linear number

1912
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:01,920
selection sort only does a linear number
 

1913
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,589
selection sort only does a linear number
of swaps right it's looking down finding

1914
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
of swaps right it's looking down finding
 

1915
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,589
of swaps right it's looking down finding
the max swapping it in and keep going

1916
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:05,599
the max swapping it in and keep going
 

1917
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,470
the max swapping it in and keep going
right and so such cases that's actually

1918
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:08,480
right and so such cases that's actually
 

1919
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,310
right and so such cases that's actually
better than any of these other

1920
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,320
better than any of these other
 

1921
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,030
better than any of these other
algorithms that we've got. Yeah. Is he

1922
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,040
algorithms that we've got. Yeah. Is he
 

1923
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,190
algorithms that we've got. Yeah. Is he
sort time um worst case or expected?

1924
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,200
sort time um worst case or expected?
 

1925
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,310
sort time um worst case or expected?
This is worst case. Okay. So, it's a

1926
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:20,320
This is worst case. Okay. So, it's a
 

1927
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,829
This is worst case. Okay. So, it's a
little hard to put there was a lot of

1928
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
little hard to put there was a lot of
 

1929
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,550
little hard to put there was a lot of
moving parts to get to this bound uh in

1930
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
moving parts to get to this bound uh in
 

1931
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,430
moving parts to get to this bound uh in
on in Tuesday's lecture, right? Uh

1932
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,440
on in Tuesday's lecture, right? Uh
 

1933
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,190
on in Tuesday's lecture, right? Uh
basically what we did, we showed you how

1934
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,200
basically what we did, we showed you how
 

1935
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,310
basically what we did, we showed you how
to think of an array as a heap, as a

1936
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,320
to think of an array as a heap, as a
 

1937
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,950
to think of an array as a heap, as a
binary tree, right? Complete binary

1938
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960
binary tree, right? Complete binary
 

1939
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,349
binary tree, right? Complete binary
tree. It's not an AVL. I mean, it is an

1940
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:37,359
tree. It's not an AVL. I mean, it is an
 

1941
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,349
tree. It's not an AVL. I mean, it is an
AVL tree, but like AVL trees are weaker

1942
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359
AVL tree, but like AVL trees are weaker
 

1943
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,510
AVL tree, but like AVL trees are weaker
than a complete tree, right? Height

1944
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
than a complete tree, right? Height
 

1945
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,270
than a complete tree, right? Height
balance is a weaker property than a

1946
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,280
balance is a weaker property than a
 

1947
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,910
balance is a weaker property than a
complete, right? The the the reason why

1948
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
complete, right? The the the reason why
 

1949
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,510
complete, right? The the the reason why
we use complete is because it's unique

1950
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,520
we use complete is because it's unique
 

1951
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,430
we use complete is because it's unique
for a number of nodes, right? That way I

1952
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
for a number of nodes, right? That way I
 

1953
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,430
for a number of nodes, right? That way I
when I give you one array with a fixed

1954
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
when I give you one array with a fixed
 

1955
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,510
when I give you one array with a fixed
length, I know exactly what tree you're

1956
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
length, I know exactly what tree you're
 

1957
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,270
length, I know exactly what tree you're
talking about because there's a onetoone

1958
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
talking about because there's a onetoone
 

1959
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,750
talking about because there's a onetoone
mapping there, right? If I I can't if I

1960
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
mapping there, right? If I I can't if I
 

1961
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,030
mapping there, right? If I I can't if I
there was it some ambigu ambiguity on

1962
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
there was it some ambigu ambiguity on
 

1963
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,510
there was it some ambigu ambiguity on
what tree I was talking about I wouldn't

1964
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
what tree I was talking about I wouldn't
 

1965
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,150
what tree I was talking about I wouldn't
heaps just wouldn't work right so what

1966
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,160
heaps just wouldn't work right so what
 

1967
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,630
heaps just wouldn't work right so what
what heaps sort does is it has this

1968
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
what heaps sort does is it has this
 

1969
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,630
what heaps sort does is it has this
correspondence between arrays and binary

1970
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:18,640
correspondence between arrays and binary
 

1971
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,069
correspondence between arrays and binary
trees uh and then what it does is uh

1972
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:22,079
trees uh and then what it does is uh
 

1973
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,150
trees uh and then what it does is uh
provides these operations that kind of

1974
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
provides these operations that kind of
 

1975
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,190
provides these operations that kind of
only do operations at the end right and

1976
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,200
only do operations at the end right and
 

1977
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,470
only do operations at the end right and
then the in place uh uh optimization is

1978
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:30,480
then the in place uh uh optimization is
 

1979
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,310
then the in place uh uh optimization is
that well instead of actually popping it

1980
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:32,320
that well instead of actually popping it
 

1981
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,710
that well instead of actually popping it
or pushing it onto the back of an array.

1982
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
or pushing it onto the back of an array.
 

1983
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,870
or pushing it onto the back of an array.
I'm just going to think of a subset of

1984
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
I'm just going to think of a subset of
 

1985
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,589
I'm just going to think of a subset of
my array as a heap and then always

1986
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
my array as a heap and then always
 

1987
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,230
my array as a heap and then always
kind of pooping the max out to the the

1988
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
kind of pooping the max out to the the
 

1989
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,069
kind of pooping the max out to the the
end, right? Just leaving it behind and

1990
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:48,079
end, right? Just leaving it behind and
 

1991
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,950
end, right? Just leaving it behind and
thinking of my heap as a smaller subset,

1992
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
thinking of my heap as a smaller subset,
 

1993
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,630
thinking of my heap as a smaller subset,
right? And that's how we got it. It

1994
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:54,640
right? And that's how we got it. It
 

1995
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,510
right? And that's how we got it. It
didn't actually use any amortization

1996
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
didn't actually use any amortization
 

1997
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,109
didn't actually use any amortization
uh for for the timebound timebound. You

1998
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
uh for for the timebound timebound. You
 

1999
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,309
uh for for the timebound timebound. You
could actually do this with the

2000
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
could actually do this with the
 

2001
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,030
could actually do this with the
amortized basically dynamic array

2002
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
amortized basically dynamic array
 

2003
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,790
amortized basically dynamic array
version of this. The timebound doesn't

2004
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:06,800
version of this. The timebound doesn't
 

2005
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,710
version of this. The timebound doesn't
rely on that. The in place relies on you

2006
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:10,720
rely on that. The in place relies on you
 

2007
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,710
rely on that. The in place relies on you
know key staying all within one array.

2008
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:12,720
know key staying all within one array.
 

2009
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,270
know key staying all within one array.
Does that make sense that you're doing a

2010
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,280
Does that make sense that you're doing a
 

2011
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,510
Does that make sense that you're doing a
bunch of amortized operations so that

2012
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
bunch of amortized operations so that
 

2013
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,030
bunch of amortized operations so that
this actually does achieve worst case

2014
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,040
this actually does achieve worst case
 

2015
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,990
this actually does achieve worst case
and login? Yeah. It seems that like the

2016
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
and login? Yeah. It seems that like the
 

2017
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,630
and login? Yeah. It seems that like the
things we learn not like such a long

2018
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
things we learn not like such a long
 

2019
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,950
things we learn not like such a long
time ago are they tend to be better. So

2020
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:26,960
time ago are they tend to be better. So
 

2021
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,710
time ago are they tend to be better. So
assume that most algorithms you want

2022
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:28,720
assume that most algorithms you want
 

2023
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,270
assume that most algorithms you want
them to be you know

2024
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,280
them to be you know
 

2025
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,069
them to be you know
faster. Um it seems like we will not use

2026
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
faster. Um it seems like we will not use
 

2027
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,309
faster. Um it seems like we will not use
as often especially in the exam as well

2028
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:36,319
as often especially in the exam as well
 

2029
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,470
as often especially in the exam as well
insertion and selection right yeah so

2030
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:38,480
insertion and selection right yeah so
 

2031
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,829
insertion and selection right yeah so
there are these special cases where

2032
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:39,839
there are these special cases where
 

2033
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,910
there are these special cases where
they're good right but I mean uh you

2034
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:43,920
they're good right but I mean uh you
 

2035
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,390
they're good right but I mean uh you
know generally these are better general

2036
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,400
know generally these are better general
 

2037
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,710
know generally these are better general
data structures for most situations that

2038
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:48,720
data structures for most situations that
 

2039
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,790
data structures for most situations that
you come across. I mean there are cases

2040
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:50,800
you come across. I mean there are cases
 

2041
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,470
you come across. I mean there are cases
where those other things are good so you

2042
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,480
where those other things are good so you
 

2043
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,990
where those other things are good so you
don't want to completely ignore them

2044
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
don't want to completely ignore them
 

2045
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,510
don't want to completely ignore them
right but generally uh yeah you trying

2046
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
right but generally uh yeah you trying
 

2047
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,109
right but generally uh yeah you trying
to be lower down in this chart. What I

2048
00:41:59,109 --> 00:41:59,119
to be lower down in this chart. What I
 

2049
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,950
to be lower down in this chart. What I
mean is that if I don't have any exam

2050
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
mean is that if I don't have any exam
 

2051
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,870
mean is that if I don't have any exam
like I'm using them all except for like

2052
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:02,880
like I'm using them all except for like
 

2053
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,349
like I'm using them all except for like
selection it won't there's too many

2054
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,359
selection it won't there's too many
 

2055
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,950
selection it won't there's too many
things on here for us to test all of

2056
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
things on here for us to test all of
 

2057
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,150
things on here for us to test all of
them on an exam. Okay. So don't be

2058
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,160
them on an exam. Okay. So don't be
 

2059
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,390
them on an exam. Okay. So don't be
afraid if not everything is covered.

2060
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,400
afraid if not everything is covered.
 

2061
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,710
afraid if not everything is covered.
Worry when things are covered 18 times

2062
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:14,720
Worry when things are covered 18 times
 

2063
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,270
Worry when things are covered 18 times
on the exam. That's not good right. Um

2064
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:17,280
on the exam. That's not good right. Um
 

2065
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,309
on the exam. That's not good right. Um
okay. So for radic sort there are

2066
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:20,319
okay. So for radic sort there are
 

2067
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,870
okay. So for radic sort there are
situations where right you get linear

2068
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:22,880
situations where right you get linear
 

2069
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,550
situations where right you get linear
time right it's when you're polinomially

2070
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,560
time right it's when you're polinomially
 

2071
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,430
time right it's when you're polinomially
bounded is there are there times when I

2072
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,440
bounded is there are there times when I
 

2073
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,550
bounded is there are there times when I
want to use radic sort when I'm not

2074
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:30,560
want to use radic sort when I'm not
 

2075
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,910
want to use radic sort when I'm not
polomially bounded in my integers

2076
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:37,920

 

2077
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,750

well if you're not polinomially bounded

2078
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:39,760
well if you're not polinomially bounded
 

2079
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,750
well if you're not polinomially bounded
then that could take a really long time.

2080
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:41,760
then that could take a really long time.
 

2081
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,150
then that could take a really long time.
Sure. Yeah. But like where's the

2082
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,160
Sure. Yeah. But like where's the
 

2083
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,550
Sure. Yeah. But like where's the
uh this will be worse than n login when

2084
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:52,560
uh this will be worse than n login when
 

2085
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,390
uh this will be worse than n login when
right it's definitely better than n

2086
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:54,400
right it's definitely better than n
 

2087
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,309
right it's definitely better than n
login when u is polomially bounded right

2088
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:58,319
login when u is polomially bounded right
 

2089
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,550
login when u is polomially bounded right
because it's linear

2090
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
because it's linear
 

2091
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,069
because it's linear
yeah

2092
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079
yeah
 

2093
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,910
yeah
n

2094
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:03,920
n
 

2095
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,309
n
to the n okay so if I put n to the n in

2096
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319
to the n okay so if I put n to the n in
 

2097
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,750
to the n okay so if I put n to the n in
here right I get an n factor that comes

2098
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
here right I get an n factor that comes
 

2099
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,150
here right I get an n factor that comes
out here that gives me quadratic running

2100
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
out here that gives me quadratic running
 

2101
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,150
out here that gives me quadratic running
time which is not great. Okay. But when

2102
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,160
time which is not great. Okay. But when
 

2103
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,710
time which is not great. Okay. But when
will this be better than n login?

2104
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:22,720
will this be better than n login?
 

2105
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,150
will this be better than n login?
Yeah. Uh n to the c is less than n to

2106
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,160
Yeah. Uh n to the c is less than n to
 

2107
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,349
Yeah. Uh n to the c is less than n to
the c. Uh n to the c. So that'll

2108
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
the c. Uh n to the c. So that'll
 

2109
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,030
the c. Uh n to the c. So that'll
definitely give us linear time, right?

2110
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,040
definitely give us linear time, right?
 

2111
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,550
definitely give us linear time, right?
That's what this is saying. But we can

2112
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560
That's what this is saying. But we can
 

2113
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,030
That's what this is saying. But we can
actually do better than n login if this

2114
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
actually do better than n login if this
 

2115
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,150
actually do better than n login if this
u is n to the c * log n, right? for some

2116
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
u is n to the c * log n, right? for some
 

2117
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,870
u is n to the c * log n, right? for some
C, right? If it's if it's as like if

2118
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:44,880
C, right? If it's if it's as like if
 

2119
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,630
C, right? If it's if it's as like if
it's N to the C log login log N, right?

2120
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:48,640
it's N to the C log login log N, right?
 

2121
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,230
it's N to the C log login log N, right?
That's smaller than login, right? So

2122
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
That's smaller than login, right? So
 

2123
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,550
That's smaller than login, right? So
that's a better algorithm, right? That's

2124
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
that's a better algorithm, right? That's
 

2125
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,069
that's a better algorithm, right? That's
a faster alg. Do you guys see why we

2126
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:56,079
a faster alg. Do you guys see why we
 

2127
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,270
a faster alg. Do you guys see why we
wrote these things this way is so that

2128
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
wrote these things this way is so that
 

2129
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,750
wrote these things this way is so that
we give you a more precise bound. It's

2130
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:01,760
we give you a more precise bound. It's
 

2131
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,670
we give you a more precise bound. It's
it's this is more important for you

2132
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
it's this is more important for you
 

2133
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,069
it's this is more important for you
understand what U means here than that

2134
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:06,079
understand what U means here than that
 

2135
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,069
understand what U means here than that
that this thing sometimes runs in linear

2136
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
that this thing sometimes runs in linear
 

2137
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,109
that this thing sometimes runs in linear
time, right? We want to know you when it

2138
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
time, right? We want to know you when it
 

2139
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,270
time, right? We want to know you when it
runs in linear time, right? Does that

2140
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
runs in linear time, right? Does that
 

2141
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,829
runs in linear time, right? Does that
make sense? Or when it runs faster than

2142
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
make sense? Or when it runs faster than
 

2143
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,990
make sense? Or when it runs faster than
merge sort. Does that make sense?

2144
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
merge sort. Does that make sense?
 

2145
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,109
merge sort. Does that make sense?
Okay. So that's sorting.

2146
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
Okay. So that's sorting.
 

2147
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,670
Okay. So that's sorting.
Uh we have sequence type data

2148
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
Uh we have sequence type data
 

2149
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,750
Uh we have sequence type data
structures, right? We have linked lists,

2150
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:27,760
structures, right? We have linked lists,
 

2151
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,430
structures, right? We have linked lists,
we have dynamic arrays, we have sequence

2152
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:29,440
we have dynamic arrays, we have sequence
 

2153
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,710
we have dynamic arrays, we have sequence
AVLs. Sequence AVLs are great. I don't

2154
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,720
AVLs. Sequence AVLs are great. I don't
 

2155
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,470
AVLs. Sequence AVLs are great. I don't
know why no one teaches it. They're

2156
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,480
know why no one teaches it. They're
 

2157
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,710
know why no one teaches it. They're
great. They don't teach it probably

2158
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
great. They don't teach it probably
 

2159
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,790
great. They don't teach it probably
because they're actually not that

2160
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
because they're actually not that
 

2161
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,990
because they're actually not that
useful, right? They you don't actually

2162
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000
useful, right? They you don't actually
 

2163
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,510
useful, right? They you don't actually
use the insert in the middle a lot,

2164
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
use the insert in the middle a lot,
 

2165
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,910
use the insert in the middle a lot,
right, in coding, right? So it's it you

2166
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
right, in coding, right? So it's it you
 

2167
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,670
right, in coding, right? So it's it you
can usually get around with like

2168
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:49,680
can usually get around with like
 

2169
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,510
can usually get around with like
shifting something to the end and doing

2170
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,520
shifting something to the end and doing
 

2171
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,270
shifting something to the end and doing
dynamic operations there, right? And

2172
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:53,280
dynamic operations there, right? And
 

2173
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,790
dynamic operations there, right? And
that's a lot of the games that you try

2174
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:54,800
that's a lot of the games that you try
 

2175
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,390
that's a lot of the games that you try
to play. So you don't have to make your

2176
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
to play. So you don't have to make your
 

2177
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,390
to play. So you don't have to make your
own data structures and you can just use

2178
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
own data structures and you can just use
 

2179
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,550
own data structures and you can just use
the Python list that's in your in like

2180
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
the Python list that's in your in like
 

2181
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,870
the Python list that's in your in like
native to your thing, right? But theor

2182
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
native to your thing, right? But theor
 

2183
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,710
native to your thing, right? But theor
it has a theoretical interest because it

2184
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:06,720
it has a theoretical interest because it
 

2185
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,109
it has a theoretical interest because it
gets these kind of balance bounds if you

2186
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:09,119
gets these kind of balance bounds if you
 

2187
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,630
gets these kind of balance bounds if you
need to insert in the middle of this

2188
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
need to insert in the middle of this
 

2189
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,950
need to insert in the middle of this
sequence. Right? Uh now some of you look

2190
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:14,960
sequence. Right? Uh now some of you look
 

2191
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,150
sequence. Right? Uh now some of you look
at me and had a question before right

2192
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,160
at me and had a question before right
 

2193
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,270
at me and had a question before right
that was like but Jason how does linked

2194
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,280
that was like but Jason how does linked
 

2195
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,430
that was like but Jason how does linked
list operations on the end of a linked

2196
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:27,440
list operations on the end of a linked
 

2197
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,309
list operations on the end of a linked
list why does that take linear time?

2198
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
list why does that take linear time?
 

2199
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,670
list why does that take linear time?
It's because in lecture we presented you

2200
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
It's because in lecture we presented you
 

2201
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,030
It's because in lecture we presented you
with what?

2202
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,040

 

2203
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,230

A singly linked list, right? It just had

2204
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:40,240
A singly linked list, right? It just had
 

2205
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,630
A singly linked list, right? It just had
pointers to the next thing, right? And

2206
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:42,640
pointers to the next thing, right? And
 

2207
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,990
pointers to the next thing, right? And
if I only have pointers to the next

2208
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,000
if I only have pointers to the next
 

2209
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,470
if I only have pointers to the next
thing and a pointer to the head, for me

2210
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480
thing and a pointer to the head, for me
 

2211
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,990
thing and a pointer to the head, for me
to find the end, right? I need to walk

2212
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,000
to find the end, right? I need to walk
 

2213
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,790
to find the end, right? I need to walk
all the way down the list, right? Now,

2214
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
all the way down the list, right? Now,
 

2215
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,470
all the way down the list, right? Now,
let's say I keep my pointer to the tail.

2216
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,480
let's say I keep my pointer to the tail.
 

2217
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,349
let's say I keep my pointer to the tail.
then finding that end one is fine but

2218
00:45:59,349 --> 00:45:59,359
then finding that end one is fine but
 

2219
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,349
then finding that end one is fine but
removing it still takes linear time

2220
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,359
removing it still takes linear time
 

2221
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,069
removing it still takes linear time
because I don't know what came before me

2222
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:04,079
because I don't know what came before me
 

2223
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,790
because I don't know what came before me
right and so that's why in pet set

2224
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:06,800
right and so that's why in pet set
 

2225
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,390
right and so that's why in pet set
whatever one two I don't remember uh you

2226
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,400
whatever one two I don't remember uh you
 

2227
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,470
whatever one two I don't remember uh you
stored a pointer back to your previous

2228
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,480
stored a pointer back to your previous
 

2229
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,230
stored a pointer back to your previous
one that gave you doubly linked lists

2230
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,240
one that gave you doubly linked lists
 

2231
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,430
one that gave you doubly linked lists
yay right so actually expanding this

2232
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:17,440
yay right so actually expanding this
 

2233
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,270
yay right so actually expanding this
table out

2234
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:19,280
table out
 

2235
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,670
table out
you can reference a doubly linked list

2236
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:21,680
you can reference a doubly linked list
 

2237
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,870
you can reference a doubly linked list
here and get this one as constant time

2238
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:24,880
here and get this one as constant time
 

2239
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,630
here and get this one as constant time
does that make sense

2240
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640
does that make sense
 

2241
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,069
does that make sense
And uh this one still linear time,

2242
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:30,079
And uh this one still linear time,
 

2243
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,870
And uh this one still linear time,
right? Okay. Uh but this one's still

2244
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
right? Okay. Uh but this one's still
 

2245
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,190
right? Okay. Uh but this one's still
linear time. Uh we al actually also

2246
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,200
linear time. Uh we al actually also
 

2247
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,589
linear time. Uh we al actually also
showed you how to do this in constant

2248
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:37,599
showed you how to do this in constant
 

2249
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,069
showed you how to do this in constant
amortize. Do do you guys remember that?

2250
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
amortize. Do do you guys remember that?
 

2251
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,589
amortize. Do do you guys remember that?
That was in problem session

2252
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
That was in problem session
 

2253
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,710
That was in problem session
two or one. I don't remember remember it

2254
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,720
two or one. I don't remember remember it
 

2255
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,710
two or one. I don't remember remember it
was whatever we talking about uh

2256
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
was whatever we talking about uh
 

2257
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,270
was whatever we talking about uh
amortized stuff, right? We got we got

2258
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:51,280
amortized stuff, right? We got we got
 

2259
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,390
amortized stuff, right? We got we got
actually both of these to one amortized

2260
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
actually both of these to one amortized
 

2261
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,589
actually both of these to one amortized
using the concepts of a dynamic array.

2262
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599
using the concepts of a dynamic array.
 

2263
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,589
using the concepts of a dynamic array.
Right? And then we actually did it one

2264
00:46:59,589 --> 00:46:59,599
Right? And then we actually did it one
 

2265
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,270
Right? And then we actually did it one
more time where we got a good

2266
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
more time where we got a good
 

2267
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,190
more time where we got a good
double-ended thing. What was that?

2268
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,200
double-ended thing. What was that?
 

2269
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,589
double-ended thing. What was that?
Does anyone remember? We went to problem

2270
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:07,599
Does anyone remember? We went to problem
 

2271
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,630
Does anyone remember? We went to problem
session three. Yeah. Oh, I'm probably

2272
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:10,640
session three. Yeah. Oh, I'm probably
 

2273
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,630
session three. Yeah. Oh, I'm probably
wrong. This is

2274
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:12,640
wrong. This is
 

2275
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,550
wrong. This is
like Q.

2276
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:14,560
like Q.
 

2277
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,589
like Q.
So QDQ uh those are talking about

2278
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:17,599
So QDQ uh those are talking about
 

2279
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,790
So QDQ uh those are talking about
double-ended things. uh those are

2280
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:20,800
double-ended things. uh those are
 

2281
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,270
double-ended things. uh those are
implemented in a certain way right which

2282
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:23,280
implemented in a certain way right which
 

2283
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,030
implemented in a certain way right which
is actually one of these things it's

2284
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,040
is actually one of these things it's
 

2285
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,950
is actually one of these things it's
actually I think this one in Python uh

2286
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:28,960
actually I think this one in Python uh
 

2287
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,750
actually I think this one in Python uh
but uh there's we used a different data

2288
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:31,760
but uh there's we used a different data
 

2289
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,829
but uh there's we used a different data
structure to get something that had

2290
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:33,839
structure to get something that had
 

2291
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,190
structure to get something that had
really good at right it had really good

2292
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:37,200
really good at right it had really good
 

2293
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,790
really good at right it had really good
pop and append and first and last

2294
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
pop and append and first and last
 

2295
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,109
pop and append and first and last
dynamic operations do you guys anyone

2296
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:43,119
dynamic operations do you guys anyone
 

2297
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:50,630
dynamic operations do you guys anyone
remember problem session three

2298
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640

 

2299
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,670

space. That's That's what this was,

2300
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,680
space. That's That's what this was,
 

2301
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,470
space. That's That's what this was,
right? Okay. We got one that had

2302
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:56,480
right? Okay. We got one that had
 

2303
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,710
right? Okay. We got one that had
expected bounds. Does that help?

2304
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:00,720
expected bounds. Does that help?
 

2305
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,150
expected bounds. Does that help?
Really? I heard someone say it.

2306
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
Really? I heard someone say it.
 

2307
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,390
Really? I heard someone say it.
Hash table. Yeah. So, what basically you

2308
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
Hash table. Yeah. So, what basically you
 

2309
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,349
Hash table. Yeah. So, what basically you
did you instead of you you this is a

2310
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
did you instead of you you this is a
 

2311
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,030
did you instead of you you this is a
sequence thing. These things don't have

2312
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
sequence thing. These things don't have
 

2313
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,950
sequence thing. These things don't have
keys, right? But I could identify with

2314
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:14,960
keys, right? But I could identify with
 

2315
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,630
keys, right? But I could identify with
each item as I stick it in a key

2316
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:18,640
each item as I stick it in a key
 

2317
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,030
each item as I stick it in a key
representing its index, right? And I

2318
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
representing its index, right? And I
 

2319
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,470
representing its index, right? And I
could use a hash table that way. Now

2320
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:22,480
could use a hash table that way. Now
 

2321
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,589
could use a hash table that way. Now
there was some difficulty, right? If I

2322
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:25,599
there was some difficulty, right? If I
 

2323
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,589
there was some difficulty, right? If I
removed the first thing, right? Or

2324
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:29,599
removed the first thing, right? Or
 

2325
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,510
removed the first thing, right? Or
right, because actually how how those

2326
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,520
right, because actually how how those
 

2327
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,349
right, because actually how how those
all of my indices have now changed,

2328
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
all of my indices have now changed,
 

2329
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,190
all of my indices have now changed,
right? But if I just store what the

2330
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
right? But if I just store what the
 

2331
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,710
right? But if I just store what the
smallest index in my thing is, then then

2332
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:40,720
smallest index in my thing is, then then
 

2333
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,390
smallest index in my thing is, then then
I'm golden because I can compute what

2334
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:42,400
I'm golden because I can compute what
 

2335
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,950
I'm golden because I can compute what
that index should be, right? As I as I

2336
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:44,960
that index should be, right? As I as I
 

2337
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,630
that index should be, right? As I as I
change things at the front. Okay. So

2338
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:46,640
change things at the front. Okay. So
 

2339
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,950
change things at the front. Okay. So
there's actually three different ways we

2340
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:48,960
there's actually three different ways we
 

2341
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,790
there's actually three different ways we
showed you of getting constant time at

2342
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:50,800
showed you of getting constant time at
 

2343
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,829
showed you of getting constant time at
the front and the back of this thing. So

2344
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:53,839
the front and the back of this thing. So
 

2345
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,309
the front and the back of this thing. So
actually you can think of that as

2346
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
actually you can think of that as
 

2347
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,150
actually you can think of that as
standard material that you can reduce

2348
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,160
standard material that you can reduce
 

2349
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,230
standard material that you can reduce
to. Okay, that's the like one exception

2350
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:00,240
to. Okay, that's the like one exception
 

2351
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,670
to. Okay, that's the like one exception
of the things that I'm not showing on

2352
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
of the things that I'm not showing on
 

2353
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,230
of the things that I'm not showing on
this chart, but is a bonus if you're

2354
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,240
this chart, but is a bonus if you're
 

2355
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,750
this chart, but is a bonus if you're
watching this problem session. Yeah. So

2356
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760
watching this problem session. Yeah. So
 

2357
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,309
watching this problem session. Yeah. So
the so isn't a hash table a set data

2358
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:08,319
the so isn't a hash table a set data
 

2359
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,549
the so isn't a hash table a set data
structure though it is right but it's we

2360
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:10,559
structure though it is right but it's we
 

2361
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,309
structure though it is right but it's we
used it to implement a sequence data

2362
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:12,319
used it to implement a sequence data
 

2363
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,870
used it to implement a sequence data
structure. So I will refer you to that

2364
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:14,880
structure. So I will refer you to that
 

2365
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,390
structure. So I will refer you to that
uh problem session if you want to learn

2366
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:16,400
uh problem session if you want to learn
 

2367
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,069
uh problem session if you want to learn
more about it. Okay. So any questions on

2368
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:20,079
more about it. Okay. So any questions on
 

2369
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,390
more about it. Okay. So any questions on
sequence data structures? Yeah. Uh a

2370
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:22,400
sequence data structures? Yeah. Uh a
 

2371
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,190
sequence data structures? Yeah. Uh a
different question. Uh should we be or

2372
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
different question. Uh should we be or
 

2373
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,670
different question. Uh should we be or
yeah should we be able to like prove the

2374
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,680
yeah should we be able to like prove the
 

2375
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,270
yeah should we be able to like prove the
tables that we're given? So, uh, I would

2376
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:31,280
tables that we're given? So, uh, I would
 

2377
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,430
tables that we're given? So, uh, I would
hope I hope that if I gave you a blank

2378
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,440
hope I hope that if I gave you a blank
 

2379
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,349
hope I hope that if I gave you a blank
table that you would be able to fill it

2380
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:37,359
table that you would be able to fill it
 

2381
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,190
table that you would be able to fill it
out, right? That's how well I want you

2382
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,200
out, right? That's how well I want you
 

2383
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,030
out, right? That's how well I want you
to know how these things are

2384
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
to know how these things are
 

2385
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,190
to know how these things are
implemented.

2386
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:43,200
implemented.
 

2387
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,030
implemented.
I'm we're not going to have that on the

2388
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
I'm we're not going to have that on the
 

2389
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,109
I'm we're not going to have that on the
exam, right? That's a boring kind of

2390
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
exam, right? That's a boring kind of
 

2391
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,589
exam, right? That's a boring kind of
question, but it is important to know.

2392
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:49,599
question, but it is important to know.
 

2393
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,549
question, but it is important to know.
Yeah, I I would um you know, it's good

2394
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
Yeah, I I would um you know, it's good
 

2395
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,470
Yeah, I I would um you know, it's good
for you to think like, oh, if I'm going

2396
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
for you to think like, oh, if I'm going
 

2397
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,630
for you to think like, oh, if I'm going
to use an AVL tree, right, operations

2398
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
to use an AVL tree, right, operations
 

2399
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,390
to use an AVL tree, right, operations
are generally going to be login, right?

2400
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,400
are generally going to be login, right?
 

2401
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,150
are generally going to be login, right?
That's a really useful thing to or if

2402
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:00,160
That's a really useful thing to or if
 

2403
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,990
That's a really useful thing to or if
I'm going to use a hash table, right?

2404
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,000
I'm going to use a hash table, right?
 

2405
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,910
I'm going to use a hash table, right?
Dictionary type operations, you know,

2406
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
Dictionary type operations, you know,
 

2407
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,750
Dictionary type operations, you know,
finding, inserting, and deleting, those

2408
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:05,760
finding, inserting, and deleting, those
 

2409
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,870
finding, inserting, and deleting, those
are fast, doing order type operations on

2410
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
are fast, doing order type operations on
 

2411
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,990
are fast, doing order type operations on
hash structure hashts is bad. That's

2412
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
hash structure hashts is bad. That's
 

2413
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,910
hash structure hashts is bad. That's
hard to do because I have to basically

2414
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
hard to do because I have to basically
 

2415
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,150
hard to do because I have to basically
look through all my things, right? Um,

2416
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,160
look through all my things, right? Um,
 

2417
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,829
look through all my things, right? Um,
knowing that dynamic operations on a

2418
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:17,839
knowing that dynamic operations on a
 

2419
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,870
knowing that dynamic operations on a
sorted array is bad, right? or knowing

2420
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:20,880
sorted array is bad, right? or knowing
 

2421
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,470
sorted array is bad, right? or knowing
that uh you know

2422
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:24,480
that uh you know
 

2423
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,470
that uh you know
you you have to think about here what we

2424
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:26,480
you you have to think about here what we
 

2425
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,309
you you have to think about here what we
mean when we say linked list and dynamic

2426
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
mean when we say linked list and dynamic
 

2427
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,030
mean when we say linked list and dynamic
array in this table right because sing

2428
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,040
array in this table right because sing
 

2429
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,030
array in this table right because sing
you've yeah exactly we are implying

2430
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,040
you've yeah exactly we are implying
 

2431
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,630
you've yeah exactly we are implying
singly linked here because that's what

2432
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:34,640
singly linked here because that's what
 

2433
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,710
singly linked here because that's what
we presented to you in lecture and so

2434
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:36,720
we presented to you in lecture and so
 

2435
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,230
we presented to you in lecture and so
those are the standard things that we

2436
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240
those are the standard things that we
 

2437
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,829
those are the standard things that we
want you to reduce to so the three

2438
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:39,839
want you to reduce to so the three
 

2439
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,910
want you to reduce to so the three
modified standard things are the double

2440
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:41,920
modified standard things are the double
 

2441
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,230
modified standard things are the double
list the double ended yeah basically you

2442
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
list the double ended yeah basically you
 

2443
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,630
list the double ended yeah basically you
can assume that you have a doubly it's

2444
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:46,640
can assume that you have a doubly it's
 

2445
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,270
can assume that you have a doubly it's
this one that you probably want to use

2446
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:49,280
this one that you probably want to use
 

2447
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,589
this one that you probably want to use
Right? Because you get

2448
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
Right? Because you get
 

2449
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,549
Right? Because you get
constant indexing, right? And then

2450
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:54,559
constant indexing, right? And then
 

2451
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,549
constant indexing, right? And then
pretty good on both ends, right? But you

2452
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:58,559
pretty good on both ends, right? But you
 

2453
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,549
pretty good on both ends, right? But you
know, if you need a double-ended queue,

2454
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
know, if you need a double-ended queue,
 

2455
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,710
know, if you need a double-ended queue,
you can also reduce it to having two

2456
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,720
you can also reduce it to having two
 

2457
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,109
you can also reduce it to having two
dynamic arrays back to back. One going

2458
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:05,119
dynamic arrays back to back. One going
 

2459
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,710
dynamic arrays back to back. One going
this way, one going this way. And so

2460
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
this way, one going this way. And so
 

2461
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,309
this way, one going this way. And so
there's lots of way. We're not going to

2462
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
there's lots of way. We're not going to
 

2463
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,990
there's lots of way. We're not going to
give that to you as a standard method

2464
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,000
give that to you as a standard method
 

2465
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,670
give that to you as a standard method
because there's literally like four

2466
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:11,680
because there's literally like four
 

2467
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,750
because there's literally like four
methods we showed you how to do, right?

2468
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:13,760
methods we showed you how to do, right?
 

2469
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,390
methods we showed you how to do, right?
So you choose one. Okay. Yeah. In the

2470
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:16,400
So you choose one. Okay. Yeah. In the
 

2471
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,630
So you choose one. Okay. Yeah. In the
interest of like saving time on the exam

2472
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
interest of like saving time on the exam
 

2473
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,870
interest of like saving time on the exam
like if we want to say like we do this

2474
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:20,880
like if we want to say like we do this
 

2475
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,190
like if we want to say like we do this
thing with the sequence and it takes

2476
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
thing with the sequence and it takes
 

2477
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,870
thing with the sequence and it takes
login time like do we have to like say

2478
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:24,880
login time like do we have to like say
 

2479
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,990
login time like do we have to like say
the sentence like because it's a

2480
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,000
the sentence like because it's a
 

2481
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,829
the sentence like because it's a
sequence AVL it takes long time because

2482
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:27,839
sequence AVL it takes long time because
 

2483
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,829
sequence AVL it takes long time because
this or can we just like say like per

2484
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
this or can we just like say like per
 

2485
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,270
this or can we just like say like per
the table that we yeah no if if you just

2486
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
the table that we yeah no if if you just
 

2487
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,790
the table that we yeah no if if you just
if you told me that you're storing

2488
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:34,800
if you told me that you're storing
 

2489
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,109
if you told me that you're storing
things in a sequence AVL right and you

2490
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:37,119
things in a sequence AVL right and you
 

2491
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,670
things in a sequence AVL right and you
just say you basically say what you do

2492
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:39,680
just say you basically say what you do
 

2493
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,910
just say you basically say what you do
to it and you say which takes blah blah

2494
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:41,920
to it and you say which takes blah blah
 

2495
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,750
to it and you say which takes blah blah
blah time you don't need to say because

2496
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:43,760
blah time you don't need to say because
 

2497
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,150
blah time you don't need to say because
it's a sequence AVL Right? Because you

2498
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
it's a sequence AVL Right? Because you
 

2499
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,430
it's a sequence AVL Right? Because you
already told us it's a sequence of

2500
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:47,440
already told us it's a sequence of
 

2501
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,750
already told us it's a sequence of
wheel. I believe that you probably wrote

2502
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:49,760
wheel. I believe that you probably wrote
 

2503
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,109
wheel. I believe that you probably wrote
the chart on your cheat sheet and you

2504
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:51,119
the chart on your cheat sheet and you
 

2505
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,870
the chart on your cheat sheet and you
looked it up. Okay. All right. Uh any

2506
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:54,880
looked it up. Okay. All right. Uh any
 

2507
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,349
looked it up. Okay. All right. Uh any
other questions on this? No. Yeah. Just

2508
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:57,359
other questions on this? No. Yeah. Just
 

2509
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,150
other questions on this? No. Yeah. Just
to make sure the double link list will

2510
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:00,160
to make sure the double link list will
 

2511
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,270
to make sure the double link list will
make the insert and be all one. Is that

2512
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,280
make the insert and be all one. Is that
 

2513
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,549
make the insert and be all one. Is that
the only change? Yes. That double link

2514
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:06,559
the only change? Yes. That double link
 

2515
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,630
the only change? Yes. That double link
list gives this guy constant time.

2516
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:10,640
list gives this guy constant time.
 

2517
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,390
list gives this guy constant time.
And actually there are two operations

2518
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,400
And actually there are two operations
 

2519
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,630
And actually there are two operations
here. uh insert delete and I guess

2520
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
here. uh insert delete and I guess
 

2521
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,670
here. uh insert delete and I guess
there's a find here as well right if I

2522
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:17,680
there's a find here as well right if I
 

2523
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,510
there's a find here as well right if I
just store the tail pointer that gets

2524
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,520
just store the tail pointer that gets
 

2525
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,549
just store the tail pointer that gets
the find to constant time right but it

2526
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:22,559
the find to constant time right but it
 

2527
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,390
the find to constant time right but it
doesn't get the dynamic ones to constant

2528
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:24,400
doesn't get the dynamic ones to constant
 

2529
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,230
doesn't get the dynamic ones to constant
time right I need to store the previous

2530
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240
time right I need to store the previous
 

2531
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,069
time right I need to store the previous
pointers as well at each node does that

2532
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
pointers as well at each node does that
 

2533
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,870
pointers as well at each node does that
make sense okay

2534
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:30,880
make sense okay
 

2535
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,630
make sense okay
uh lastly or I guess second to lastly

2536
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
uh lastly or I guess second to lastly
 

2537
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,549
uh lastly or I guess second to lastly
set data structures there are a little

2538
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:36,559
set data structures there are a little
 

2539
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,470
set data structures there are a little
bit more of these not so many more but

2540
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
bit more of these not so many more but
 

2541
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,230
bit more of these not so many more but
uh

2542
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240
uh
 

2543
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,230
uh
But yeah uh we had a sorted array gets

2544
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
But yeah uh we had a sorted array gets
 

2545
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,349
But yeah uh we had a sorted array gets
good find but is not dynamic right

2546
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359

 

2547
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,109

we set AVL tree which does pretty good

2548
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
we set AVL tree which does pretty good
 

2549
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,589
we set AVL tree which does pretty good
find and is dynamic again you get this

2550
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
find and is dynamic again you get this
 

2551
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,750
find and is dynamic again you get this

essentially what you're doing with both

2554
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
essentially what you're doing with both
 

2555
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,630
essentially what you're doing with both
of those data structures is to sort

2556
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
of those data structures is to sort
 

2557
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,750
of those data structures is to sort
right but if I'm looking on a theory

2558
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:09,760
right but if I'm looking on a theory
 

2559
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,270
right but if I'm looking on a theory
question Right? Like I'm not asking you

2560
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
question Right? Like I'm not asking you
 

2561
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,790
question Right? Like I'm not asking you
something specifically about a sorted

2562
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
something specifically about a sorted
 

2563
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,030
something specifically about a sorted
array. Right? If you have a choice

2564
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
array. Right? If you have a choice
 

2565
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,670
array. Right? If you have a choice
between this data structure and this

2566
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
between this data structure and this
 

2567
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,510
between this data structure and this
data structure, which one do you choose?

2568
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:25,520

 

2569
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,750

Well, I don't quite know because it's

2570
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:27,760
Well, I don't quite know because it's
 

2571
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,190
Well, I don't quite know because it's
almost like this one's better at

2572
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:29,200
almost like this one's better at
 

2573
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,630
almost like this one's better at
everything except for this one, right?

2574
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
everything except for this one, right?
 

2575
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,549
everything except for this one, right?
But can anyone tell me how to make this

2576
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
But can anyone tell me how to make this
 

2577
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,430
But can anyone tell me how to make this
one constant time as well?

2578
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:37,440
one constant time as well?
 

2579
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,030
one constant time as well?
Augmentation, right? I could just store

2580
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,040
Augmentation, right? I could just store
 

2581
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,030
Augmentation, right? I could just store
in my sub trees the max or min, right?

2582
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:43,040
in my sub trees the max or min, right?
 

2583
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,870
in my sub trees the max or min, right?
And I can make this one strictly better

2584
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
And I can make this one strictly better
 

2585
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,710
And I can make this one strictly better
than this one, right? So in a theory

2586
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,720
than this one, right? So in a theory
 

2587
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,549
than this one, right? So in a theory
problem, you probably just want to use

2588
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
problem, you probably just want to use
 

2589
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,870
problem, you probably just want to use
this one, right? Uh here, hashts, direct

2590
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:52,880
this one, right? Uh here, hashts, direct
 

2591
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,829
this one, right? Uh here, hashts, direct
access arrays, even better for these

2592
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:55,839
access arrays, even better for these
 

2593
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,309
access arrays, even better for these
operations. That's great, but they suck

2594
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:58,319
operations. That's great, but they suck
 

2595
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,950
operations. That's great, but they suck
at these, right? So if you need these,

2596
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:00,960
at these, right? So if you need these,
 

2597
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,670
at these, right? So if you need these,
don't use these, right? And in actual

2598
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:03,680
don't use these, right? And in actual
 

2599
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,589
don't use these, right? And in actual
coding, right? Especially if you're

2600
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:05,599
coding, right? Especially if you're
 

2601
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,670
coding, right? Especially if you're
coding in a language that's not Python,

2602
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:07,680
coding in a language that's not Python,
 

2603
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,870
coding in a language that's not Python,
something that doesn't automatically

2604
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:08,880
something that doesn't automatically
 

2605
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,390
something that doesn't automatically
give you a hash table, right? If you're

2606
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:10,400
give you a hash table, right? If you're
 

2607
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,750
give you a hash table, right? If you're
in C in a microcontroller lab in in at

2608
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:13,760
in C in a microcontroller lab in in at
 

2609
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,430
in C in a microcontroller lab in in at
at MIT here, you're taking 615 or

2610
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440
at MIT here, you're taking 615 or
 

2611
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,630
at MIT here, you're taking 615 or
whatever, right? Like and you're doing

2612
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,640
whatever, right? Like and you're doing
 

2613
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,030
whatever, right? Like and you're doing
assembly, right? Usually what you're

2614
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040
assembly, right? Usually what you're
 

2615
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,750
assembly, right? Usually what you're
doing is a direct access stuff, right?

2616
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:23,760
doing is a direct access stuff, right?
 

2617
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,390
doing is a direct access stuff, right?
Because that's giving you the jumps that

2618
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:26,400
Because that's giving you the jumps that
 

2619
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,309
Because that's giving you the jumps that
you need in machine language to actually

2620
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:28,319
you need in machine language to actually
 

2621
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,630
you need in machine language to actually
go and access this and cause the time.

2622
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:30,640
go and access this and cause the time.
 

2623
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,230
go and access this and cause the time.
That's generally if you have control

2624
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,240
That's generally if you have control
 

2625
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,230
That's generally if you have control
over the keys that you're putting that

2626
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
over the keys that you're putting that
 

2627
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,910
over the keys that you're putting that
you're putting in your data structure.

2628
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:35,920
you're putting in your data structure.
 

2629
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,230
you're putting in your data structure.
You don't want this overhead of com

2630
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:38,240
You don't want this overhead of com
 

2631
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,589
You don't want this overhead of com
running your keys through a hash

2632
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:39,599
running your keys through a hash
 

2633
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,430
running your keys through a hash
function to look these things up. You

2634
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:41,440
function to look these things up. You
 

2635
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,109
function to look these things up. You
just store the things in array, right?

2636
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
just store the things in array, right?
 

2637
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,990
just store the things in array, right?
You use the hash table when you don't

2638
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
You use the hash table when you don't
 

2639
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,910
You use the hash table when you don't
have control over the keys or your keys

2640
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:49,920
have control over the keys or your keys
 

2641
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,790
have control over the keys or your keys
are like strings or something, right?

2642
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:52,800
are like strings or something, right?
 

2643
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,470
are like strings or something, right?
So that's when you use the hash table.

2644
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,480
So that's when you use the hash table.
 

2645
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,829
So that's when you use the hash table.
Now for our purposes usually you know a

2646
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
Now for our purposes usually you know a
 

2647
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,430
Now for our purposes usually you know a
hash table is just as good unless we're

2648
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440
hash table is just as good unless we're
 

2649
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,710
hash table is just as good unless we're
asking you for worstcase bounds right

2650
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
asking you for worstcase bounds right
 

2651
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,190
asking you for worstcase bounds right
and if we we're going to do this when we

2652
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
and if we we're going to do this when we
 

2653
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,630
and if we we're going to do this when we
talk about the data structures problem

2654
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:06,640
talk about the data structures problem
 

2655
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,510
talk about the data structures problem
if we give you a situation where we

2656
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
if we give you a situation where we
 

2657
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,710
if we give you a situation where we
don't care if you achieve worst case or

2658
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
don't care if you achieve worst case or
 

2659
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,230
don't care if you achieve worst case or
expected or amortized or any of these

2660
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
expected or amortized or any of these
 

2661
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,230
expected or amortized or any of these
things. We'll just say make sure you

2662
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
things. We'll just say make sure you
 

2663
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,069
things. We'll just say make sure you
state which one you achieve, right? And

2664
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:20,079
state which one you achieve, right? And
 

2665
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,829
state which one you achieve, right? And
as long as you analyzed it correctly

2666
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
as long as you analyzed it correctly
 

2667
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,270
as long as you analyzed it correctly
with respect to your data structures,

2668
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:23,280
with respect to your data structures,
 

2669
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,069
with respect to your data structures,
then you're fine, right? But if we say

2670
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:26,079
then you're fine, right? But if we say
 

2671
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,069
then you're fine, right? But if we say
you better do worst case here, I'm going

2672
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
you better do worst case here, I'm going
 

2673
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,589
you better do worst case here, I'm going
to slap you around, right? Then please

2674
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:31,599
to slap you around, right? Then please
 

2675
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,829
to slap you around, right? Then please
get those bounds, right? Don't don't use

2676
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
get those bounds, right? Don't don't use
 

2677
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,630
get those bounds, right? Don't don't use
a hash table in that case.

2678
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
a hash table in that case.
 

2679
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,670
a hash table in that case.
Does that make sense? Okay. Uh lastly,

2680
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:41,680
Does that make sense? Okay. Uh lastly,
 

2681
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,510
Does that make sense? Okay. Uh lastly,
we've got priority cues, which we talked

2682
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:43,520
we've got priority cues, which we talked
 

2683
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,190
we've got priority cues, which we talked
about. I'm not going to go through this

2684
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:45,200
about. I'm not going to go through this
 

2685
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,710
about. I'm not going to go through this
one very much. It's basically just

2686
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:46,720
one very much. It's basically just
 

2687
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,549
one very much. It's basically just
adding this to the thing. But act in

2688
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:50,559
adding this to the thing. But act in
 

2689
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,069
adding this to the thing. But act in
actuality, you can get all of these

2690
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
actuality, you can get all of these
 

2691
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,910
actuality, you can get all of these
bounds with a set AVL I mean a sequence

2692
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
bounds with a set AVL I mean a sequence
 

2693
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,190
bounds with a set AVL I mean a sequence
AVL tree with max or min augmentation

2694
00:55:59,190 --> 00:55:59,200
AVL tree with max or min augmentation
 

2695
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,950
AVL tree with max or min augmentation
which isn't on this list because we

2696
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:00,960
which isn't on this list because we
 

2697
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,470
which isn't on this list because we
didn't really talk about it but

2698
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:02,480
didn't really talk about it but
 

2699
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,789
didn't really talk about it but
hopefully you can

2700
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:04,799
hopefully you can
 

2701
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,030
hopefully you can
if you need these bounds without the

2702
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,040
if you need these bounds without the
 

2703
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,109
if you need these bounds without the
amortization then then you could achieve

2704
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:09,119
amortization then then you could achieve
 

2705
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,990
amortization then then you could achieve
them. Okay. All right. So those are

2706
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:12,000
them. Okay. All right. So those are
 

2707
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,829
them. Okay. All right. So those are
that's basically everything that we've

2708
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:13,839
that's basically everything that we've
 

2709
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,309
that's basically everything that we've
talked about in the class. Okay, we're

2710
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:16,319
talked about in the class. Okay, we're
 

2711
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,589
talked about in the class. Okay, we're
going to spend the rest of the time

2712
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
going to spend the rest of the time
 

2713
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,109
going to spend the rest of the time
working a couple data structures

2714
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:19,119
working a couple data structures
 

2715
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,510
working a couple data structures
problem. I'm not there's there's a

2716
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,520
problem. I'm not there's there's a
 

2717
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,950
problem. I'm not there's there's a
number of different types of questions

2718
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
number of different types of questions
 

2719
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,990
number of different types of questions
you'll actually um see

2720
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
you'll actually um see
 

2721
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,950
you'll actually um see
on uh on the quiz the practice quiz that

2722
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:28,960
on uh on the quiz the practice quiz that
 

2723
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,190
on uh on the quiz the practice quiz that
we gave you from last term. there's some

2724
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,200
we gave you from last term. there's some
 

2725
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,349
we gave you from last term. there's some
what I call mechanical type questions up

2726
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:33,359
what I call mechanical type questions up
 

2727
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,230
what I call mechanical type questions up
at at the front right then usually some

2728
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:36,240
at at the front right then usually some
 

2729
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,549
at at the front right then usually some
reduction type problems where you're

2730
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
reduction type problems where you're
 

2731
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,990
reduction type problems where you're
reducing to using some sorting

2732
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:40,000
reducing to using some sorting
 

2733
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,910
reducing to using some sorting
algorithms or some data structures and

2734
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
algorithms or some data structures and
 

2735
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,230
algorithms or some data structures and
then usually the la latter ones are ones

2736
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,240
then usually the la latter ones are ones
 

2737
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,829
then usually the la latter ones are ones
where you have to do some kind of

2738
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:45,839
where you have to do some kind of
 

2739
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,190
where you have to do some kind of
something additional like some

2740
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:47,200
something additional like some
 

2741
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,670
something additional like some
augmentation or some you know divide and

2742
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:49,680
augmentation or some you know divide and
 

2743
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,990
augmentation or some you know divide and
conquer or something like that right

2744
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:52,000
conquer or something like that right
 

2745
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,270
conquer or something like that right
okay uh so we're going to go ahead and

2746
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:55,280
okay uh so we're going to go ahead and
 

2747
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,950
okay uh so we're going to go ahead and
spend the rest of the time working a

2748
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:56,960
spend the rest of the time working a
 

2749
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,829
spend the rest of the time working a
couple of these problems uh these were

2750
00:56:59,829 --> 00:56:59,839
couple of these problems uh these were
 

2751
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:04,789
couple of these problems uh these were
from spring of 2019 on the exam. Uh uh

2752
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
from spring of 2019 on the exam. Uh uh
 

2753
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,470
from spring of 2019 on the exam. Uh uh
and actually one of the TAs who's uh

2754
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
and actually one of the TAs who's uh
 

2755
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,030
and actually one of the TAs who's uh
TAing for us now was also TA for us in

2756
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,040
TAing for us now was also TA for us in
 

2757
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,750
TAing for us now was also TA for us in
spring 19 was grading problem number two

2758
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:13,760
spring 19 was grading problem number two
 

2759
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,829
spring 19 was grading problem number two
here the rainy research problem and just

2760
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
here the rainy research problem and just
 

2761
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,630
here the rainy research problem and just
hated me because no one did it right. So

2762
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:18,640
hated me because no one did it right. So
 

2763
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,750
hated me because no one did it right. So
all right uh so

2764
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:21,760
all right uh so
 

2765
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,190
all right uh so
let's try to solve these problems. So

2766
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
let's try to solve these problems. So
 

2767
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,710
let's try to solve these problems. So
problem one, this is about restaurant

2768
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
problem one, this is about restaurant
 

2769
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,910
problem one, this is about restaurant
store. Yes. Okay.

2770
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:31,920
store. Yes. Okay.
 

2771
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,589
store. Yes. Okay.
All right. Uh so basically what's

2772
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
All right. Uh so basically what's
 

2773
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,270
All right. Uh so basically what's
happening? Uh popular restaurant,

2774
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
happening? Uh popular restaurant,
 

2775
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,150
happening? Uh popular restaurant,
criminal seafood.

2776
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:38,160
criminal seafood.
 

2777
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,710
criminal seafood.
What's the reference? Legal seafood.

2778
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
What's the reference? Legal seafood.
 

2779
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,470
What's the reference? Legal seafood.
Yes. Opposite. Does not take

2780
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,480
Yes. Opposite. Does not take
 

2781
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,309
Yes. Opposite. Does not take
reservations but maintains a wait list

2782
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:44,319
reservations but maintains a wait list
 

2783
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,309
reservations but maintains a wait list
where customers who have been on the

2784
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:46,319
where customers who have been on the
 

2785
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,630
where customers who have been on the
wait list longer are seated earlier. Uh

2786
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:48,640
wait list longer are seated earlier. Uh
 

2787
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,069
wait list longer are seated earlier. Uh
sometimes customers decide to eat

2788
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079
sometimes customers decide to eat
 

2789
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,750
sometimes customers decide to eat
somewhere else so the restaurant must

2790
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
somewhere else so the restaurant must
 

2791
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,150
somewhere else so the restaurant must
remove them from the weight list. Okay.

2792
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:54,160
remove them from the weight list. Okay.
 

2793
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,950
remove them from the weight list. Okay.
Uh assume that a customer has a

2794
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:56,960
Uh assume that a customer has a
 

2795
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,270
Uh assume that a customer has a
different name. No two customers are

2796
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,280
different name. No two customers are
 

2797
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,950
different name. No two customers are
added to the weight list at the exact

2798
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:00,960
added to the weight list at the exact
 

2799
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,950
added to the weight list at the exact
same time. Right? So there's an kind of

2800
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:02,960
same time. Right? So there's an kind of
 

2801
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,789
same time. Right? So there's an kind of
an ordering at which people are being

2802
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,799
an ordering at which people are being
 

2803
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,150
an ordering at which people are being
added to this weight list. Right? Does

2804
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:06,160
added to this weight list. Right? Does
 

2805
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,470
added to this weight list. Right? Does
that make sense? Uh design a database to

2806
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
that make sense? Uh design a database to
 

2807
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,069
that make sense? Uh design a database to
help criminal seafood maintain its

2808
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,079
help criminal seafood maintain its
 

2809
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,589
help criminal seafood maintain its
weight lists supporting the following

2810
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:11,599
weight lists supporting the following
 

2811
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,829
weight lists supporting the following
operations each in constant time. Okay.

2812
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:13,839
operations each in constant time. Okay.
 

2813
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,670
operations each in constant time. Okay.
So here we're we've refactored the

2814
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,680
So here we're we've refactored the
 

2815
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,950
So here we're we've refactored the
running time up to the top. Uh and it

2816
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:18,960
running time up to the top. Uh and it
 

2817
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,069
running time up to the top. Uh and it
said oh sorry I added the build here. I

2818
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
said oh sorry I added the build here. I
 

2819
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,270
said oh sorry I added the build here. I
guess that's still constant time. That's

2820
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,280
guess that's still constant time. That's
 

2821
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,230
guess that's still constant time. That's
fine. Okay. Yeah. State whether each

2822
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:26,240
fine. Okay. Yeah. State whether each
 

2823
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,430
fine. Okay. Yeah. State whether each
running time operation is uh worst case

2824
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,440
running time operation is uh worst case
 

2825
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,670
running time operation is uh worst case
amortize expenses. So when you see that

2826
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
amortize expenses. So when you see that
 

2827
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,670
amortize expenses. So when you see that
statement you're saying okay I'm allowed

2828
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
statement you're saying okay I'm allowed
 

2829
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,589
statement you're saying okay I'm allowed
to use a hash table if I want to right.

2830
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:37,599
to use a hash table if I want to right.
 

2831
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,150
to use a hash table if I want to right.
I just have to make sure if I use one, I

2832
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,160
I just have to make sure if I use one, I
 

2833
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,309
I just have to make sure if I use one, I
label my operations expected and

2834
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:42,319
label my operations expected and
 

2835
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,109
label my operations expected and
amortized when they occur, right? Which

2836
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:45,119
amortized when they occur, right? Which
 

2837
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,710
amortized when they occur, right? Which
which operations are expected?

2838
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:46,720
which operations are expected?
 

2839
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,630
which operations are expected?
Basically, all of them. Which operations

2840
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
Basically, all of them. Which operations
 

2841
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,870
Basically, all of them. Which operations
are amortized? The ones that changed

2842
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
are amortized? The ones that changed
 

2843
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,710
are amortized? The ones that changed
what's in the data structure, right?

2844
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:52,720
what's in the data structure, right?
 

2845
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,829
what's in the data structure, right?
Insert, delete. Okay, so we've got some

2846
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:55,839
Insert, delete. Okay, so we've got some
 

2847
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,470
Insert, delete. Okay, so we've got some
operations building an empty thing

2848
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:58,480
operations building an empty thing
 

2849
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,349
operations building an empty thing
adding a name. So, this name is X to the

2850
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:01,359
adding a name. So, this name is X to the
 

2851
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,870
adding a name. So, this name is X to the
back of the weight list. What do I know

2852
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:02,880
back of the weight list. What do I know
 

2853
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,270
back of the weight list. What do I know
about X? What do I know about the names

2854
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:05,280
about X? What do I know about the names
 

2855
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,190
about X? What do I know about the names
per our assumptions in this class?

2856
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:07,200
per our assumptions in this class?
 

2857
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,470
per our assumptions in this class?
They're all unique. So they can be a

2858
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:08,480
They're all unique. So they can be a
 

2859
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,549
They're all unique. So they can be a
key. They're unique so they can be a key

2860
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:10,559
key. They're unique so they can be a key
 

2861
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,230
key. They're unique so they can be a key
and

2862
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
and
 

2863
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,549
and
they fit in a constant number of words

2864
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:14,559
they fit in a constant number of words
 

2865
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,470
they fit in a constant number of words
by our assumption. Right? So I can

2866
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:16,480
by our assumption. Right? So I can
 

2867
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,309
by our assumption. Right? So I can
compare two of them in constant or I can

2868
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:18,319
compare two of them in constant or I can
 

2869
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,069
compare two of them in constant or I can
hash one in constant time. Right? That's

2870
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:20,079
hash one in constant time. Right? That's
 

2871
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,510
hash one in constant time. Right? That's
kind of the assumption we make on these

2872
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:21,520
kind of the assumption we make on these
 

2873
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,910
kind of the assumption we make on these
inputs. They're strings and I didn't

2874
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:23,920
inputs. They're strings and I didn't
 

2875
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,549
inputs. They're strings and I didn't
assign you a a bound on their length. So

2876
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:26,559
assign you a a bound on their length. So
 

2877
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,309
assign you a a bound on their length. So
you it's probably not something you need

2878
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
you it's probably not something you need
 

2879
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,589
you it's probably not something you need
to worry about. Right? Okay. Uh remove a

2880
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:31,599
to worry about. Right? Okay. Uh remove a
 

2881
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,349
to worry about. Right? Okay. Uh remove a
name, right? So already I'm feeling like

2882
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:35,359
name, right? So already I'm feeling like
 

2883
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:36,870
name, right? So already I'm feeling like
I need to be able to find things by

2884
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
I need to be able to find things by
 

2885
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,270
I need to be able to find things by
their name, right?

2886
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:39,280
their name, right?
 

2887
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,670
their name, right?
Okay. Uh and then see it's the next

2888
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:41,680
Okay. Uh and then see it's the next
 

2889
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,109
Okay. Uh and then see it's the next
person in line. Does that make sense? So

2890
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:45,119
person in line. Does that make sense? So
 

2891
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,789
person in line. Does that make sense? So
what kinds of things do I need to

2892
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:46,799
what kinds of things do I need to
 

2893
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,589
what kinds of things do I need to
maintain here? I I've I have people,

2894
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:49,599
maintain here? I I've I have people,
 

2895
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,750
maintain here? I I've I have people,
right? They have names and they have

2896
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,760
right? They have names and they have
 

2897
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,829
right? They have names and they have
kind of places, right? The time that

2898
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
kind of places, right? The time that
 

2899
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,390
kind of places, right? The time that
they came in, right? But am I given the

2900
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:56,400
they came in, right? But am I given the
 

2901
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,990
they came in, right? But am I given the
times?

2902
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000

 

2903
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,870

No, I'm not given times anywhere, right?

2904
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:02,880
No, I'm not given times anywhere, right?
 

2905
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,349
No, I'm not given times anywhere, right?
It's not on the inputs to my operations,

2906
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
It's not on the inputs to my operations,
 

2907
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,549
It's not on the inputs to my operations,
right? So, it's not like I'm going to be

2908
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
right? So, it's not like I'm going to be
 

2909
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,950
right? So, it's not like I'm going to be
able to key on times. Does that make

2910
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:08,960
able to key on times. Does that make
 

2911
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,549
able to key on times. Does that make
sense? What's the important part about

2912
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:10,559
sense? What's the important part about
 

2913
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,349
sense? What's the important part about
the times? The order, right? And you're

2914
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:13,359
the times? The order, right? And you're
 

2915
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,870
the times? The order, right? And you're
given that. Yeah. Basically, whenever

2916
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:16,880
given that. Yeah. Basically, whenever
 

2917
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,549
given that. Yeah. Basically, whenever
I'm I'm basically trying to maintain a

2918
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:18,559
I'm I'm basically trying to maintain a
 

2919
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,549
I'm I'm basically trying to maintain a
sequence on these guys, right? There's a

2920
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:20,559
sequence on these guys, right? There's a
 

2921
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,109
sequence on these guys, right? There's a
front one and a back one and people in

2922
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:23,119
front one and a back one and people in
 

2923
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,630
front one and a back one and people in
the middle, right? And I want to make

2924
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:24,640
the middle, right? And I want to make
 

2925
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,309
the middle, right? And I want to make
sure that order stays the same or else

2926
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:26,319
sure that order stays the same or else
 

2927
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,670
sure that order stays the same or else
people are going to get angry at me,

2928
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:27,680
people are going to get angry at me,
 

2929
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,990
people are going to get angry at me,
right? because ah they came here after

2930
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,000
right? because ah they came here after
 

2931
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,750
right? because ah they came here after
me and yeah right you've been in that

2932
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:33,760
me and yeah right you've been in that
 

2933
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,789
me and yeah right you've been in that
situation. Okay, so uh we're trying to

2934
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:36,799
situation. Okay, so uh we're trying to
 

2935
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,470
situation. Okay, so uh we're trying to
maintain some kind of sequence an

2936
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:38,480
maintain some kind of sequence an
 

2937
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,670
maintain some kind of sequence an
exttrinsic order on these things, right?

2938
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:41,680
exttrinsic order on these things, right?
 

2939
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,190
exttrinsic order on these things, right?
But we're also needing to be able to

2940
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
But we're also needing to be able to
 

2941
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,670
But we're also needing to be able to
look up people by their name because I

2942
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:45,680
look up people by their name because I
 

2943
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,950
look up people by their name because I
want to be able to change this thing,

2944
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:46,960
want to be able to change this thing,
 

2945
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,430
want to be able to change this thing,
right? Does this maybe sound familiar to

2946
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,440
right? Does this maybe sound familiar to
 

2947
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,549
right? Does this maybe sound familiar to
some other problem we had on this pro

2948
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
some other problem we had on this pro
 

2949
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,510
some other problem we had on this pro
this terms problem sets? Yeah, I think

2950
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:55,520
this terms problem sets? Yeah, I think
 

2951
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,589
this terms problem sets? Yeah, I think
there was a problem where uh

2952
01:00:59,589 --> 01:00:59,599
there was a problem where uh
 

2953
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,829
there was a problem where uh
the chat, right? Right. You had to store

2954
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:01,839
the chat, right? Right. You had to store
 

2955
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,829
the chat, right? Right. You had to store
a sequence, right? But you also had this

2956
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:03,839
a sequence, right? But you also had this
 

2957
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,109
a sequence, right? But you also had this
dictionary that you had to look things

2958
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:05,119
dictionary that you had to look things
 

2959
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,190
dictionary that you had to look things
up, right? Now, the nice thing about

2960
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:07,200
up, right? Now, the nice thing about
 

2961
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,150
up, right? Now, the nice thing about
that um

2962
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,160
that um
 

2963
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,549
that um
situation, right, is that the things

2964
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:12,559
situation, right, is that the things
 

2965
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,190
situation, right, is that the things
that you needed to look up on was

2966
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,200
that you needed to look up on was
 

2967
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,990
that you needed to look up on was
static, right? And so what could I use

2968
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
static, right? And so what could I use
 

2969
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,069
static, right? And so what could I use
for my dictionary, my my set data

2970
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:20,079
for my dictionary, my my set data
 

2971
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,390
for my dictionary, my my set data
structure for that?

2972
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:22,400
structure for that?
 

2973
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,349
structure for that?
Anyone remember?

2974
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
Anyone remember?
 

2975
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:26,870
Anyone remember?
You could just use a sorted array,

2976
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
You could just use a sorted array,
 

2977
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,710
You could just use a sorted array,
right? Because it's static, these things

2978
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:28,720
right? Because it's static, these things
 

2979
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,789
right? Because it's static, these things
aren't updating all the time, right? And

2980
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:30,799
aren't updating all the time, right? And
 

2981
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,710
aren't updating all the time, right? And
so it was fine for me to just use a

2982
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:32,720
so it was fine for me to just use a
 

2983
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,069
so it was fine for me to just use a
static array. Right? Here uh uh and and

2984
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,079
static array. Right? Here uh uh and and
 

2985
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,990
static array. Right? Here uh uh and and
we gave you lookup times that were worst

2986
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
we gave you lookup times that were worst
 

2987
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,390
we gave you lookup times that were worst
case logarithmic. Right? Here I'm asking

2988
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:42,400
case logarithmic. Right? Here I'm asking
 

2989
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,670
case logarithmic. Right? Here I'm asking
for constant time. Right? Sort AVL

2990
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
for constant time. Right? Sort AVL
 

2991
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,430
for constant time. Right? Sort AVL
sorted array is not going to cut it. Set

2992
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
sorted array is not going to cut it. Set
 

2993
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,789
sorted array is not going to cut it. Set
AVL is not going to cut it. That's what

2994
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
AVL is not going to cut it. That's what
 

2995
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,510
AVL is not going to cut it. That's what
I'm going to use. A dynamic array or a

2996
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:51,520
I'm going to use. A dynamic array or a
 

2997
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,990
I'm going to use. A dynamic array or a
hash table. Right? Now dynamic array

2998
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,000
hash table. Right? Now dynamic array
 

2999
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,670
hash table. Right? Now dynamic array
might not be great because I don't

3000
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:55,680
might not be great because I don't
 

3001
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,750
might not be great because I don't
actually have a numeric bound on how big

3002
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760
actually have a numeric bound on how big
 

3003
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,270
actually have a numeric bound on how big
these keys are. I just know that they

3004
01:01:59,270 --> 01:01:59,280
these keys are. I just know that they
 

3005
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,630
these keys are. I just know that they
fit in words, right? So I can't actually

3006
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:02,640
fit in words, right? So I can't actually
 

3007
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,789
fit in words, right? So I can't actually
make a direct access array because those

3008
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:04,799
make a direct access array because those
 

3009
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,390
make a direct access array because those
words while they fit in a constant

3010
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
words while they fit in a constant
 

3011
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,150
words while they fit in a constant
number of words, I don't know if the

3012
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,160
number of words, I don't know if the
 

3013
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,510
number of words, I don't know if the
integer representation of those are

3014
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:09,520
integer representation of those are
 

3015
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,750
integer representation of those are
polinomially bounded.

3016
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:11,760
polinomially bounded.
 

3017
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,910
polinomially bounded.
Does that make sense? Right? So I I do

3018
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:13,920
Does that make sense? Right? So I I do
 

3019
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,430
Does that make sense? Right? So I I do
want to use hashing in this in this

3020
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
want to use hashing in this in this
 

3021
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,109
want to use hashing in this in this
case. Right? And so what do I want to

3022
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:17,119
case. Right? And so what do I want to
 

3023
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,990
case. Right? And so what do I want to
maintain? I want to maintain

3024
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
maintain? I want to maintain
 

3025
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,230
maintain? I want to maintain
a sequence data structure

3026
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240

 

3027
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,270

uh on

3028
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
uh on
 

3029
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,390
uh on
customers.

3030
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:30,400

 

3031
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,710

Customers is there a U in there

3032
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:32,720
Customers is there a U in there
 

3033
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,630
Customers is there a U in there
somewhere? No, this is right. Right.

3034
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:34,640
somewhere? No, this is right. Right.
 

3035
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,589
somewhere? No, this is right. Right.
Okay. And a set

3036
01:02:37,589 --> 01:02:37,599
Okay. And a set
 

3037
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,349
Okay. And a set
uh

3038
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
uh
 

3039
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,109
uh
mapping.

3040
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,119
mapping.
 

3041
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,030
mapping.
So you this is usually how I do it. Like

3042
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:43,040
So you this is usually how I do it. Like
 

3043
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,390
So you this is usually how I do it. Like
I want to say a set keyed on something.

3044
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
I want to say a set keyed on something.
 

3045
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,309
I want to say a set keyed on something.
If it's just a set, then I just have it

3046
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
If it's just a set, then I just have it
 

3047
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,150
If it's just a set, then I just have it
keyed, right? I can look up whether that

3048
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,160
keyed, right? I can look up whether that
 

3049
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,710
keyed, right? I can look up whether that
thing is there or not. But when it's I'm

3050
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:52,720
thing is there or not. But when it's I'm
 

3051
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,630
thing is there or not. But when it's I'm
I'm actually having it mapped to

3052
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:54,640
I'm actually having it mapped to
 

3053
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,549
I'm actually having it mapped to
something else, I'll say, you know,

3054
01:02:56,549 --> 01:02:56,559
something else, I'll say, you know,
 

3055
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,829
something else, I'll say, you know,
mapping a key space to something else.

3056
01:02:59,829 --> 01:02:59,839
mapping a key space to something else.
 

3057
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,750
mapping a key space to something else.
Usually the item that I'm storing or

3058
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
Usually the item that I'm storing or
 

3059
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,589
Usually the item that I'm storing or
maybe some property of the items that

3060
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:03,599
maybe some property of the items that
 

3061
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:04,870
maybe some property of the items that
I'm storing, right? Does that make

3062
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
I'm storing, right? Does that make
 

3063
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,670
I'm storing, right? Does that make
sense? Okay. So, mapping, what do I map

3064
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
sense? Okay. So, mapping, what do I map
 

3065
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,670
sense? Okay. So, mapping, what do I map
here?

3066
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:09,680
here?
 

3067
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,510
here?
Names, right?

3068
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520

 

3069
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,109

to

3070
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
to
 

3071
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:20,710
to
oh to what do I want to map

3072
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720

 

3073
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,670

the time the time that they entered

3074
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:23,680
the time the time that they entered
 

3075
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,309
the time the time that they entered
do I want to do that well we can't

3076
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:26,319
do I want to do that well we can't
 

3077
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,589
do I want to do that well we can't
exactly do it with the time that they

3078
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:27,599
exactly do it with the time that they
 

3079
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,270
exactly do it with the time that they
enter but the sequence and the customers

3080
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
enter but the sequence and the customers
 

3081
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,670
enter but the sequence and the customers
will show what's next and yeah kind of I

3082
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:31,680
will show what's next and yeah kind of I
 

3083
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,910
will show what's next and yeah kind of I
want to I want to store it to where it

3084
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:33,920
want to I want to store it to where it
 

3085
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,069
want to I want to store it to where it
is in this sequence right so I'll just

3086
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
is in this sequence right so I'll just
 

3087
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,069
is in this sequence right so I'll just
store the index where it is in the

3088
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:38,079
store the index where it is in the
 

3089
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,670
store the index where it is in the
sequence and I can just look it up right

3090
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:39,680
sequence and I can just look it up right
 

3091
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,150
sequence and I can just look it up right
that sounds

3092
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,160
that sounds
 

3093
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,109
that sounds
Yeah. Is that what I heard? Indices

3094
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
Yeah. Is that what I heard? Indices
 

3095
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,029
Yeah. Is that what I heard? Indices
change. Yeah. Indices change every time

3096
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:47,039
change. Yeah. Indices change every time
 

3097
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,750
change. Yeah. Indices change every time
I add or remove things, right?

3098
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:49,760
I add or remove things, right?
 

3099
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,349
I add or remove things, right?
Ah, yeah. Store a pointer, right?

3100
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:53,359
Ah, yeah. Store a pointer, right?
 

3101
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,630
Ah, yeah. Store a pointer, right?
Pointer

3102
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640

 

3103
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,349

to place

3104
01:03:59,349 --> 01:03:59,359
to place
 

3105
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:03,270
to place
in sequence. Now, uh that's a little

3106
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:03,280
in sequence. Now, uh that's a little
 

3107
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,750
in sequence. Now, uh that's a little
weird to say because I haven't told you

3108
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
weird to say because I haven't told you
 

3109
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,710
weird to say because I haven't told you
how I represented this sequence,

3110
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:08,720
how I represented this sequence,
 

3111
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,390
how I represented this sequence,
right? But you know conceptually I can

3112
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,400
right? But you know conceptually I can
 

3113
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,390
right? But you know conceptually I can
say I'm storing a pointer to some place

3114
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:14,400
say I'm storing a pointer to some place
 

3115
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,910
say I'm storing a pointer to some place
in this that represents where it is.

3116
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
in this that represents where it is.
 

3117
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,510
in this that represents where it is.
I'll deal with the details of that

3118
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
I'll deal with the details of that
 

3119
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,029
I'll deal with the details of that
later. Okay. Right. But generally I call

3120
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:21,039
later. Okay. Right. But generally I call
 

3121
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,710
later. Okay. Right. But generally I call
this a linked data structure. Right?

3122
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:22,720
this a linked data structure. Right?
 

3123
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,950
this a linked data structure. Right?
Because I'm linking between two data

3124
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
Because I'm linking between two data
 

3125
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,470
Because I'm linking between two data
structures. Right? So that I can do a

3126
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:28,480
structures. Right? So that I can do a
 

3127
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,230
structures. Right? So that I can do a
query in one say and find out where it

3128
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:30,240
query in one say and find out where it
 

3129
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,190
query in one say and find out where it
is in the other. Right? Or do a query in

3130
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:33,200
is in the other. Right? Or do a query in
 

3131
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,630
is in the other. Right? Or do a query in
the other. That kind of thing. Okay. So

3132
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
the other. That kind of thing. Okay. So
 

3133
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,710
the other. That kind of thing. Okay. So
everyone kind of understands why I chose

3134
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:38,720
everyone kind of understands why I chose
 

3135
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,029
everyone kind of understands why I chose
these things, right? How I approach this

3136
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
these things, right? How I approach this
 

3137
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,430
these things, right? How I approach this
problem. Yeah. Um not sure how a pointer

3138
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:45,440
problem. Yeah. Um not sure how a pointer
 

3139
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,390
problem. Yeah. Um not sure how a pointer
fixes the problem of just storing an

3140
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:48,400
fixes the problem of just storing an
 

3141
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,230
fixes the problem of just storing an
index, you know, like the the place that

3142
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:52,240
index, you know, like the the place that
 

3143
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,069
index, you know, like the the place that
the person is at in the sequence is

3144
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:54,079
the person is at in the sequence is
 

3145
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,589
the person is at in the sequence is
going to change over time. Are we

3146
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:55,599
going to change over time. Are we
 

3147
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,349
going to change over time. Are we
assuming that the pointer updates with

3148
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
assuming that the pointer updates with
 

3149
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:01,750
assuming that the pointer updates with
that change? So, okay. So, let's say uh

3150
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:01,760
that change? So, okay. So, let's say uh
 

3151
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,710
that change? So, okay. So, let's say uh
if if every time So, let's say I'm

3152
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:04,720
if if every time So, let's say I'm
 

3153
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,230
if if every time So, let's say I'm
storing let's say I'm storing this

3154
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
storing let's say I'm storing this
 

3155
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,309
storing let's say I'm storing this
sequence in a link list. Let's just say

3156
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:08,319
sequence in a link list. Let's just say
 

3157
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:09,589
sequence in a link list. Let's just say
because I know that I'm going to have to

3158
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:09,599
because I know that I'm going to have to
 

3159
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,109
because I know that I'm going to have to
be inserting and deleting things from

3160
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:11,119
be inserting and deleting things from
 

3161
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,270
be inserting and deleting things from
the middle of this thing. Does that make

3162
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:13,280
the middle of this thing. Does that make
 

3163
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,349
the middle of this thing. Does that make
sense? All right. So, I'm going to go

3164
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:15,359
sense? All right. So, I'm going to go
 

3165
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,510
sense? All right. So, I'm going to go
ahead and say that this is going to be a

3166
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,520
ahead and say that this is going to be a
 

3167
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,630
ahead and say that this is going to be a
linked list. Okay. And now I have this

3168
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
linked list. Okay. And now I have this
 

3169
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,990
linked list. Okay. And now I have this
linked list.

3170
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,000
linked list.
 

3171
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,390
linked list.
Okay. So if I said all right this set

3172
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:28,400
Okay. So if I said all right this set
 

3173
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,950
Okay. So if I said all right this set
data structure in my set

3174
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
data structure in my set
 

3175
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,390
data structure in my set
stores point or stores where it is in

3176
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
stores point or stores where it is in
 

3177
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,950
stores point or stores where it is in
the link list right I say it's stored at

3178
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
the link list right I say it's stored at
 

3179
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,670
the link list right I say it's stored at
at uh k right cool

3180
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:43,680
at uh k right cool
 

3181
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,630
at uh k right cool
now if I see it's this guy right I stick

3182
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:48,640
now if I see it's this guy right I stick
 

3183
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,789
now if I see it's this guy right I stick
him at his table right every index has

3184
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:52,799
him at his table right every index has
 

3185
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,069
him at his table right every index has
changed right so for me to update the

3186
01:05:56,069 --> 01:05:56,079
changed right so for me to update the
 

3187
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:57,990
changed right so for me to update the
indexes stored in this set data

3188
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
indexes stored in this set data
 

3189
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,829
indexes stored in this set data
structure, I have to change every single

3190
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
structure, I have to change every single
 

3191
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,150
structure, I have to change every single
one of them. Yeah. Does that make sense?

3192
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
one of them. Yeah. Does that make sense?
 

3193
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,150
one of them. Yeah. Does that make sense?
Yeah. No, this makes way more sense.

3194
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:04,160
Yeah. No, this makes way more sense.
 

3195
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,150
Yeah. No, this makes way more sense.
Yeah. So, really what I want not to

3196
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,160
Yeah. So, really what I want not to
 

3197
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,069
Yeah. So, really what I want not to
store a number here, but an actual

3198
01:06:08,069 --> 01:06:08,079
store a number here, but an actual
 

3199
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,910
store a number here, but an actual
pointer to the node that's containing

3200
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:09,920
pointer to the node that's containing
 

3201
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,630
pointer to the node that's containing
this thing, right? Because the node

3202
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
this thing, right? Because the node
 

3203
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,950
this thing, right? Because the node
isn't changing unless that thing left my

3204
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
isn't changing unless that thing left my
 

3205
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,109
isn't changing unless that thing left my
data structure, right? the node, the

3206
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:17,119
data structure, right? the node, the
 

3207
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,109
data structure, right? the node, the
address of the this thing in memory, the

3208
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:19,119
address of the this thing in memory, the
 

3209
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,670
address of the this thing in memory, the
the the node is just a little container

3210
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:21,680
the the node is just a little container
 

3211
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,990
the the node is just a little container
that contains an item and a next

3212
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,000
that contains an item and a next
 

3213
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,349
that contains an item and a next
pointer. And actually, we're going to

3214
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:25,359
pointer. And actually, we're going to
 

3215
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:28,470
pointer. And actually, we're going to
need a previous pointer here,

3216
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:28,480
need a previous pointer here,
 

3217
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,990
need a previous pointer here,
right? We're going to need a double

3218
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000
right? We're going to need a double
 

3219
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,710
right? We're going to need a double
length list, right? Because what we're

3220
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
length list, right? Because what we're
 

3221
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,630
length list, right? Because what we're
going to do when we remove something, we

3222
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:34,640
going to do when we remove something, we
 

3223
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,029
going to do when we remove something, we
need to stitch it back together in

3224
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:37,039
need to stitch it back together in
 

3225
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,029
need to stitch it back together in
constant time, which means we need to

3226
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:39,039
constant time, which means we need to
 

3227
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,190
constant time, which means we need to
know what's the one front of us and the

3228
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,200
know what's the one front of us and the
 

3229
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,710
know what's the one front of us and the
one behind us, right? Yeah. Okay. All

3230
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:44,720
one behind us, right? Yeah. Okay. All
 

3231
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,910
one behind us, right? Yeah. Okay. All
right. So link list here we already said

3232
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:47,920
right. So link list here we already said
 

3233
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,109
right. So link list here we already said
maybe using a hash table here

3234
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:53,119

 

3235
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:57,029

right and so okay great

3236
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
right and so okay great
 

3237
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,789
right and so okay great
this is basically enough for me to say

3238
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:00,799
this is basically enough for me to say
 

3239
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,109
this is basically enough for me to say
this is my data structure these are the

3240
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
this is my data structure these are the
 

3241
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,870
this is my data structure these are the
invariants what are the invariants it's

3242
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:04,880
invariants what are the invariants it's
 

3243
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,430
invariants what are the invariants it's
storing all the customers right that's

3244
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,440
storing all the customers right that's
 

3245
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,270
storing all the customers right that's
an invar I mean it's not a very strong

3246
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
an invar I mean it's not a very strong
 

3247
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,789
an invar I mean it's not a very strong
invariant but it's I mean I I should say

3248
01:07:12,789 --> 01:07:12,799
invariant but it's I mean I I should say
 

3249
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,390
invariant but it's I mean I I should say
that right I'm storing all the customers

3250
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
that right I'm storing all the customers
 

3251
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,990
that right I'm storing all the customers
because I'm going to have to make sure

3252
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,000
because I'm going to have to make sure
 

3253
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,150
because I'm going to have to make sure
that I'm maintaining that when I do a

3254
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,160
that I'm maintaining that when I do a
 

3255
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,270
that I'm maintaining that when I do a
query, right? Uh and then here set

3256
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,280
query, right? Uh and then here set
 

3257
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,789
query, right? Uh and then here set
mapping names to pointers, right? That

3258
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:24,799
mapping names to pointers, right? That
 

3259
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,150
mapping names to pointers, right? That
place in this thing, right? And as I

3260
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:28,160
place in this thing, right? And as I
 

3261
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,910
place in this thing, right? And as I
remove things, I need to make sure that

3262
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:29,920
remove things, I need to make sure that
 

3263
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,990
remove things, I need to make sure that
invariant stays the same, right? It's

3264
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,000
invariant stays the same, right? It's
 

3265
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,750
invariant stays the same, right? It's
still mapping all the names of customers

3266
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:33,760
still mapping all the names of customers
 

3267
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,950
still mapping all the names of customers
that I have in my thing to their nodes.

3268
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
that I have in my thing to their nodes.
 

3269
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,069
that I have in my thing to their nodes.
Okay? So when something leaves, I better

3270
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:40,079
Okay? So when something leaves, I better
 

3271
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:41,510
Okay? So when something leaves, I better
need to make sure that both of these

3272
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
need to make sure that both of these
 

3273
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,670
need to make sure that both of these
things are updated. Does that make

3274
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:43,680
things are updated. Does that make
 

3275
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,190
things are updated. Does that make
sense? Okay, so how do I maintain these

3276
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,200
sense? Okay, so how do I maintain these
 

3277
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,470
sense? Okay, so how do I maintain these
operations? We've got a build. Build

3278
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:50,480
operations? We've got a build. Build
 

3279
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,109
operations? We've got a build. Build
just sets up empty of these things,

3280
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:53,119
just sets up empty of these things,
 

3281
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,230
just sets up empty of these things,
right? So you just say that, right? I

3282
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:56,240
right? So you just say that, right? I
 

3283
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,109
right? So you just say that, right? I
build an empty linked list, doubly

3284
01:07:59,109 --> 01:07:59,119
build an empty linked list, doubly
 

3285
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,430
build an empty linked list, doubly
linked list on the customers and I build

3286
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:01,440
linked list on the customers and I build
 

3287
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,069
linked list on the customers and I build
a a set uh a hash table mapping nothing

3288
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:06,079
a a set uh a hash table mapping nothing
 

3289
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,630
a a set uh a hash table mapping nothing
to nothing right now. Right. Okay. So

3290
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:08,640
to nothing right now. Right. Okay. So
 

3291
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,230
to nothing right now. Right. Okay. So
that's build. I'm gonna be precise here

3292
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,240
that's build. I'm gonna be precise here
 

3293
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,270
that's build. I'm gonna be precise here
and actually write down the thing

3294
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,280
and actually write down the thing
 

3295
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,630
and actually write down the thing
because I told you not to uh

3296
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:18,640
because I told you not to uh
 

3297
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,669
because I told you not to uh
not to ignore a operation or else we

3298
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
not to ignore a operation or else we
 

3299
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,229
not to ignore a operation or else we
can't give you points for it. The next

3300
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:24,239
can't give you points for it. The next
 

3301
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:27,030
can't give you points for it. The next
one. Yeah. By empty by building an empty

3302
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,040
one. Yeah. By empty by building an empty
 

3303
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,990
one. Yeah. By empty by building an empty
list you mean like it just has like the

3304
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,000
list you mean like it just has like the
 

3305
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,669
list you mean like it just has like the
head and the tail are set to none but

3306
01:08:31,669 --> 01:08:31,679
head and the tail are set to none but
 

3307
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,390
head and the tail are set to none but
like it exists. Yeah. Right. It's it's a

3308
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
like it exists. Yeah. Right. It's it's a
 

3309
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,870
like it exists. Yeah. Right. It's it's a
thing in memory that we store. It has a

3310
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
thing in memory that we store. It has a
 

3311
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,789
thing in memory that we store. It has a
pointer to a head and a tail. Those are

3312
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:38,799
pointer to a head and a tail. Those are
 

3313
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,910
pointer to a head and a tail. Those are
none right now but we will add things to

3314
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:41,920
none right now but we will add things to
 

3315
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,430
none right now but we will add things to
it. Right? Okay. So the second one add

3316
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,440
it. Right? Okay. So the second one add
 

3317
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:50,870
it. Right? Okay. So the second one add
name right.

3318
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:50,880

 

3319
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,630

What do we have to say? We have to

3320
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
What do we have to say? We have to
 

3321
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,149
What do we have to say? We have to
update this data structure so it

3322
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:54,159
update this data structure so it
 

3323
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:57,110
update this data structure so it
maintains it to variance. Right? I have

3324
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,120
maintains it to variance. Right? I have
 

3325
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,789
maintains it to variance. Right? I have
to usually I start with one of them. Uh

3326
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:00,799
to usually I start with one of them. Uh
 

3327
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,269
to usually I start with one of them. Uh
I get to a point where oh I really

3328
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:03,279
I get to a point where oh I really
 

3329
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,269
I get to a point where oh I really
should have updated the other one first.

3330
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
should have updated the other one first.
 

3331
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,510
should have updated the other one first.
Right? So sometimes it's hit or miss.

3332
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
Right? So sometimes it's hit or miss.
 

3333
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,669
Right? So sometimes it's hit or miss.
What do I want to do here? Well, I have

3334
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:09,679
What do I want to do here? Well, I have
 

3335
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,229
What do I want to do here? Well, I have
no idea where in this sequence this is,

3336
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:12,239
no idea where in this sequence this is,
 

3337
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:14,149
no idea where in this sequence this is,
right? So, I kind of have to go here

3338
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
right? So, I kind of have to go here
 

3339
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:16,550
right? So, I kind of have to go here
first, right?

3340
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,560
first, right?
 

3341
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,990
first, right?
Oh, sorry. Adding a guy I could do

3342
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:20,000
Oh, sorry. Adding a guy I could do
 

3343
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,229
Oh, sorry. Adding a guy I could do
either way, right? I know where is he

3344
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:22,239
either way, right? I know where is he
 

3345
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:25,510
either way, right? I know where is he
going to go? End of the list, right? So,

3346
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:25,520
going to go? End of the list, right? So,
 

3347
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,829
going to go? End of the list, right? So,
I can just stick it there, right? So,

3348
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:29,839
I can just stick it there, right? So,
 

3349
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,749
I can just stick it there, right? So,
add

3350
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:31,759
add
 

3351
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:38,229
add
x to end of sequence. All right. So I

3352
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:38,239
x to end of sequence. All right. So I
 

3353
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:40,070
x to end of sequence. All right. So I
already come to a trick that I like,

3354
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
already come to a trick that I like,
 

3355
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,870
already come to a trick that I like,
right? Sequence set. Okay, in this

3356
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
right? Sequence set. Okay, in this
 

3357
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,470
right? Sequence set. Okay, in this
instance I only have one sequence in one

3358
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:46,480
instance I only have one sequence in one
 

3359
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,870
instance I only have one sequence in one
set and so calling them sequence and set

3360
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:48,880
set and so calling them sequence and set
 

3361
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,950
set and so calling them sequence and set
it's probably fine, right? I'm not going

3362
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:50,960
it's probably fine, right? I'm not going
 

3363
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,390
it's probably fine, right? I'm not going
to confuse the greater I'm not going to

3364
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
to confuse the greater I'm not going to
 

3365
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,430
to confuse the greater I'm not going to
confuse myself, right? But when I have

3366
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
confuse myself, right? But when I have
 

3367
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,430
confuse myself, right? But when I have
more than one of these things or even

3368
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
more than one of these things or even
 

3369
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,990
more than one of these things or even
for brevity on an exam where I'm, you

3370
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:00,000
for brevity on an exam where I'm, you
 

3371
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,990
for brevity on an exam where I'm, you
know, time constrained, give these

3372
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:02,000
know, time constrained, give these
 

3373
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,550
know, time constrained, give these
things a name, right? Say this is a

3374
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:04,560
things a name, right? Say this is a
 

3375
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,030
things a name, right? Say this is a
sequence uh C and M I don't know I see

3376
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,040
sequence uh C and M I don't know I see
 

3377
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,669
sequence uh C and M I don't know I see
customer here I see map here so you know

3378
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:11,679
customer here I see map here so you know
 

3379
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,310
customer here I see map here so you know
maybe I don't know right but just give

3380
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:14,320
maybe I don't know right but just give
 

3381
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,630
maybe I don't know right but just give
them a letter and we can follow you much

3382
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:16,640
them a letter and we can follow you much
 

3383
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,470
them a letter and we can follow you much
more clearly and you can refer to these

3384
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
more clearly and you can refer to these
 

3385
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,189
more clearly and you can refer to these
things more precisely right so end of C

3386
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
things more precisely right so end of C
 

3387
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,189
things more precisely right so end of C
okay

3388
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:25,199
okay
 

3389
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:28,790
okay
uh then what do we have to do I fix this

3390
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,800
uh then what do we have to do I fix this
 

3391
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,510
uh then what do we have to do I fix this
guy this guy's good now I have to fix

3392
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:31,520
guy this guy's good now I have to fix
 

3393
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,310
guy this guy's good now I have to fix
this guy so I add x to the set and I map

3394
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:36,320
this guy so I add x to the set and I map
 

3395
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,630
this guy so I add x to the set and I map
it back to that node that I just came

3396
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,640
it back to that node that I just came
 

3397
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,910
it back to that node that I just came
from. Right? I could store it in a

3398
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:39,920
from. Right? I could store it in a
 

3399
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,229
from. Right? I could store it in a
temporary variable, right? Add

3400
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:44,239
temporary variable, right? Add
 

3401
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:50,550
temporary variable, right? Add
uh x to m pointing

3402
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:50,560
uh x to m pointing
 

3403
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,669
uh x to m pointing
to

3404
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:53,679

 

3405
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,470

in node

3406
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:56,480
in node
 

3407
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,550
in node
v to v. Okay, cool.

3408
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:00,560
v to v. Okay, cool.
 

3409
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,709
v to v. Okay, cool.
So I added my X to the end of C into a

3410
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:04,719
So I added my X to the end of C into a
 

3411
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,310
So I added my X to the end of C into a
node V, right? I'm kind of hold I

3412
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,320
node V, right? I'm kind of hold I
 

3413
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,390
node V, right? I'm kind of hold I
labeled it so I can reference it later,

3414
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:10,400
labeled it so I can reference it later,
 

3415
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,030
labeled it so I can reference it later,
right? And kind of in code I would

3416
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:13,040
right? And kind of in code I would
 

3417
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,750
right? And kind of in code I would
probably remember what that node was.

3418
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
probably remember what that node was.
 

3419
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,750
probably remember what that node was.
Add X to M pointing to that node. Right?

3420
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:19,760
Add X to M pointing to that node. Right?
 

3421
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,350
Add X to M pointing to that node. Right?
And now I've maintained my invariant.

3422
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360
And now I've maintained my invariant.
 

3423
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,229
And now I've maintained my invariant.
Great. Maybe what's next? Uh add

3424
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
Great. Maybe what's next? Uh add
 

3425
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,390
Great. Maybe what's next? Uh add
key X

3426
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:28,400
key X
 

3427
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:33,910
key X
or add add X to M having the key of X

3428
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:33,920
or add add X to M having the key of X
 

3429
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,830
or add add X to M having the key of X
point to that note. Does that make

3430
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:35,840
point to that note. Does that make
 

3431
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,950
point to that note. Does that make
sense? There's a subtlety there. Okay.

3432
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:38,960
sense? There's a subtlety there. Okay.
 

3433
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,470
sense? There's a subtlety there. Okay.
Three,

3434
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:40,480
Three,
 

3435
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,110
Three,
we have remove.

3436
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:43,120
we have remove.
 

3437
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,270
we have remove.
I don't remember the name whatever.

3438
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:45,280
I don't remember the name whatever.
 

3439
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,950
I don't remember the name whatever.
Okay.

3440
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:46,960
Okay.
 

3441
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,270
Okay.
So here we have to do the order matters,

3442
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:49,280
So here we have to do the order matters,
 

3443
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,709
So here we have to do the order matters,
right? I don't know where it is in the

3444
01:11:50,709 --> 01:11:50,719
right? I don't know where it is in the
 

3445
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,350
right? I don't know where it is in the
sequence,

3446
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:53,360
sequence,
 

3447
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,270
sequence,
but I'm going to look it up in the set.

3448
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,280
but I'm going to look it up in the set.
 

3449
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,149
but I'm going to look it up in the set.
I'm going to remove it from the set, and

3450
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:58,159
I'm going to remove it from the set, and
 

3451
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,830
I'm going to remove it from the set, and
I'm going to look at whatever it points

3452
01:11:59,830 --> 01:11:59,840
I'm going to look at whatever it points
 

3453
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,750
I'm going to look at whatever it points
to and remove it from the sequence.

3454
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:01,760
to and remove it from the sequence.
 

3455
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,510
to and remove it from the sequence.
Okay, I'm running out of time a little

3456
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:03,520
Okay, I'm running out of time a little
 

3457
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,630
Okay, I'm running out of time a little
bit here, so I'm not going to write all

3458
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:04,640
bit here, so I'm not going to write all
 

3459
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,390
bit here, so I'm not going to write all
that down, but you guys understand what

3460
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,400
that down, but you guys understand what
 

3461
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,470
that down, but you guys understand what
that means. Here, we're using the fact

3462
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:08,480
that means. Here, we're using the fact
 

3463
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,189
that means. Here, we're using the fact
that it's a doubly linked list so that

3464
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:11,199
that it's a doubly linked list so that
 

3465
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,189
that it's a doubly linked list so that
we can relink things together. You don't

3466
01:12:13,189 --> 01:12:13,199
we can relink things together. You don't
 

3467
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,590
we can relink things together. You don't
have to tell me

3468
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:15,600
have to tell me
 

3469
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,709
have to tell me
repoint the previous pointer of my next

3470
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:18,719
repoint the previous pointer of my next
 

3471
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,830
repoint the previous pointer of my next
thing to the next the right you don't

3472
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:21,840
thing to the next the right you don't
 

3473
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,270
thing to the next the right you don't
have to tell me how to relink those

3474
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
have to tell me how to relink those
 

3475
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,270
have to tell me how to relink those
pointers because we did that already in

3476
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:25,280
pointers because we did that already in
 

3477
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,709
pointers because we did that already in
problem set one or whatever right just

3478
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:28,719
problem set one or whatever right just
 

3479
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,470
problem set one or whatever right just
in general is there any situation for

3480
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
in general is there any situation for
 

3481
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,189
in general is there any situation for
where using non not a double link list

3482
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:33,199
where using non not a double link list
 

3483
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,470
where using non not a double link list
like just a link list would be better

3484
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:34,480
like just a link list would be better
 

3485
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,750
like just a link list would be better
than double link list because it seems

3486
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:35,760
than double link list because it seems
 

3487
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,590
than double link list because it seems
like it always solves problems yeah

3488
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:37,600
like it always solves problems yeah
 

3489
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,510
like it always solves problems yeah
double link list is almost always

3490
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:39,520
double link list is almost always
 

3491
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,590
double link list is almost always
strictly better than a single link list

3492
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:41,600
strictly better than a single link list
 

3493
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:47,669
strictly better than a single link list
in theory problems So yeah, use it.

3494
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:47,679

 

3495
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:55,189

Okay. Uh and then seat last one.

3496
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:55,199

 

3497
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,030

That's just

3498
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,040
That's just
 

3499
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,390
That's just
take the front of the sequence, remove

3500
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
take the front of the sequence, remove
 

3501
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,709
take the front of the sequence, remove
it,

3502
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:02,719
it,
 

3503
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,270
it,
change the head around. But I I get that

3504
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,280
change the head around. But I I get that
 

3505
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,110
change the head around. But I I get that
you can delete first, right? You're

3506
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,120
you can delete first, right? You're
 

3507
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,350
you can delete first, right? You're
reducing to the interface that we had.

3508
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
reducing to the interface that we had.
 

3509
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,669
reducing to the interface that we had.
You're deleting first on this sequence.

3510
01:13:11,669 --> 01:13:11,679
You're deleting first on this sequence.
 

3511
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,430
You're deleting first on this sequence.
Okay, but now we have a situation. I I

3512
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
Okay, but now we have a situation. I I
 

3513
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,910
Okay, but now we have a situation. I I
deleted the first guy. How do I know who

3514
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:17,920
deleted the first guy. How do I know who
 

3515
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,229
deleted the first guy. How do I know who
the first guy is? Well, I'm storing its

3516
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:20,239
the first guy is? Well, I'm storing its
 

3517
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,070
the first guy is? Well, I'm storing its
name in there, right? I'm storing the

3518
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,080
name in there, right? I'm storing the
 

3519
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,830
name in there, right? I'm storing the
names of these customers. So, I know who

3520
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
names of these customers. So, I know who
 

3521
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,910
names of these customers. So, I know who
was at the front.

3522
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
was at the front.
 

3523
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,550
was at the front.
I look in this set data structure and I

3524
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
I look in this set data structure and I
 

3525
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,790
I look in this set data structure and I
remove that entry. Does that make sense?

3526
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
remove that entry. Does that make sense?
 

3527
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,510
remove that entry. Does that make sense?
Because now I no longer need to maintain

3528
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:33,520
Because now I no longer need to maintain
 

3529
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,229
Because now I no longer need to maintain
where he goes. Now, in actuality,

3530
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:36,239
where he goes. Now, in actuality,
 

3531
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,750
where he goes. Now, in actuality,
I could just not update this set data

3532
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:39,760
I could just not update this set data
 

3533
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,870
I could just not update this set data
structure. But if I do that then well my

3534
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:42,880
structure. But if I do that then well my
 

3535
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,470
structure. But if I do that then well my
running times are still linear time

3536
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:44,480
running times are still linear time
 

3537
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,390
running times are still linear time
right I'm not giving you a bound on

3538
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:46,400
right I'm not giving you a bound on
 

3539
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,470
right I'm not giving you a bound on
space I'm I'm still constant time sorry

3540
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:50,480
space I'm I'm still constant time sorry
 

3541
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,310
space I'm I'm still constant time sorry
so you don't actually have to do that

3542
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,320
so you don't actually have to do that
 

3543
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,910
so you don't actually have to do that
removal but uh if that customer comes

3544
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:55,920
removal but uh if that customer comes
 

3545
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,430
removal but uh if that customer comes
back and wants to get on the wait list

3546
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:57,440
back and wants to get on the wait list
 

3547
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,990
back and wants to get on the wait list
again right you're right there there are

3548
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:00,000
again right you're right there there are
 

3549
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,830
again right you're right there there are
things to consider right

3550
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:03,840
things to consider right
 

3551
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,110
things to consider right
okay so that's that question

3552
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,120
okay so that's that question
 

3553
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:11,510
okay so that's that question
next question last 10 minutes or So, uh,

3554
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
next question last 10 minutes or So, uh,
 

3555
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,709
next question last 10 minutes or So, uh,
rainy research. This was a problem that

3556
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:16,719
rainy research. This was a problem that
 

3557
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,310
rainy research. This was a problem that
people had nightmares about.

3558
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:20,320
people had nightmares about.
 

3559
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,110
people had nightmares about.
Okay. So, basically, we've got uh Mother

3560
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,120
Okay. So, basically, we've got uh Mother
 

3561
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,270
Okay. So, basically, we've got uh Mother
Wan.

3562
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:25,280
Wan.
 

3563
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,830
Wan.
He's a weatherman. Uh, a scientist who

3564
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:27,840
He's a weatherman. Uh, a scientist who
 

3565
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,430
He's a weatherman. Uh, a scientist who
uh studies global rainfall. Uh, and he's

3566
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
uh studies global rainfall. Uh, and he's
 

3567
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,470
uh studies global rainfall. Uh, and he's
got a bunch of uh uh sensors everywhere.

3568
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
got a bunch of uh uh sensors everywhere.
 

3569
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,950
got a bunch of uh uh sensors everywhere.
And each one can post to the cloud or

3570
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
And each one can post to the cloud or
 

3571
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,790
And each one can post to the cloud or
something a measurement that's of the

3572
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:38,800
something a measurement that's of the
 

3573
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,470
something a measurement that's of the
form a triple of integers R, L, and T,

3574
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
form a triple of integers R, L, and T,
 

3575
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,149
form a triple of integers R, L, and T,
where R is a positive amount of

3576
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:44,159
where R is a positive amount of
 

3577
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,310
where R is a positive amount of
rainfall, an integer, uh a latitude,

3578
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:48,320
rainfall, an integer, uh a latitude,
 

3579
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,950
rainfall, an integer, uh a latitude,
uh an integer again, and at a time.

3580
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:50,960
uh an integer again, and at a time.
 

3581
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,470
uh an integer again, and at a time.
Okay, so we got three things to deal

3582
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:52,480
Okay, so we got three things to deal
 

3583
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,870
Okay, so we got three things to deal
with here. Yuck. Okay. Uh but they're

3584
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:56,880
with here. Yuck. Okay. Uh but they're
 

3585
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,790
with here. Yuck. Okay. Uh but they're
all integers. And don't be like, "Oh,

3586
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:58,800
all integers. And don't be like, "Oh,
 

3587
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:03,189
all integers. And don't be like, "Oh,
well, Jason, latitudes are pretty small,

3588
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:03,199
well, Jason, latitudes are pretty small,
 

3589
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:06,229
well, Jason, latitudes are pretty small,
so I can assume these integers are small

3590
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:06,239
so I can assume these integers are small
 

3591
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,550
so I can assume these integers are small
and these things take constant time,

3592
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,560
and these things take constant time,
 

3593
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,229
and these things take constant time,
right? I'm not specifying to you a

3594
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:10,239
right? I'm not specifying to you a
 

3595
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,470
right? I'm not specifying to you a
resolution at which I'm measuring these

3596
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:12,480
resolution at which I'm measuring these
 

3597
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,630
resolution at which I'm measuring these
integers. So, and I haven't given you a

3598
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:14,640
integers. So, and I haven't given you a
 

3599
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,550
integers. So, and I haven't given you a
bound between what that resolution is

3600
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
bound between what that resolution is
 

3601
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,910
bound between what that resolution is
compared to the number of measurements

3602
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:17,920
compared to the number of measurements
 

3603
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,990
compared to the number of measurements
that I have. So, don't play those games.

3604
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:20,000
that I have. So, don't play those games.
 

3605
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,709
that I have. So, don't play those games.
Okay? Uh the peak rainfall at a given

3606
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:22,719
Okay? Uh the peak rainfall at a given
 

3607
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,030
Okay? Uh the peak rainfall at a given
latitude

3608
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
latitude
 

3609
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,630
latitude
since a particular time is the maximum

3610
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:28,640
since a particular time is the maximum
 

3611
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,270
since a particular time is the maximum
rainfall at any measurement at that

3612
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:31,280
rainfall at any measurement at that
 

3613
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,070
rainfall at any measurement at that
latitude measured at a time greater than

3614
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:34,080
latitude measured at a time greater than
 

3615
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,470
latitude measured at a time greater than
or equal to that time. Does that make

3616
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
or equal to that time. Does that make
 

3617
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,709
or equal to that time. Does that make
sense? Or zero if there aren't

3618
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
sense? Or zero if there aren't
 

3619
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,790
sense? Or zero if there aren't
measurements at that latitude. Okay,

3620
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:40,800
measurements at that latitude. Okay,
 

3621
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,189
measurements at that latitude. Okay,
just or after the time or before the

3622
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:43,199
just or after the time or before the
 

3623
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:45,669
just or after the time or before the
time or whatever. Describe a data base

3624
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
time or whatever. Describe a data base
 

3625
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,470
time or whatever. Describe a data base
that we can build it and cause the time.

3626
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:48,480
that we can build it and cause the time.
 

3627
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,830
that we can build it and cause the time.
Right. uh is an empty one. I added this

3628
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
Right. uh is an empty one. I added this
 

3629
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,310
Right. uh is an empty one. I added this
one because we weren't good about that

3630
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
one because we weren't good about that
 

3631
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,750
one because we weren't good about that
last spring. Uh record data, we give you

3632
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:57,760
last spring. Uh record data, we give you
 

3633
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,189
last spring. Uh record data, we give you
a triplet and then so record data for it

3634
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:01,199
a triplet and then so record data for it
 

3635
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,350
a triplet and then so record data for it
to be correct, I just have to maintain

3636
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
to be correct, I just have to maintain
 

3637
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,430
to be correct, I just have to maintain
that information. Right. Right. For

3638
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:05,440
that information. Right. Right. For
 

3639
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,470
that information. Right. Right. For
these kind of updates, I don't I it's

3640
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:08,480
these kind of updates, I don't I it's
 

3641
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,990
these kind of updates, I don't I it's
really hard for me to argue that this

3642
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,000
really hard for me to argue that this
 

3643
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,709
really hard for me to argue that this
thing is correct. Right. Because I just,

3644
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:12,719
thing is correct. Right. Because I just,
 

3645
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,229
thing is correct. Right. Because I just,
you know, I throw it at the database.

3646
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:14,239
you know, I throw it at the database.
 

3647
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:15,830
you know, I throw it at the database.
The data basease doesn't have to give

3648
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:15,840
The data basease doesn't have to give
 

3649
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,590
The data basease doesn't have to give
anything back to me, right? So the the

3650
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:19,600
anything back to me, right? So the the
 

3651
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,950
anything back to me, right? So the the
important thing here about correctness

3652
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:20,960
important thing here about correctness
 

3653
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,590
important thing here about correctness
is that peak rainfall gives it to me and

3654
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:23,600
is that peak rainfall gives it to me and
 

3655
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,430
is that peak rainfall gives it to me and
it gives it to me in the time bound that

3656
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
it gives it to me in the time bound that
 

3657
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,709
it gives it to me in the time bound that
I'm looking for. And peak rainfall is

3658
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:26,719
I'm looking for. And peak rainfall is
 

3659
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,550
I'm looking for. And peak rainfall is
returning the peak rainfall at a

3660
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:28,560
returning the peak rainfall at a
 

3661
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,310
returning the peak rainfall at a
particular latitude since t. Okay. So we

3662
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
particular latitude since t. Okay. So we
 

3663
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,430
particular latitude since t. Okay. So we
have three things. Yep. Given that we

3664
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
have three things. Yep. Given that we
 

3665
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,189
have three things. Yep. Given that we
never have to like return a single

3666
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
never have to like return a single
 

3667
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,750
never have to like return a single
measurement is that we don't need to

3668
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,760
measurement is that we don't need to
 

3669
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,270
measurement is that we don't need to
have a record of it. There's the

3670
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:41,280
have a record of it. There's the
 

3671
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,430
have a record of it. There's the
potential that you don't need to store

3672
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:43,440
potential that you don't need to store
 

3673
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,750
potential that you don't need to store
all of the information because all we're

3674
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
all of the information because all we're
 

3675
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,870
all of the information because all we're
doing is giving you back RS essentially.

3676
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:48,880
doing is giving you back RS essentially.
 

3677
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,630
doing is giving you back RS essentially.
Right? It's possible that you don't need

3678
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
Right? It's possible that you don't need
 

3679
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,070
Right? It's possible that you don't need
to store the latitudes or times at all.

3680
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,080
to store the latitudes or times at all.
 

3681
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,430
to store the latitudes or times at all.
Right? You don't even need to store the

3682
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
Right? You don't even need to store the
 

3683
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,070
Right? You don't even need to store the
triplets. Now, in reality, I'm querying

3684
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
triplets. Now, in reality, I'm querying
 

3685
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,149
triplets. Now, in reality, I'm querying
on the latitudes and the times. So, I I

3686
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:02,159
on the latitudes and the times. So, I I
 

3687
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,229
on the latitudes and the times. So, I I
should store them somewhere, but I might

3688
01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:04,239
should store them somewhere, but I might
 

3689
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:06,310
should store them somewhere, but I might
be able to compress them. in particular,

3690
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:06,320
be able to compress them. in particular,
 

3691
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,350
be able to compress them. in particular,
right? Many things could be stored at

3692
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,360
right? Many things could be stored at
 

3693
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,070
right? Many things could be stored at
the same latitude, right? That's kind of

3694
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:12,080
the same latitude, right? That's kind of
 

3695
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,390
the same latitude, right? That's kind of
the whole point of the query. And so we

3696
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
the whole point of the query. And so we
 

3697
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,030
the whole point of the query. And so we
want I mean, we may only need to store

3698
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,040
want I mean, we may only need to store
 

3699
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,470
want I mean, we may only need to store
that latitude once. Does that make

3700
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:18,480
that latitude once. Does that make
 

3701
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,110
that latitude once. Does that make
sense? Okay, I'm I'm going to wait for

3702
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:21,120
sense? Okay, I'm I'm going to wait for
 

3703
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,630
sense? Okay, I'm I'm going to wait for
questions until after because I want to

3704
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:22,640
questions until after because I want to
 

3705
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,270
questions until after because I want to
get to a solution to this problem. All

3706
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:25,280
get to a solution to this problem. All
 

3707
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,149
get to a solution to this problem. All
right, so uh what do we need to do? We

3708
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:28,159
right, so uh what do we need to do? We
 

3709
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:30,310
right, so uh what do we need to do? We
need to be able to add things and I want

3710
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:30,320
need to be able to add things and I want
 

3711
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,390
need to be able to add things and I want
to return. So return, I'm going to have

3712
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,400
to return. So return, I'm going to have
 

3713
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,709
to return. So return, I'm going to have
to query something, right? And then I'm

3714
01:17:34,709 --> 01:17:34,719
to query something, right? And then I'm
 

3715
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:35,990
to query something, right? And then I'm
going to return something, right? So

3716
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,000
going to return something, right? So
 

3717
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,709
going to return something, right? So
return peak rainfall at latitude L since

3718
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:38,719
return peak rainfall at latitude L since
 

3719
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,030
return peak rainfall at latitude L since
time t.

3720
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
time t.
 

3721
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,390
time t.
What do I care about in a particular

3722
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:42,400
What do I care about in a particular
 

3723
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,030
What do I care about in a particular
query? I I only care about all the

3724
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
query? I I only care about all the
 

3725
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:49,270
query? I I only care about all the
things at L, right? At a latitude L. So

3726
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:49,280
things at L, right? At a latitude L. So
 

3727
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,390
things at L, right? At a latitude L. So
really I this isn't such an interesting

3728
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:52,400
really I this isn't such an interesting
 

3729
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,310
really I this isn't such an interesting
thing, but I want to be able to have

3730
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:54,320
thing, but I want to be able to have
 

3731
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,910
thing, but I want to be able to have
maybe many data structures, one

3732
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
maybe many data structures, one
 

3733
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,990
maybe many data structures, one
associated with each L. Does that make

3734
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,000
associated with each L. Does that make
 

3735
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,590
associated with each L. Does that make
sense? Right. And how can I find one in

3736
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:01,600
sense? Right. And how can I find one in
 

3737
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,189
sense? Right. And how can I find one in
each L right quickly?

3738
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:05,199
each L right quickly?
 

3739
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:06,870
each L right quickly?
put it in a dictionary. What's my time

3740
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:06,880
put it in a dictionary. What's my time
 

3741
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,030
put it in a dictionary. What's my time
bound? Worst case log N. Right? So what

3742
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,040
bound? Worst case log N. Right? So what
 

3743
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,310
bound? Worst case log N. Right? So what
data structure did I use for that set

3744
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
data structure did I use for that set
 

3745
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,510
data structure did I use for that set
data structure? A set AVL. Right? So

3746
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:13,520
data structure? A set AVL. Right? So
 

3747
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:20,070
data structure? A set AVL. Right? So
we're going to first have a uh set AVL

3748
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:20,080

 

3749
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:25,030

uh say L

3750
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:25,040
uh say L
 

3751
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:29,910
uh say L
uh mapping

3752
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:29,920

 

3753
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,590

latitudes

3754
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:33,600

 

3755
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,189

to

3756
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:35,199
to
 

3757
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:36,790
to
well now we have more data structures

3758
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
well now we have more data structures
 

3759
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,149
well now we have more data structures
right I want to store a lot of the

3760
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:38,159
right I want to store a lot of the
 

3761
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,990
right I want to store a lot of the
things that have the same latitudes in

3762
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:40,000
things that have the same latitudes in
 

3763
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,550
things that have the same latitudes in
another data structure right the ones is

3764
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:42,560
another data structure right the ones is
 

3765
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,310
another data structure right the ones is
probably

3766
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
probably
 

3767
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,990
probably
storing the times and the rainfalls of

3768
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,000
storing the times and the rainfalls of
 

3769
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,790
storing the times and the rainfalls of
all those measurements. Yeah.

3770
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:48,800
all those measurements. Yeah.
 

3771
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,910
all those measurements. Yeah.
Uh yeah, a hash table. A hash table.

3772
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:51,920
Uh yeah, a hash table. A hash table.
 

3773
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,830
Uh yeah, a hash table. A hash table.
Okay. So, what kinds of query am I going

3774
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:53,840
Okay. So, what kinds of query am I going
 

3775
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,910
Okay. So, what kinds of query am I going
to want to do on the things at the same

3776
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:55,920
to want to do on the things at the same
 

3777
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,830
to want to do on the things at the same
latitude? Um you're going to want to get

3778
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:57,840
latitude? Um you're going to want to get
 

3779
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,830
latitude? Um you're going to want to get
the times. I'm going to want to get the

3780
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
the times. I'm going to want to get the
 

3781
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,149
the times. I'm going to want to get the
times, but more than that, I'm doing

3782
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:02,159
times, but more than that, I'm doing
 

3783
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,630
times, but more than that, I'm doing
kind of a an ordered query, right? I

3784
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:04,640
kind of a an ordered query, right? I
 

3785
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,990
kind of a an ordered query, right? I
need the things less than a certain

3786
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,000
need the things less than a certain
 

3787
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,390
need the things less than a certain
time, right?

3788
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
time, right?
 

3789
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,270
time, right?
Greater. Also, it's just just a second.

3790
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,280
Greater. Also, it's just just a second.
 

3791
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,270
Greater. Also, it's just just a second.
You should do like an AVL for the time

3792
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,280
You should do like an AVL for the time
 

3793
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,229
You should do like an AVL for the time
and an AVL for the rain. Okay. Do I care

3794
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:16,239
and an AVL for the rain. Okay. Do I care
 

3795
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:18,709
and an AVL for the rain. Okay. Do I care
about an AVL for the rain? Do Am I

3796
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:18,719
about an AVL for the rain? Do Am I
 

3797
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,470
about an AVL for the rain? Do Am I
looking up on the rainfall?

3798
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480
looking up on the rainfall?
 

3799
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,950
looking up on the rainfall?
No. No. Right. So, I'm going to go ahead

3800
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
No. No. Right. So, I'm going to go ahead
 

3801
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,310
No. No. Right. So, I'm going to go ahead
and store these things in a time sorted

3802
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,320
and store these things in a time sorted
 

3803
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,430
and store these things in a time sorted
AVL, right? To

3804
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
AVL, right? To
 

3805
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:35,590
AVL, right? To
uh mapping latitude

3806
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:35,600
uh mapping latitude
 

3807
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,870
uh mapping latitude
L to I'm going to call this data

3808
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:38,880
L to I'm going to call this data
 

3809
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,550
L to I'm going to call this data
structure a time data structure, right?

3810
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:40,560
structure a time data structure, right?
 

3811
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,830
structure a time data structure, right?
I'm going to say it's T of L. Okay, that

3812
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
I'm going to say it's T of L. Okay, that
 

3813
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,110
I'm going to say it's T of L. Okay, that
kind of looks like a recurrence. So,

3814
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
kind of looks like a recurrence. So,
 

3815
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,550
kind of looks like a recurrence. So,
it's a little irking me right now, but I

3816
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:46,560
it's a little irking me right now, but I
 

3817
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,750
it's a little irking me right now, but I
don't have anything better. All right,

3818
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:47,760
don't have anything better. All right,
 

3819
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,310
don't have anything better. All right,
so now each one of these time data

3820
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,320
so now each one of these time data
 

3821
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,270
so now each one of these time data
structures, right, is

3822
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
structures, right, is
 

3823
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:58,470
structures, right, is
a set AVL

3824
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:58,480
a set AVL
 

3825
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,669
a set AVL
mapping

3826
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:01,679

 

3827
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,510

time

3828
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:03,520
time
 

3829
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,310
time
to the, you know, the rainfall

3830
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:06,320
to the, you know, the rainfall
 

3831
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,030
to the, you know, the rainfall
measurement, right?

3832
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:09,040
measurement, right?
 

3833
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,229
measurement, right?
All right.

3834
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
All right.
 

3835
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,870
All right.
So that's going to if my query was

3836
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:12,880
So that's going to if my query was
 

3837
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,550
So that's going to if my query was
return the peak rainfall, sorry, return

3838
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:16,560
return the peak rainfall, sorry, return
 

3839
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,550
return the peak rainfall, sorry, return
the rainfall

3840
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:18,560
the rainfall
 

3841
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,790
the rainfall
of the thing with latitude L and time T,

3842
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:22,800
of the thing with latitude L and time T,
 

3843
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,870
of the thing with latitude L and time T,
we'd be done kind of, right? You you'd

3844
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:24,880
we'd be done kind of, right? You you'd
 

3845
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,510
we'd be done kind of, right? You you'd
know how to support that query, right? I

3846
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520
know how to support that query, right? I
 

3847
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,510
know how to support that query, right? I
to insert things, I insert things into

3848
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:29,520
to insert things, I insert things into
 

3849
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,590
to insert things, I insert things into
both data structures. I just look it up,

3850
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:31,600
both data structures. I just look it up,
 

3851
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,470
both data structures. I just look it up,
right? The one complication here is that

3852
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:34,480
right? The one complication here is that
 

3853
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,070
right? The one complication here is that
I'm not asking for what is the rainfall

3854
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,080
I'm not asking for what is the rainfall
 

3855
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,550
I'm not asking for what is the rainfall
at a particular time. I want know what

3856
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
at a particular time. I want know what
 

3857
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,229
at a particular time. I want know what
the maximum rainfall is up to this time.

3858
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:44,239
the maximum rainfall is up to this time.
 

3859
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,350
the maximum rainfall is up to this time.
Okay, so max heap's good if I want to

3860
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,360
Okay, so max heap's good if I want to
 

3861
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,750
Okay, so max heap's good if I want to
know the global max, right? But here I

3862
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:49,760
know the global max, right? But here I
 

3863
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,229
know the global max, right? But here I
want to know the max bounded by a

3864
01:20:52,229 --> 01:20:52,239
want to know the max bounded by a
 

3865
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:56,229
want to know the max bounded by a
certain range. Okay, so I we're gonna

3866
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:56,239
certain range. Okay, so I we're gonna
 

3867
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:57,830
certain range. Okay, so I we're gonna
you can ask me questions after this.

3868
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
you can ask me questions after this.
 

3869
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,750
you can ask me questions after this.
We're running out of time a little bit.

3870
01:20:59,750 --> 01:20:59,760
We're running out of time a little bit.
 

3871
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,750
We're running out of time a little bit.
Okay. So, anyone have an idea for how?

3872
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:03,760
Okay. So, anyone have an idea for how?
 

3873
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,470
Okay. So, anyone have an idea for how?
Yeah. You just augment the the with the

3874
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:06,480
Yeah. You just augment the the with the
 

3875
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,310
Yeah. You just augment the the with the
max. Okay. You can just look at the

3876
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:08,320
max. Okay. You can just look at the
 

3877
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,070
max. Okay. You can just look at the
right child and just look at the max of

3878
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
right child and just look at the max of
 

3879
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,310
right child and just look at the max of
that. Ah, okay. So, what your colleague

3880
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:12,320
that. Ah, okay. So, what your colleague
 

3881
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,830
that. Ah, okay. So, what your colleague
is saying, if we augment by the max R in

3882
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
is saying, if we augment by the max R in
 

3883
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,229
is saying, if we augment by the max R in
my subree,

3884
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239
my subree,
 

3885
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,870
my subree,
maybe we can use that to figure out this

3886
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
maybe we can use that to figure out this
 

3887
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,950
maybe we can use that to figure out this
query. Right? Because we're ordered on

3888
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:22,960
query. Right? Because we're ordered on
 

3889
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,669
query. Right? Because we're ordered on
T, right? we have this nice monotonic

3890
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:25,679
T, right? we have this nice monotonic
 

3891
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,709
T, right? we have this nice monotonic
property that everything that's going to

3892
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:28,719
property that everything that's going to
 

3893
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:33,030
property that everything that's going to
be in my query, right? Everything to the

3894
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,040
be in my query, right? Everything to the
 

3895
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,229
be in my query, right? Everything to the
right of a certain time, right? If if my

3896
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
right of a certain time, right? If if my
 

3897
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:40,870
right of a certain time, right? If if my
time is uh in is above t, right, at a

3898
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:40,880
time is uh in is above t, right, at a
 

3899
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,630
time is uh in is above t, right, at a
particular node, then everything in my

3900
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:42,640
particular node, then everything in my
 

3901
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,669
particular node, then everything in my
right subree is also above that t,

3902
01:21:45,669 --> 01:21:45,679
right subree is also above that t,
 

3903
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:48,630
right subree is also above that t,
right? Because of the order of my set's

3904
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:48,640
right? Because of the order of my set's
 

3905
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,830
right? Because of the order of my set's
data structure, right? Because I'm

3906
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:49,840
data structure, right? Because I'm
 

3907
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,629
data structure, right? Because I'm
ordered on times, right? So there's

3908
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:52,639
ordered on times, right? So there's
 

3909
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,550
ordered on times, right? So there's
maybe the possibility that if I look to

3910
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:54,560
maybe the possibility that if I look to
 

3911
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,830
maybe the possibility that if I look to
my right subree, I can not do work all

3912
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:57,840
my right subree, I can not do work all
 

3913
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,110
my right subree, I can not do work all
over here by just looking at the max in

3914
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:01,120
over here by just looking at the max in
 

3915
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,430
over here by just looking at the max in
that subree. Right? So that's an idea of

3916
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:03,440
that subree. Right? So that's an idea of
 

3917
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:08,470
that subree. Right? So that's an idea of
let's say augmented

3918
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:08,480

 

3919
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,070

3920

3922
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:12,560
subtree
 

3923
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,910

max r. Okay, you probably want to give

3924
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:15,920
max r. Okay, you probably want to give
 

3925
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,830
max r. Okay, you probably want to give
this a name as well, right? So like v

3926
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:19,840
this a name as well, right? So like v
 

3927
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,910
this a name as well, right? So like v
max, right?

3928
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:21,920
max, right?
 

3929
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,310
max, right?
where V is a node in my sub in my thing,

3930
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:24,320
where V is a node in my sub in my thing,
 

3931
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,870
where V is a node in my sub in my thing,
right? And I want to show how to support

3932
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
right? And I want to show how to support
 

3933
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,870
right? And I want to show how to support
this, right? How I can compute that from

3934
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
this, right? How I can compute that from
 

3935
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,870
this, right? How I can compute that from
its children. So, how do I actually

3936
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:30,880
its children. So, how do I actually
 

3937
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,149
its children. So, how do I actually
support this query, right? I can think

3938
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:34,159
support this query, right? I can think
 

3939
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:37,910
support this query, right? I can think
of it recursively, right? I have a

3940
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:37,920
of it recursively, right? I have a
 

3941
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,149
of it recursively, right? I have a
couple cases. If I add a V here, I want

3942
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:42,159
couple cases. If I add a V here, I want
 

3943
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:44,470
couple cases. If I add a V here, I want
to define a recursive function that's

3944
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:44,480
to define a recursive function that's
 

3945
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,070
to define a recursive function that's
called uh, you know, peak

3946
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,080
called uh, you know, peak
 

3947
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,430
called uh, you know, peak
peak rainfall of a given node.

3948
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
peak rainfall of a given node.
 

3949
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:55,910
peak rainfall of a given node.
lower bounded by a t. Okay.

3950
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:55,920
lower bounded by a t. Okay.
 

3951
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,470
lower bounded by a t. Okay.
So if I'm here, there's two cases,

3952
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:58,480
So if I'm here, there's two cases,
 

3953
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:02,790
So if I'm here, there's two cases,
right? Either my t my time is bigger or

3954
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:02,800
right? Either my t my time is bigger or
 

3955
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,990
right? Either my t my time is bigger or
small is in my range or out of my range,

3956
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:06,000
small is in my range or out of my range,
 

3957
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,990
small is in my range or out of my range,
right? If it's out of my range, what do

3958
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000
right? If it's out of my range, what do
 

3959
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,990
right? If it's out of my range, what do
I do? Right? It's lower than my time

3960
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:10,000
I do? Right? It's lower than my time
 

3961
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,070
I do? Right? It's lower than my time
bound.

3962
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,080
bound.
 

3963
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,990
bound.
I can just recursively call this

3964
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,000
I can just recursively call this
 

3965
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,470
I can just recursively call this
function on this node, right? because I

3966
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:16,480
function on this node, right? because I
 

3967
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,470
function on this node, right? because I
know that any

3968
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:18,480
know that any
 

3969
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,629
know that any
thing is going to be down here that I

3970
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:20,639
thing is going to be down here that I
 

3971
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,350
thing is going to be down here that I
care about, right?

3972
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:23,360
care about, right?
 

3973
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,189
care about, right?
And that's just one recursive call down

3974
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:25,199
And that's just one recursive call down
 

3975
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,830
And that's just one recursive call down
the tree, right? And so if I only limit

3976
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:27,840
the tree, right? And so if I only limit
 

3977
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,590
the tree, right? And so if I only limit
myself to one recursive call down the

3978
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:29,600
myself to one recursive call down the
 

3979
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,470
myself to one recursive call down the
tree, I'm always going down each time.

3980
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:32,480
tree, I'm always going down each time.
 

3981
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,229
tree, I'm always going down each time.
This is going to take logarithmic time,

3982
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:34,239
This is going to take logarithmic time,
 

3983
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:35,830
This is going to take logarithmic time,
right? Okay, so that's the first case.

3984
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
right? Okay, so that's the first case.
 

3985
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,990
right? Okay, so that's the first case.
That's the easy case, right? This thing

3986
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:38,000
That's the easy case, right? This thing
 

3987
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,709
That's the easy case, right? This thing
is not in range. I return recursively

3988
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:40,719
is not in range. I return recursively
 

3989
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,550
is not in range. I return recursively
the thing to my right. What's the other

3990
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:42,560
the thing to my right. What's the other
 

3991
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,390
the thing to my right. What's the other
case? I'm in my range, right?

3992
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:46,400
case? I'm in my range, right?
 

3993
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,310
case? I'm in my range, right?
Well, now I could return recursively

3994
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:48,320
Well, now I could return recursively
 

3995
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,590
Well, now I could return recursively
call both sides, right? Because that's

3996
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,600
call both sides, right? Because that's
 

3997
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,669
call both sides, right? Because that's
what this this peak is talking about.

3998
01:23:53,669 --> 01:23:53,679
what this this peak is talking about.
 

3999
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:55,750
what this this peak is talking about.
What's my peak rainfall? But if I do

4000
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:55,760
What's my peak rainfall? But if I do
 

4001
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,830
What's my peak rainfall? But if I do
that, if I call it here recursively and

4002
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:57,840
that, if I call it here recursively and
 

4003
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,750
that, if I call it here recursively and
I call it here recursively, that could

4004
01:23:59,750 --> 01:23:59,760
I call it here recursively, that could
 

4005
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,350
I call it here recursively, that could
take linear time, right? I might touch

4006
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
take linear time, right? I might touch
 

4007
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,390
take linear time, right? I might touch
every node in my tree. So why did I do

4008
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:04,400
every node in my tree. So why did I do
 

4009
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,830
every node in my tree. So why did I do
this augmentation? It's so I don't have

4010
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840
this augmentation? It's so I don't have
 

4011
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,550
this augmentation? It's so I don't have
to do work on this node. I just return

4012
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:08,560
to do work on this node. I just return
 

4013
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,990
to do work on this node. I just return
the maximum rainfall in this subree,

4014
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,000
the maximum rainfall in this subree,
 

4015
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,189
the maximum rainfall in this subree,
right? And then recurse on this side. So

4016
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:15,199
right? And then recurse on this side. So
 

4017
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:18,310
right? And then recurse on this side. So
I I did constant work on this side. I

4018
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,320
I I did constant work on this side. I
 

4019
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,070
I I did constant work on this side. I
did one recursive call down here which

4020
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,080
did one recursive call down here which
 

4021
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,070
did one recursive call down here which
could go to the bottom. That's okay. I

4022
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:22,080
could go to the bottom. That's okay. I
 

4023
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,750
could go to the bottom. That's okay. I
can afford to go to the bottom of the

4024
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:23,760
can afford to go to the bottom of the
 

4025
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,149
can afford to go to the bottom of the
tree. Does that make sense? And if I

4026
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159
tree. Does that make sense? And if I
 

4027
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:29,430
tree. Does that make sense? And if I
don't have either subree, then I'm done.

4028
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:29,440
don't have either subree, then I'm done.
 

4029
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,310
don't have either subree, then I'm done.
Right? If if at any time I don't have

4030
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:32,320
Right? If if at any time I don't have
 

4031
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,149
Right? If if at any time I don't have
the node that I'm supposed to recurse

4032
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:34,159
the node that I'm supposed to recurse
 

4033
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:39,270
the node that I'm supposed to recurse
on, right? I take the max of this subree

4034
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:39,280
on, right? I take the max of this subree
 

4035
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,550
on, right? I take the max of this subree
myself and whatever the recursive return

4036
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:42,560
myself and whatever the recursive return
 

4037
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,790
myself and whatever the recursive return
value is here, right? and comparing

4038
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:44,800
value is here, right? and comparing
 

4039
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,270
value is here, right? and comparing
three values returning their max. Does

4040
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:47,280
three values returning their max. Does
 

4041
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,590
three values returning their max. Does
that make sense? Okay, so that's what we

4042
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:49,600
that make sense? Okay, so that's what we
 

4043
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,350
that make sense? Okay, so that's what we
call a one-sided range query. Okay, so

4044
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,360
call a one-sided range query. Okay, so
 

4045
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,870
call a one-sided range query. Okay, so
uh in the I think problem session four

4046
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
uh in the I think problem session four
 

4047
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,590
uh in the I think problem session four
that I didn't get to, it shows you uh a

4048
01:24:59,590 --> 01:24:59,600
that I didn't get to, it shows you uh a
 

4049
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,510
that I didn't get to, it shows you uh a
way to do this for a two-sided range

4050
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,520
way to do this for a two-sided range
 

4051
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,830
way to do this for a two-sided range
query where I need to know like the

4052
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840
query where I need to know like the
 

4053
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,750
query where I need to know like the
maximum of all things between two

4054
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:05,760
maximum of all things between two
 

4055
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,030
maximum of all things between two
things, right? But it's really no more

4056
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,040
things, right? But it's really no more
 

4057
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,950
things, right? But it's really no more
difficult than this defining a recursive

4058
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
difficult than this defining a recursive
 

4059
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,510
difficult than this defining a recursive
function that uses an augmentation so

4060
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:13,520
function that uses an augmentation so
 

4061
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,629
function that uses an augmentation so
that you don't have to do recursive call

4062
01:25:16,629 --> 01:25:16,639
that you don't have to do recursive call
 

4063
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:19,830
that you don't have to do recursive call
on both sides. Does that make sense?

4064
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:19,840
on both sides. Does that make sense?
 

4065
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,629
on both sides. Does that make sense?
Okay. Uh that's going to be it for now

4066
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:22,639
Okay. Uh that's going to be it for now
 

4067
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,830
Okay. Uh that's going to be it for now
and I can take questions after. Okay.

4068
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:25,840
and I can take questions after. Okay.
 

4069
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,239
and I can take questions after. Okay.
Thanks for coming.
