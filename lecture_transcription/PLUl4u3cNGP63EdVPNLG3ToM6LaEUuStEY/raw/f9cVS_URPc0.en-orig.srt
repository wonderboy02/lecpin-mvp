00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
last time we talked about weighted
 

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,429
last time we talked about weighted
graphs this is a kind of a

16
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
graphs this is a kind of a
 

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,430

generalization of what we mean by

18
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
generalization of what we mean by
 

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,150

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,590

instead of each

22
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
instead of each
 

23
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,470

the worry is that we could have negative

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
the worry is that we could have negative
 

117
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,110
the worry is that we could have negative

if a negative weight cycle is reachable

120
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
if a negative weight cycle is reachable
 

121
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,350
if a negative weight cycle is reachable
from our source then the vertices in

122
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
from our source then the vertices in
 

123
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,110
from our source then the vertices in
that cycle and anything reachable from

124
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
that cycle and anything reachable from
 

125
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,270
that cycle and anything reachable from
that cycle

126
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
that cycle
 

127
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,270
that cycle
will potentially have

128
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280

 

129
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,509

an unbounded number of edges you need to

130
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
an unbounded number of edges you need to
 

131
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,470
an unbounded number of edges you need to
go through

132
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
go through
 

133
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,110
go through
there's not a bound on the number of

there's not a bound on the number of
 

135
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,550
there's not a bound on the number of
edges for a shortest

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
edges for a shortest
 

137
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,030

around that cycle as many times as i

140
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
around that cycle as many times as i
 

141
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,270
around that cycle as many times as i
want

142
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
want
 

143
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,190
want
and get a shorter path right and so we

144
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
and get a shorter path right and so we
 

145
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,309
and get a shorter path right and so we
assign those

146
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
assign those
 

147
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,430
assign those
distances to be minus infinity okay

148
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
distances to be minus infinity okay
 

149
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,710
distances to be minus infinity okay
so that's what we're going to do today

150
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
so that's what we're going to do today
 

151

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,270
and another thing that we might want
is if there's a negative weight cycle in

everything in the graph is accessible
 

279
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,350
everything in the graph is accessible
from a negative weight cycle so this is

280
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
from a negative weight cycle so this is
 

281
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,909
from a negative weight cycle so this is
not

282
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
not

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,150
not
such an interesting problem and so we're

284
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
such an interesting problem and so we're
 

285
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,150
such an interesting problem and so we're
going to restrict our discussion today

okay so this is a little tricky

354
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
okay so this is a little tricky
 

355
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,869
okay so this is a little tricky
it's kind of related to the difference

356
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
it's kind of related to the difference

00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,189
it's kind of related to the difference

right but the connected component

372
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
right but the connected component
 

373
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,629
right but the connected component
containing s can

have at most e vertices
 

377
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,350
have at most e vertices
or order e it can actually have at most

otherwise it wouldn't be connected okay

382
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
otherwise it wouldn't be connected okay
 

383
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,990
otherwise it wouldn't be connected okay
so what we can do if we had such an

384
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
so what we can do if we had such an
 

385
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,350
so what we can do if we had such an
algorithm

386
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
algorithm
 

387
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,350
algorithm
we could first when we're given our

388
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
we could first when we're given our
 

389
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,350
we could first when we're given our
graph explore everything

390
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
graph explore everything
 

391
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,389
graph explore everything
in the graph using bfs or dfs find all

392
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
in the graph using bfs or dfs find all
 

393
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,550
in the graph using bfs or dfs find all
the things reachable from s

394
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
the things reachable from s
 

395
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,190
the things reachable from s
and then just throw away everything else

396
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
and then just throw away everything else
 

397
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,230
and then just throw away everything else
now i have a graph

398
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
now i have a graph
 

399
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,030
now i have a graph
for which v is asymptotically no bigger

400
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
for which v is asymptotically no bigger
 

401
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,550
for which v is asymptotically no bigger
than e

402
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
than e
 

403
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,870
than e
and then we can use this algorithm to

404
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
and then we can use this algorithm to
 

405
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,790
and then we can use this algorithm to
solve single source shortest paths in v

406
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
solve single source shortest paths in v
 

407
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,030
solve single source shortest paths in v

there seems to be these problems because

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
there seems to be these problems because
 

479
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,990
there seems to be these problems because
we could have minus infinities in

we could have minus infinities in

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,030
we could have minus infinities in
our deltas but if we didn't have

521
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,150
meaning it's not infinite or
minus infinite right some finite value

522
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
minus infinite right some finite value
 

523
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,310
minus infinite right some finite value
there exists

524
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320

 

525
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,829

a shortest

526
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839

 

527
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:27,990

path

528
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
path
 

529
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,430

a shortest s2v path

530
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440

 

531
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,110

that is simple

532
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
that is simple
 

533
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,110
that is simple
and remember simple means not going

534
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
and remember simple means not going
 

535
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,190
and remember simple means not going
through a vertex more than once

536
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
through a vertex more than once
 

537
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:49,190
through a vertex more than once
all right how are we going to prove this

538
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200

 

539
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,470

well consider

540
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
well consider
 

541
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,870
well consider
if this claim was not true right if

542
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
if this claim was not true right if
 

543
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,470
if this claim was not true right if
every shortest path contains a cycle

544
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
every shortest path contains a cycle
 

545
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,750
every shortest path contains a cycle
essentially right it repeated a vertex

546
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
essentially right it repeated a vertex
 

547
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,269
essentially right it repeated a vertex
then my path looks something like this

548
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
then my path looks something like this
 

549
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,710
then my path looks something like this
i mean there's some vertices along here

550
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
i mean there's some vertices along here
 

551
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,910
i mean there's some vertices along here
and then i go to v so here's s

552
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
and then i go to v so here's s
 

553
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,590
and then i go to v so here's s
and then there's this some cycle i

554
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
and then there's this some cycle i
 

555
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,590
and then there's this some cycle i
repeat some vertex i'm going to call

556
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
repeat some vertex i'm going to call
 

557
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,829
repeat some vertex i'm going to call
this cycle at

558
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
this cycle at
 

559
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,150
this cycle at
c okay

560
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
c okay
 

561
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,949
c okay
now what do i know about this path i

562
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
now what do i know about this path i
 

563
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,350
now what do i know about this path i
know that

564
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
know that
 

565
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,310
know that
it has it's a shortest path and it has

566
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
it has it's a shortest path and it has
 

567
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,509
it has it's a shortest path and it has
finite weight

568
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
finite weight
 

569
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,629
finite weight
right so in particular this path this

570
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
right so in particular this path this
 

571
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,910
right so in particular this path this
delta distance

572
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
delta distance
 

573
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,190
delta distance
is not minus infinity but

574
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
is not minus infinity but
 

575
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,110
is not minus infinity but
if this is not minus infinity what do i

576
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
if this is not minus infinity what do i
 

577
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,750
if this is not minus infinity what do i
know about the weight of this cycle

578
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760

 

579
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,150

yeah it can't be negative right because

580
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
yeah it can't be negative right because
 

581
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,670
yeah it can't be negative right because
if it was negative i could keep going

582
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
if it was negative i could keep going
 

583
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,949
if it was negative i could keep going
around this cycle

584
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
around this cycle
 

585
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,230
around this cycle
and this would have a non-finite weight

586
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
and this would have a non-finite weight
 

587
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,269
and this would have a non-finite weight
shortest path distance from s right so i

588
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
shortest path distance from s right so i
 

589
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,870
shortest path distance from s right so i
know this is

590
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
know this is
 

591
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,550
know this is
you know can't be negative so it must be

592
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
you know can't be negative so it must be
 

593
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,990
you know can't be negative so it must be
zero or positive

594
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
zero or positive
 

595
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,230
zero or positive
right but if it's zero or positive and

596
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
right but if it's zero or positive and
 

597
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,389
right but if it's zero or positive and
this is the shortest path

598
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
this is the shortest path
 

599
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,790
this is the shortest path
right went through this cycle then i

600
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
right went through this cycle then i
 

601
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,790
right went through this cycle then i
could remove it

602
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800

 

603
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,990

and now i have a new path with one

604
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
and now i have a new path with one
 

605
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,269
and now i have a new path with one
fury cycle i could just keep doing this

606
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
fury cycle i could just keep doing this
 

607
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,790
fury cycle i could just keep doing this
to create a simple path okay so

608
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
to create a simple path okay so
 

609
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,990
to create a simple path okay so
that checks out okay

610
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
that checks out okay
 

611
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,110
that checks out okay
so that's interesting if it's simple

612
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
so that's interesting if it's simple
 

613
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,590
so that's interesting if it's simple
what do we know about the number of

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
how many could there possibly be
 

621
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,110
how many could there possibly be
how long in number of edges

how long in number of edges
could a simple shortest path path be if

624
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
could a simple shortest path path be if
 

625
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,230
could a simple shortest path path be if
i can't repeat vertices

626
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
i can't repeat vertices
 

627
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,389
i can't repeat vertices
right i can have at most v vertices

628
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
right i can have at most v vertices
 

629
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,269
right i can have at most v vertices
on my simple path which means i can use

630
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
on my simple path which means i can use
 

631
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,189
on my simple path which means i can use
at most

632
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199

right
 

637
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,230
right
so simple

638
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240

 

639
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,069

paths have

645
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,310

that's a nice little thing i'd like to

646
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
that's a nice little thing i'd like to
 

647
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,670
that's a nice little thing i'd like to
to box off that's a really nice property

648
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
to box off that's a really nice property
 

649
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,230
to box off that's a really nice property
right so

650
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240

 

651
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,030

while uh a shortest path here could have

652
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
while uh a shortest path here could have
 

653
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,110
while uh a shortest path here could have
an infinite number of edges

an infinite number of edges
 

655
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,470
an infinite number of edges

right so not the the full

694
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
right so not the the full
 

695
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,389
right so not the the full
shortest path distance from s to v

696
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
shortest path distance from s to v
 

697
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,870
shortest path distance from s to v
but let's limit the number of edges i'm

698
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
but let's limit the number of edges i'm
 

699
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,069
but let's limit the number of edges i'm
allowed to go through

700
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
allowed to go through
 

701
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,189
allowed to go through
and let's talk about those shortest path

702
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
and let's talk about those shortest path
 

703
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,030
and let's talk about those shortest path
distances just among the paths

704
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
distances just among the paths
 

705
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,629

714
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
little notation here
 

715
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,189

instead of having a delta i'll have a

00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
instead of having a delta i'll have a
 

717
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,030
instead of having a delta i'll have a
delta k here that that means

718
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
delta k here that that means
 

719
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,829
delta k here that that means

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
statement right
 

761
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,909
statement right
now that doesn't mean that if it's

762
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
now that doesn't mean that if it's
 

763
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,069
now that doesn't mean that if it's
if this is uh

765
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,909

it doesn't mean the other way right if

it doesn't mean the other way right if

this is minus infinity
 

769
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,789

773
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,630

it doesn't say anything about what this

774
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
it doesn't say anything about what this
 

775
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,909
it doesn't say anything about what this
is right it just says the shortest path

776
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
is right it just says the shortest path
 

777
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,029
is right it just says the shortest path
using at most v minus one vertices using

778
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
using at most v minus one vertices using
 

779
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,270
using at most v minus one vertices using
it

780
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
it
 

781
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,470
it
at most v minus one edges uh would be

782
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
at most v minus one edges uh would be
 

783
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,830
at most v minus one edges uh would be
whatever this is

784
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
whatever this is
 

785
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,590
whatever this is
but really the shortest path length

786
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
but really the shortest path length
 

787
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,430
but really the shortest path length
needs to consider an infinite number of

788
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
needs to consider an infinite number of
 

789
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,230
needs to consider an infinite number of
edges

790
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
edges
 

791
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,590
edges
right so it doesn't really tell us much

792
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
right so it doesn't really tell us much
 

793
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,590
right so it doesn't really tell us much
about that

794
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
about that
 

795
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,830
about that
but for the finite ones it does it works

796
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
but for the finite ones it does it works
 

797
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,789
but for the finite ones it does it works
well

798
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
well
 

799
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,470
well
and so if we are able to compute this

800
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
and so if we are able to compute this
 

801
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,470
and so if we are able to compute this
thing for k equals

802
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
thing for k equals
 

803
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,669
thing for k equals
v minus 1

804
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679

 

805
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,510

in a graph that doesn't contain negative

806
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
in a graph that doesn't contain negative
 

807
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,190
in a graph that doesn't contain negative
weight cycles we'd be done

808
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
weight cycles we'd be done
 

809
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,710
weight cycles we'd be done
right

810
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720

 

811
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,830

i claim to you a stronger statement that

812
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840

 

813
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,070

if

814
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080

 

815
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,150

the shortest path using

816
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160

 

817
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,630

at most v edges from s to v

818
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
at most v edges from s to v
 

819
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,390
at most v edges from s to v
is less than strictly less than delta of

820
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
is less than strictly less than delta of
 

821
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,270
is less than strictly less than delta of
v minus one

822
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280

 

823
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,710

right this is all in the subscript here

824
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
right this is all in the subscript here
 

825
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,950
right this is all in the subscript here
right basically this is the sh

826
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:40,960
right basically this is the sh
 

827
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,310
right basically this is the sh

definitely it includes all this the

definitely it includes all this the

if there's a shorter path to my vertex

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,070
if there's a shorter path to my vertex
that goes through more than v minus 1

that this path can't be simple right

846
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
that this path can't be simple right
 

847
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,150
that this path can't be simple right
because it goes through a vertex more

848
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
because it goes through a vertex more
 

849
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,909
because it goes through a vertex more
than once otherwise it would be included

850
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
than once otherwise it would be included
 

851
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,830

in this
 

853
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,390
in this
distance set right so if this is the

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400

855
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,750

856
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760

that uses v edges but yeah that uses v

that path can't be simple which means

864
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
that path can't be simple which means
 

865
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,350
that path can't be simple which means

okay so if this is true

872
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
okay so if this is true
 

873
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,029
okay so if this is true
then i know

874
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
then i know
 

875
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,549
then i know
that the real shortest path distance

876
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
that the real shortest path distance

right i'm going to call such a vertex a
 

883
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,630
right i'm going to call such a vertex a

885
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,430

you how to compute these things yet

890
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,120
you how to compute these things yet
 

891
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,789
you how to compute these things yet
right but if i were able to find a

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,230

okay so

914
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240

 

915
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,549

if this property is true it's a witness

916
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
if this property is true it's a witness
 

917
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,909
if this property is true it's a witness
and it definitely has this

918
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
and it definitely has this
 

919
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,630
and it definitely has this
is it possible you think i'm going to

920
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
is it possible you think i'm going to
 

921
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,789
is it possible you think i'm going to
claim to you that it's possible

922
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
claim to you that it's possible
 

923
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,110
claim to you that it's possible
that a vertex could have minus infinite

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
that a vertex could have minus infinite

926
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200

927
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,870
distance
but not have this property hold okay

928
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
but not have this property hold okay
 

929
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,270
but not have this property hold okay
there's i could probably give you an

930
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
there's i could probably give you an
 

931
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,789
there's i could probably give you an
example i don't have one off the top of

932
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
example i don't have one off the top of
 

933
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,070
example i don't have one off the top of
my head right now

934
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
my head right now
 

935
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,350
my head right now
but that's possible you could imagine

936
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
but that's possible you could imagine
 

937
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,950
but that's possible you could imagine
there might be no path going to a vertex

938
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
there might be no path going to a vertex
 

939
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,270
there might be no path going to a vertex
on a negative weight cycle

940
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
on a negative weight cycle
 

941
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,909
on a negative weight cycle
that goes through v exactly the edges

942
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
that goes through v exactly the edges
 

943
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,390
that goes through v exactly the edges
right

944
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
right
 

945
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,190
right
it might go through more edges a shorter

946
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
it might go through more edges a shorter
 

947
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,990
it might go through more edges a shorter
one

948
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
one
 

949
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,750
one
right so this equation would be an

950
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
right so this equation would be an
 

951
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,710
right so this equation would be an
equality

952
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
equality
 

953
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,830
equality
and would not certify that this is true

954
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
and would not certify that this is true
 

955
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,110
and would not certify that this is true
right but i claim to you

956
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
right but i claim to you
 

957
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,350
right but i claim to you
if a vertex has this property if it's

958
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
if a vertex has this property if it's
 

959
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,350
if a vertex has this property if it's
its shortest path distance is minus

960
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
its shortest path distance is minus
 

961
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,870
its shortest path distance is minus
infinite

962
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
infinite
 

963
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,029
infinite
then it must be reachable from a witness

964
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
then it must be reachable from a witness
 

965
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,950
then it must be reachable from a witness
okay so that's the claim

966
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960

 

967
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,110

if delta sv

968
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
if delta sv
 

969
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,470
if delta sv
is minus infinity

970
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480

 

971
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,750

then v is

972
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
then v is
 

973
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,029
then v is
reachable

974
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039

 

975
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,470

from a witness

976
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480

 

977
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,470

reachable from a vertex that has this

978
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
reachable from a vertex that has this
 

979
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,990
reachable from a vertex that has this
property that has

980
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
property that has
 

981
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,549
property that has
this property and if it's reachable from

982
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
this property and if it's reachable from
 

983
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,310
this property and if it's reachable from
something that has

984
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
something that has
 

985
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,029
something that has
minus infinity shortest path weight then

986
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
minus infinity shortest path weight then
 

987
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,549
minus infinity shortest path weight then
i can take that path

988
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
i can take that path
 

989
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,430
i can take that path
go to my reachable vertex and that's

990
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,440
go to my reachable vertex and that's
 

991
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,149
go to my reachable vertex and that's
also a

992
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
also a
 

993
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,270
also a
minus infinite path right okay so how do

994
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
minus infinite path right okay so how do
 

995
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:28,070
minus infinite path right okay so how do
we prove this

996
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080

 

997
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:36,310

well let's consider

998
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,320

 

999
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,390

let's let's i'm going to state a

1000
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
let's let's i'm going to state a
 

1001
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,270
let's let's i'm going to state a
somewhat stronger statement

1002
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
somewhat stronger statement
 

1003
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,909
somewhat stronger statement
uh that will prove instead okay it

1004
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
uh that will prove instead okay it
 

1005
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,590
uh that will prove instead okay it
suffices to prove

1006
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600

1007
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,590

1011
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,350

that
 

1013
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,230
that
right then every vertex with this

00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
right then every vertex with this
 

1015
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,909
right then every vertex with this

then every vertex reachable from

1044
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
then every vertex reachable from
 

1045
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,950
then every vertex reachable from
one of those witnesses in particular

1046
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
one of those witnesses in particular
 

1047
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,750
one of those witnesses in particular
reachable from the negative weight cycle

1048
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760

 

1049
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,029

has is uh

1050
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
has is uh
 

1051
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,029
has is uh
has shortest path distance minus

1052
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
has shortest path distance minus
 

1053
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,190
has shortest path distance minus
infinity and that should prove the claim

1054
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
infinity and that should prove the claim
 

1055
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,190
infinity and that should prove the claim
right uh is this thing has to be

1056
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
right uh is this thing has to be
 

1057
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,710
right uh is this thing has to be
reachable from a negative weight cycle

1058
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720

 

1059
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,230

uh and so if we prove negative weight

1060
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
uh and so if we prove negative weight
 

1061
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,830
uh and so if we prove negative weight
cycles contain witnesses

1062
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:16,840
cycles contain witnesses
 

1063
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,669
cycles contain witnesses
then all of these vertices are reachable

1064
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
then all of these vertices are reachable
 

1065
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,269
then all of these vertices are reachable
from a witness okay great

1066
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
from a witness okay great
 

1067
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,590
from a witness okay great
great confusing myself there for a

1068
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
great confusing myself there for a
 

1069
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,430
great confusing myself there for a
second okay

1070
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
second okay
 

1071
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,990
second okay
so let's consider a negative weight

1072
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
so let's consider a negative weight
 

1073
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,789
so let's consider a negative weight
cycle

1074
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799

 

1075
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,669

in g okay this is a directed negative

1076
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
in g okay this is a directed negative
 

1077
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,430
in g okay this is a directed negative
weight cycle

1078
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
weight cycle
 

1079
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,510
weight cycle
recall okay this would be my

1080
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
recall okay this would be my
 

1081
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,710
recall okay this would be my
negative weight cycle c right

1082
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
negative weight cycle c right
 

1083
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,510
negative weight cycle c right
all the sum of the edges in this thing

1084
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
all the sum of the edges in this thing
 

1085
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,149
all the sum of the edges in this thing
the way

1086
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
the way
 

1087
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,789
the way
the weights has negative weight

1088
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799

 

1089
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,990

and i'm going to have a little bit

1090
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
and i'm going to have a little bit
 

1091
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,909
and i'm going to have a little bit
notation if i have a

1092
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
notation if i have a
 

1093
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,029
notation if i have a
vertex v here i'm going to say

1094
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
vertex v here i'm going to say
 

1095
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,070
vertex v here i'm going to say
that its predecessor in the cycle i'm

1096
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
that its predecessor in the cycle i'm
 

1097
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,950
that its predecessor in the cycle i'm
just going to call it v

1098
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
just going to call it v
 

1099
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,789
just going to call it v
prime okay that's just some notation

1100
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799

 

1101
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,149

all right so

1102
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
all right so
 

1103
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,310
all right so
if i have computed these

1104
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,320
if i have computed these
 

1105
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,630
if i have computed these

then i know the following thing holds

1118
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
then i know the following thing holds
 

1119
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,630
then i know the following thing holds
delta

00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
v prime its predecessor plus the weight
 

1133
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,990
v prime its predecessor plus the weight
going from the predecessor to my vertex

1134
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,000
going from the predecessor to my vertex
 

1135
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,430
going from the predecessor to my vertex
why is that why is that because

1136
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,440
why is that why is that because
 

1137
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,149
why is that why is that because
this is the weight of some vertex this

1138
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:02,159
this is the weight of some vertex this
 

1139
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,110
this is the weight of some vertex this
is

1140
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
is
 

1141
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,789
is
the way the shortest path distance to

1142
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
the way the shortest path distance to
 

1143
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,149
the way the shortest path distance to
my predecessor using one fewer edge

1144
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
my predecessor using one fewer edge
 

1145
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,710
my predecessor using one fewer edge
and so this in particular is the weight

1146
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
and so this in particular is the weight
 

1147
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,710
and so this in particular is the weight
of some path

1148
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
of some path
 

1149
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,149
of some path
that uses v edges so if this is the

1150
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
that uses v edges so if this is the
 

1151
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:18,950
that uses v edges so if this is the
shortest such

1152
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
shortest such
 

1153
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,950
shortest such
path distance this has to upper bound it

1154
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960
path distance this has to upper bound it
 

1155
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,110
path distance this has to upper bound it
right at least at most yeah

1156
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
right at least at most yeah
 

1157
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,870
right at least at most yeah
that's that is a statement of the

1158
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
that's that is a statement of the
 

1159
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,149
that's that is a statement of the
triangle inequality thank you

1160
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159

 

1161
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,510

all right so yes

1162
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,520
all right so yes
 

1163
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,630
all right so yes
this is just by triangle inequality okay

1164
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
this is just by triangle inequality okay
 

1165
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,070
this is just by triangle inequality okay
now what we can say is let's take

1166
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
now what we can say is let's take
 

1167
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,230
now what we can say is let's take
this equation summed over all vertices

of this whole thing okay i'm going to
 

1179
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,350
of this whole thing okay i'm going to
do that out a little bit neater okay

1180
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
do that out a little bit neater okay

in c right these are the sum of the
weights in my cycle

1214
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
weights in my cycle
 

1215
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,710
weights in my cycle
well what do i know about this cycle

1216
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:56,720
well what do i know about this cycle
 

1217
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,350
well what do i know about this cycle
right this is just the weight of c right

1218
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
right this is just the weight of c right
 

1219
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,590
right this is just the weight of c right
weight of c

1220
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:01,600
weight of c
 

1221
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,190
weight of c
that's awful handwriting c

1222
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,200
that's awful handwriting c
 

1223
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,389
that's awful handwriting c
what do i know about the weight of the

1224
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
what do i know about the weight of the
 

1225
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,190
what do i know about the weight of the
cycle it's negative right

1226
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
cycle it's negative right
 

1227
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,549
cycle it's negative right
so this is less than zero

1228
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
so this is less than zero
 

1229
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,470
so this is less than zero
which means that if i remove this

1230
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
which means that if i remove this
 

1231
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,830
which means that if i remove this
this needs to be a strict equality

1232
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
this needs to be a strict equality
 

1233
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,310
this needs to be a strict equality
right but if this

1234
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,320
right but if this
 

1235
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,149
right but if this
if the sum of all of these is less

1236
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
if the sum of all of these is less

so the claim holds if

1262
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
so the claim holds if
 

1263
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,789
so the claim holds if
we have a negative infinite shortest

then v is reachable from a witness so it

1268
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
then v is reachable from a witness so it
 

1269
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,590
then v is reachable from a witness so it
suffices for us to find all the

does that make sense okay

1280
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
does that make sense okay
 

1281
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,430
does that make sense okay
so now we finally are able to get to

00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
so now we finally are able to get to

is a little different than what is

is a little different than what is
 

1289
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,870
is a little different than what is
normally presented as bellman ford

the original bellman ford algorithm
 

1293
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,389
the original bellman ford algorithm
does something a little different and

1294
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:44,399
does something a little different and
 

1295
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,510
does something a little different and
because it does something a little

1296
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
because it does something a little
 

1297
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,710
because it does something a little
different which we'll talk about at the

1298
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720
different which we'll talk about at the
 

1299
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,070
different which we'll talk about at the
end

1300
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
end
 

1301
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,149

gonna

1304

1308
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
easier to analyze
 

1309
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,549
easier to analyze
and has this nice property that we're

1310
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
and has this nice property that we're
 

1311
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,029
and has this nice property that we're
going to be able to use the algorithm

1312
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
going to be able to use the algorithm
 

1313
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,750
going to be able to use the algorithm
to give us a negative weight cycle if it

1314
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
to give us a negative weight cycle if it
 

1315
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,830
to give us a negative weight cycle if it
exists

1316

exists
 

1317
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,269
exists
okay so we're gonna say this is a

1318
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
okay so we're gonna say this is a
 

1319
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,230
okay so we're gonna say this is a
maybe a modified bellman ford and the

1320
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
maybe a modified bellman ford and the
 

1321
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,430
maybe a modified bellman ford and the
idea here is to

1322
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440

 

1323
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,710

make a vertex associated make many

make a vertex associated make many
 

1325
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,990
make a vertex associated make many
versions of a vertex okay and i want

00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
versions of a vertex okay and i want

versions of a vertex okay and i want
this version of the vertex

1328
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159
this version of the vertex

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,750
to correspond to whether i came here
using

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
using
 

1333
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,269
using
zero edges one edge two edges

zero edges one edge two edges
 

1335
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,110
zero edges one edge two edges
three edges i have a different vertex

1336
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
three edges i have a different vertex
 

1337

at most a certain number of edges okay
 

1345
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,830
at most a certain number of edges okay
so this is an idea called graph

1346
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:48,840
so this is an idea called graph
 

1347
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,029
so this is an idea called graph

1352
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
duplication and this is a very common
 

1353
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:00,789

for solving graph related problems
because essentially what i get to do is

1358
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:06,640
because essentially what i get to do is
 

1359
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,350
because essentially what i get to do is
i get to store information right it's

00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
i get to store information right it's

i'm i'm if i'm having different versions
of a vertex

1366
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
of a vertex
 

1367
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,310
of a vertex
i can have that vertex correspond to

1368
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,320
i can have that vertex correspond to
 

1369
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,750
i can have that vertex correspond to
reaching that vertex

1370
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
reaching that vertex
 

1371
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,630
reaching that vertex
in a different state okay so that's what

1372
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
in a different state okay so that's what
 

1373
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,990
in a different state okay so that's what
we're going to do here

1374
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
we're going to do here
 

1375
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,830
we're going to do here
the idea here is make

1376
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:30,840

 

1377
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,909

1378
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
the plus one
 

1379
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,190
the plus one
levels basically

1380
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
levels basically
 

1381
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,990

duplicate vertices in our graph

1382
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000

k edges okay so this definition

1396
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:15,519
k edges okay so this definition
 

1397
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,029
k edges okay so this definition
seems similar to what we're doing up

1398
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
seems similar to what we're doing up
 

1399
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,750
seems similar to what we're doing up
here right

1400
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:19,760

 

1401
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,230

if if we have vertices that have this

1402
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,240
if if we have vertices that have this
 

1403
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,590
if if we have vertices that have this

1404
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600

1405
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,830

then their shortest paths in this new

1406
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
then their shortest paths in this new
 

1407
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,630
then their shortest paths in this new

1413
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,830

and really what the name of the game

1414
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:31,840
and really what the name of the game
 

1415
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,909
and really what the name of the game
here is to compute these two for every

00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:33,919
here is to compute these two for every
 

1417
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,950
here is to compute these two for every

1418
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:34,960
vertex
 

1419
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,230

because then we can con then if

1420
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
because then we can con then if
 

1421
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,149
because then we can con then if
uh d is finite delta is finite

1422
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
uh d is finite delta is finite
 

1423
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,070
uh d is finite delta is finite
then this guy will be the length of our

1424
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,080
then this guy will be the length of our
 

1425
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,029
then this guy will be the length of our
shortest path and if they're different

1426
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039
shortest path and if they're different
 

1427
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,950
shortest path and if they're different
that'll be a witness and we can explore

1428
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:48,960
that'll be a witness and we can explore
 

1429
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,750
that'll be a witness and we can explore
from it okay

1430
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
from it okay
 

1431
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,789
from it okay
so

1432
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799

 

1433
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,710

and if we

1434
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
and if we
 

1435
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,389
and if we
connect

1436
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:02,399

 

1437
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,110

edges

1438
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,120

 

1439
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,070

uh from

1440
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080

 

1441
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,750

one level to

1442
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,760
one level to
 

1443
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,310
one level to
only higher levels

1444
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,320

 

1445
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,990

basically levels with a higher k

1446
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
basically levels with a higher k
 

1447
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,310
basically levels with a higher k
then this graph is going to be a dag

1448
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,320

 

1449
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,350

oh that's cool

1450
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
oh that's cool
 

1451
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,470
oh that's cool
why is that cool because we saw how to

1452
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480
why is that cool because we saw how to
 

1453
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,630
why is that cool because we saw how to
solve single source shortest paths in a

1454
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
solve single source shortest paths in a
 

1455
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,990
solve single source shortest paths in a
dag in linear time

1456
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
dag in linear time
 

1457
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,190
dag in linear time
now this graph that we're going to

1458
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,200
now this graph that we're going to
 

1459
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,190
now this graph that we're going to
construct is going to have v

1460
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
construct is going to have v
 

1461
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,750
construct is going to have v
plus 1 levels so could have

1462
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,760
plus 1 levels so could have
 

1463
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,950
plus 1 levels so could have
our our graph kind of explodes v

1464
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
our our graph kind of explodes v
 

1465
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,630
our our graph kind of explodes v
times right we're going to do that in a

1466
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,640
times right we're going to do that in a
 

1467
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,669
times right we're going to do that in a
second i'm going to

1468
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
second i'm going to
 

1469
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,310
second i'm going to
be more precise with what i mean there

1470
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
be more precise with what i mean there
 

1471
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,870
be more precise with what i mean there
but

1472
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,880
but
 

1473
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,149
but
if we're multiplying our graph v v plus

1474
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
if we're multiplying our graph v v plus
 

1475
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,590
if we're multiplying our graph v v plus
1 times

1476
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:07,600
1 times
 

1477
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,589
1 times
then the size of our graph is now v

1478
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:09,599
then the size of our graph is now v
 

1479
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,589
then the size of our graph is now v
times larger that doesn't

1480
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:11,599
times larger that doesn't
 

1481
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,629
times larger that doesn't
that's not so hard to believe

1482
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
that's not so hard to believe
 

1483
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,829
that's not so hard to believe
but if we made our graph v times larger

1484
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
but if we made our graph v times larger
 

1485
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,550
but if we made our graph v times larger
and we ran a shortest path algorithm in

1486
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:20,560
and we ran a shortest path algorithm in
 

1487
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,990
and we ran a shortest path algorithm in
linear time with respect to that graph

1488
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,000
linear time with respect to that graph
 

1489
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,909
linear time with respect to that graph
then that graph has something like size

1490
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:27,919
then that graph has something like size
 

1491
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,510
then that graph has something like size
v times v plus

1492
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520
v times v plus
 

1493
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,669
v times v plus
e size

1494
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679

 

1495
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,710

that looks familiar maybe

1496
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720

 

1497
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,589

that's this running time right so if we

1498
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
that's this running time right so if we
 

1499
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,109
that's this running time right so if we
can find an algorithm that runs in that

1500
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:47,119
can find an algorithm that runs in that
 

1501
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,069
can find an algorithm that runs in that
running time

1502
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:48,079
running time
 

1503
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,950
running time
we can get down to v times e okay so

1504
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:50,960
we can get down to v times e okay so
 

1505
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,510
we can get down to v times e okay so
let's try to do that

1506
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520

 

1507
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,349

here's the transformation i'm going to

1508
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
here's the transformation i'm going to
 

1509
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,390
here's the transformation i'm going to
show you i'm going to show you first

1510
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,400
show you i'm going to show you first
 

1511
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,990
show you i'm going to show you first
with an example

1512
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
with an example
 

1513
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,390
with an example
okay here's an example of a directed

1514
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
okay here's an example of a directed
 

1515
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,030
okay here's an example of a directed
graph that does contain a negative

1516
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
graph that does contain a negative
 

1517
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,150
graph that does contain a negative
weight cycle

1518
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,160
weight cycle
 

1519
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,790
weight cycle
okay can anyone find it for me

1520
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
okay can anyone find it for me
 

1521
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,550
okay can anyone find it for me
b c d right has weight minus four

1522
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,560
b c d right has weight minus four
 

1523
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,950
b c d right has weight minus four
plus three minus one it has a minus two

1524
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:24,960
plus three minus one it has a minus two
 

1525
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,190
plus three minus one it has a minus two
total weight right so that's a negative

1526
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
total weight right so that's a negative
 

1527
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,230
total weight right so that's a negative
weight cycle

1528
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
weight cycle
 

1529
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,870
weight cycle
okay so if i were to take shortest paths

1530
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
okay so if i were to take shortest paths
 

1531
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,349
okay so if i were to take shortest paths
from

1532
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:31,359
from
 

1533
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,589
from
a right i will want to say

1534
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:35,599
a right i will want to say
 

1535
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,670
a right i will want to say
at the end of my algorithm this better

1536
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:37,680
at the end of my algorithm this better
 

1537
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,190
at the end of my algorithm this better
be zero

1538
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,200
be zero
 

1539
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,190
be zero
and all of these better be minus

1540
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,200
and all of these better be minus
 

1541
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,710
and all of these better be minus
infinity right

1542
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:42,720
infinity right
 

1543
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,190
infinity right
so that's what i want in my in my

1544
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
so that's what i want in my in my
 

1545
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,030
so that's what i want in my in my
algorithm

1546
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
algorithm
 

1547
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,710
algorithm
so what's my algorithm going to be i'm

1548
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
so what's my algorithm going to be i'm
 

1549
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,390
so what's my algorithm going to be i'm
going to make

1550
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,400
going to make
 

1551
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,030
going to make
v plus one copies of this graph

1552
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
v plus one copies of this graph
 

1553
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,470
v plus one copies of this graph
and i'm going to kind of stretch it out

1554
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,480
and i'm going to kind of stretch it out
 

1555
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,230
and i'm going to kind of stretch it out
right okay so here

1556
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,240
right okay so here
 

1557
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,510
right okay so here
i have v zero one two

1558
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:01,520
i have v zero one two
 

1559
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,430
i have v zero one two
three four there are four vertices in my

1560
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,440
three four there are four vertices in my
 

1561
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,069
three four there are four vertices in my
graph so this is one two three four

1562
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
graph so this is one two three four
 

1563
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,670
graph so this is one two three four
five copies of my graph i have a

1564
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:09,680
five copies of my graph i have a
 

1565
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,790
five copies of my graph i have a
version of vertex a for each one of

1566
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
version of vertex a for each one of
 

1567
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,030
version of vertex a for each one of
those copies a version of vertex b for

1568
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,040
those copies a version of vertex b for
 

1569
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,310
those copies a version of vertex b for
each of those copies c

1570
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,320
each of those copies c
 

1571
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,349
each of those copies c
and d etc okay so i have this nice grid

1572
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
and d etc okay so i have this nice grid
 

1573
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,589
and d etc okay so i have this nice grid
of vertices

1574
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
of vertices
 

1575
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,230
of vertices
and i'm not going to put any edges

1576
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,240
and i'm not going to put any edges
 

1577
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,750
and i'm not going to put any edges
within a layer

1578
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:25,760
within a layer
 

1579
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,630
within a layer
within a level right because then i mean

1580
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
within a level right because then i mean
 

1581
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,550
within a level right because then i mean
this graph has cycles right

1582
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:30,560
this graph has cycles right
 

1583
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,390
this graph has cycles right
and i don't want cycles in my graph

1584
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,400
and i don't want cycles in my graph
 

1585
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,150
and i don't want cycles in my graph
right what i'm going to do instead

1586
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,160
right what i'm going to do instead
 

1587
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,430
right what i'm going to do instead
is for every edge in my original graph

1588
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
is for every edge in my original graph
 

1589
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,390
is for every edge in my original graph
for example the edge from a to b i'm

1590
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,400
for example the edge from a to b i'm
 

1591
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,829
for example the edge from a to b i'm
going to connect it to the

1592
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:41,839
going to connect it to the
 

1593
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,670
going to connect it to the
the b in the next level right so a0

1594
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
the b in the next level right so a0
 

1595
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,790
the b in the next level right so a0
is connected to b1 with an edge weight

1596
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:48,800
is connected to b1 with an edge weight
 

1597
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,750
is connected to b1 with an edge weight
of -5

1598
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:49,760
of -5
 

1599
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,990
of -5
just like in the original okay and i'm

1600
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,000
just like in the original okay and i'm
 

1601
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,270
just like in the original okay and i'm
going to do that for every edge in my

1602
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,280
going to do that for every edge in my
 

1603
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,670
going to do that for every edge in my
graph

1604
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:53,680
graph
 

1605
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,030
graph
and i'm going to repeat that down all

1606
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
and i'm going to repeat that down all
 

1607
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,069
and i'm going to repeat that down all
the way okay

1608
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
the way okay
 

1609
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,109
the way okay
in addition i'm going to add

1610
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
in addition i'm going to add
 

1611
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,870
in addition i'm going to add
a zero weight edge from a0 to a1

1612
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:04,880
a zero weight edge from a0 to a1
 

1613
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,589
a zero weight edge from a0 to a1
or from every vertex all the way down

1614
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
or from every vertex all the way down
 

1615
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,950
or from every vertex all the way down
the line these are all

1616
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:08,960
the line these are all
 

1617
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,589
the line these are all
zero weight edges corresponding to i'm

1618
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
zero weight edges corresponding to i'm
 

1619
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,589
zero weight edges corresponding to i'm
not going to traverse an edge

1620
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:13,599
not going to traverse an edge
 

1621
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,150
not going to traverse an edge
i'm just going to stay at this vertex

1622
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,160
i'm just going to stay at this vertex
 

1623
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,190
i'm just going to stay at this vertex
okay

1624
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,200
okay
 

1625
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,950
okay
that's going to allow us to simulate

1626
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:18,960
that's going to allow us to simulate
 

1627
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,230
that's going to allow us to simulate
this at most

1628
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
this at most
 

1629
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,910
this at most
k edges condition now if you take a look

1630
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,920
k edges condition now if you take a look
 

1631
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,950
k edges condition now if you take a look
at paths in this graph from a0

1632
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:26,960
at paths in this graph from a0
 

1633
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,510
at paths in this graph from a0
our starting vertex

1634
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520

 

1635
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,910

clearly none of the other vertices are

1636
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:33,920
clearly none of the other vertices are
 

1637
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,270
clearly none of the other vertices are
in that level

1638
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
in that level
 

1639
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,630
in that level
are reachable from a zero right

1640
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
are reachable from a zero right
 

1641
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,030
are reachable from a zero right
just as we want right because the

1642
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040
just as we want right because the
 

1643
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,109
just as we want right because the
shortest path distance

1644
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
shortest path distance
 

1645
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,109
shortest path distance
to any of these vertices using at most

1646
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119
to any of these vertices using at most
 

1647
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,950
to any of these vertices using at most
zero edges

1648
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:46,960
zero edges
 

1649
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,870
zero edges
should be infinite right i can't get

1650
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:48,880
should be infinite right i can't get
 

1651
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,710
should be infinite right i can't get
there in zero edges

1652
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:50,720
there in zero edges
 

1653
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,670
there in zero edges
okay but then any path in this graph

1654
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:55,680
okay but then any path in this graph
 

1655
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,829
okay but then any path in this graph
using

1656
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
using
 

1657
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,910
using
at most

1658
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:01,920

 

1659
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,829

k edges is going to correspond

1660
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:05,839
k edges is going to correspond
 

1661
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,430
k edges is going to correspond
to a path from 0 a0

1662
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
to a path from 0 a0
 

1663
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,829
to a path from 0 a0
to a vertex in that level the

1664
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:11,839
to a vertex in that level the
 

1665
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,630
to a vertex in that level the
corresponding level so for example

1666
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
corresponding level so for example
 

1667
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,790
corresponding level so for example
if i had a if i was looking for paths

1668
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:18,800
if i had a if i was looking for paths
 

1669
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,990
if i had a if i was looking for paths
to be right

1670
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000

 

1671
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,829

using at most three edges

1672
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:30,839

 

1673
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,310

right

1674
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
right
 

1675
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,109
right
any pat a path from a0 to

1676
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
any pat a path from a0 to
 

1677
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,550
any pat a path from a0 to
b3 in this graph

1678
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,560
b3 in this graph
 

1679
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,510
b3 in this graph
would correspond to a path in this graph

1680
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:43,520
would correspond to a path in this graph
 

1681
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,990
would correspond to a path in this graph
that uses it most

1682
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,000
that uses it most
 

1683
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,390
that uses it most
three edges right so let's find such a

1684
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,400
three edges right so let's find such a
 

1685
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,190
three edges right so let's find such a
path

1686
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,200
path
 

1687
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,510
path
okay so going from a0

1688
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,520
okay so going from a0
 

1689
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,150
okay so going from a0
b1 stay at b1

1690
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
b1 stay at b1
 

1691
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,030
b1 stay at b1
stay at b sorry yeah that's a that's a

1692
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040
stay at b sorry yeah that's a that's a
 

1693
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,510
stay at b sorry yeah that's a that's a
path using fewer than

1694
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
path using fewer than
 

1695
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,870
path using fewer than
three edges or at most three edges okay

1696
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:06,880
three edges or at most three edges okay
 

1697
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,589
three edges or at most three edges okay
but there's another path here where is

1698
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:09,599
but there's another path here where is
 

1699
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,950
but there's another path here where is
it

1700
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:10,960
it
 

1701
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,870
it
going from a a a to b okay that's not

1702
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
going from a a a to b okay that's not
 

1703
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,230
going from a a a to b okay that's not
such an interesting one that's the same

1704
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,240
such an interesting one that's the same
 

1705
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,190
such an interesting one that's the same
path

1706
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,200
path
 

1707
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,109
path
so i might have more than one path in

1708
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119
so i might have more than one path in
 

1709
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,430
so i might have more than one path in
here corresponding to a path in there

1710
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
here corresponding to a path in there
 

1711
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,310
here corresponding to a path in there
but my claim is that any path in here

1712
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,320
but my claim is that any path in here
 

1713
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,829
but my claim is that any path in here
corresponds to a path in here

1714
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:26,839
corresponds to a path in here
 

1715
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,390
corresponds to a path in here
okay so what's a what's a

1716
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,400
okay so what's a what's a
 

1717
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,950
okay so what's a what's a
path of length three that's non-trivial

1718
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:32,960
path of length three that's non-trivial
 

1719
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,589
path of length three that's non-trivial
yeah a

1720
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:33,599
yeah a
 

1721
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,790
yeah a
to c to d to b okay so

1722
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:36,800
to c to d to b okay so
 

1723
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,069
to c to d to b okay so
a to c

1724
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:40,079
a to c
 

1725
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,910
a to c
to d to b yeah that's a path

1726
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
to d to b yeah that's a path
 

1727
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,150
to d to b yeah that's a path
right and i basically because i

1728
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,160
right and i basically because i
 

1729
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,829
right and i basically because i
constructed this so that the edges

1730
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
constructed this so that the edges
 

1731
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,589
constructed this so that the edges
always move from level to level

1732
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:49,599
always move from level to level
 

1733
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,550
always move from level to level
as i traverse these edges i always

1734
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
as i traverse these edges i always
 

1735
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,829
as i traverse these edges i always
change levels

1736
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:54,839
change levels
 

1737
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,150
change levels
yeah but my original graph doesn't have

1738
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,160
yeah but my original graph doesn't have
 

1739
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,790
yeah but my original graph doesn't have
these self loops yes my original graph

1740
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:02,800
these self loops yes my original graph
 

1741
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,550
these self loops yes my original graph
doesn't have an edge from a to a

1742
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,560
doesn't have an edge from a to a
 

1743
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,230
doesn't have an edge from a to a
that's true right i'm using these edges

1744
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
that's true right i'm using these edges
 

1745
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,309
that's true right i'm using these edges
to correspond to

1746
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:12,319
to correspond to
 

1747
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:19,030
to correspond to
i'm deciding not to take an edge right

1748
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,040

 

1749
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,910

it's not that i'm like doing any work

1750
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
it's not that i'm like doing any work
 

1751
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,470
it's not that i'm like doing any work
here i'm just staying there for a state

1752
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:24,480
here i'm just staying there for a state
 

1753
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,309
here i'm just staying there for a state
okay and that's what's going to allow me

1754
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:26,319
okay and that's what's going to allow me
 

1755
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,069
okay and that's what's going to allow me
to get this at most

1756
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
to get this at most
 

1757
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,470
to get this at most
edges all right so this is the graph we

1758
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:30,480
edges all right so this is the graph we
 

1759
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,589
edges all right so this is the graph we
construct hopefully

1760
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
construct hopefully
 

1761
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,270
construct hopefully
you understand that we made these

1762
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,280
you understand that we made these
 

1763
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,430
you understand that we made these
v layers right this is

1764
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,440
v layers right this is
 

1765
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,349
v layers right this is
v right and

1766
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:43,359
v right and
 

1767
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,390
v right and
a vertex we made v copies of every

1768
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,400
a vertex we made v copies of every
 

1769
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,109
a vertex we made v copies of every
vertex

1770
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
vertex
 

1771
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,950
vertex
and connected them using edges in this

1772
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
and connected them using edges in this
 

1773
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,950
and connected them using edges in this
way okay

1774
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
way okay
 

1775
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,030
way okay
so first step of bellman ford is

1776
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
so first step of bellman ford is
 

1777
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,430
so first step of bellman ford is
construct this graph

1778
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:57,440

 

1779
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,950

uh so bellman ford construct

1780
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960

 

1781
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,670

construct g prime

1782
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
construct g prime
 

1783
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,230
construct g prime
as described above it has

1784
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,240

 

1785
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,870

how many vertices

1786
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880

 

1787
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,990

v times v plus one right

1788
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,000
v times v plus one right
 

1789
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,270
v times v plus one right
v times v plus 1 vertices and how many

1790
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
v times v plus 1 vertices and how many
 

1791
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,309
v times v plus 1 vertices and how many
edges

1792
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319
edges
 

1793
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,150
edges
well i have one edge for outgoing edge

1794
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160
well i have one edge for outgoing edge
 

1795
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,910
well i have one edge for outgoing edge
for each vertex corresponding to

1796
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
for each vertex corresponding to
 

1797
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,230
for each vertex corresponding to
just staying in the same place right so

1798
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
just staying in the same place right so
 

1799
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,829
just staying in the same place right so
that's

1800
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:35,839
that's
 

1801
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,270
that's
v squared vertices i mean edges

1802
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
v squared vertices i mean edges
 

1803
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,390
v squared vertices i mean edges
and then i have one edge

1804
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
and then i have one edge
 

1805
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,589
and then i have one edge
for every edge in my graph i have k

1806
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
for every edge in my graph i have k
 

1807
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,630
for every edge in my graph i have k
sorry i have a v minus one

1808
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
sorry i have a v minus one
 

1809
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,750
sorry i have a v minus one
sorry just v i have v edges for every

1810
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
sorry just v i have v edges for every
 

1811
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,710
sorry just v i have v edges for every
edge in my graph

1812
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
edge in my graph
 

1813
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,430
edge in my graph
okay so that means so this is the number

1814
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
okay so that means so this is the number
 

1815
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,230
okay so that means so this is the number
of vertices

1816
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240

 

1817
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,150

and v times v

1818
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,160

 

1819
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,190

plus v times e

1820
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200

 

1821
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,630

this is v v

1822
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:14,640
this is v v
 

1823
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,470
this is v v
plus e all right cool

1824
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
plus e all right cool
 

1825
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,910
plus e all right cool
so that's how many edges i have

1826
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:21,920

 

1827
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,670

so we construct it in that way it's a

1828
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,680
so we construct it in that way it's a
 

1829
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,750
so we construct it in that way it's a
dag right if we only have

1830
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:25,760
dag right if we only have
 

1831
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,190
dag right if we only have
edges going to increasing levels

1832
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
edges going to increasing levels
 

1833
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,670
edges going to increasing levels
then this thing can have cycles because

1834
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
then this thing can have cycles because
 

1835
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,870
then this thing can have cycles because
otherwise that would mean there would be

1836
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
otherwise that would mean there would be
 

1837
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,230
otherwise that would mean there would be
an edge pointing backwards

1838
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,240
an edge pointing backwards
 

1839
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,510
an edge pointing backwards
right and we didn't construct any of

1840
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
right and we didn't construct any of
 

1841
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,750
right and we didn't construct any of
those all right

1842
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:37,760
those all right
 

1843
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,790
those all right
so we construct this graph g prime we

1844
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:40,800
so we construct this graph g prime we
 

1845
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,870
so we construct this graph g prime we
can do that in linear time with respect

1846
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:42,880
can do that in linear time with respect
 

1847
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,230
can do that in linear time with respect
to these things i just go through all

1855
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,069

i just do it naively right i can do that

1856
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
i just do it naively right i can do that
 

1857
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:52,790
i just do it naively right i can do that

we just look at the witnesses because

we just look at the witnesses because

then those shortest path distances
 

2015
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,230
then those shortest path distances
are the same as these k edge shortest

2016
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:52,240
are the same as these k edge shortest
 

2017

00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
end of the algorithm
 

2059
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,549
end of the algorithm
basically i'm looking for all the

2060
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:10,559
basically i'm looking for all the
 

2061
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,710
basically i'm looking for all the
witnesses

2062
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
witnesses
 

2063
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,270
witnesses
for each witness i find all the vertices

2064
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,280
for each witness i find all the vertices
 

2065
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,309
for each witness i find all the vertices
reachable from it

2066
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
reachable from it
 

2067
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,950
reachable from it
and set it to minus infinity just as we

2068
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
and set it to minus infinity just as we
 

2069
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,990
and set it to minus infinity just as we
argued before

2070
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,000
argued before
 

2071
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,230
argued before
okay so it remains to prove this claim

2072
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240

 

2073
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,670

how do we prove this claim

2074
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:31,680

 

2075
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,950

well we can induct on k

2076
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
well we can induct on k
 

2077
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,069
well we can induct on k
right is this true for k

2078
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:38,079
right is this true for k
 

2079
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,030
right is this true for k
equals zero yeah right we kind of

2080
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
equals zero yeah right we kind of
 

2081
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,510
equals zero yeah right we kind of
already

2082
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
already
 

2083
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,349
already
argued it over here when we are talking

2084
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
argued it over here when we are talking
 

2085
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,069
argued it over here when we are talking
about our initialization step or what

2086
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
about our initialization step or what
 

2087
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,390
about our initialization step or what
what

2088
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400
what
 

2089
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,510
what
dag relaxation does it'll set this to be

2090
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
dag relaxation does it'll set this to be
 

2091
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,549
dag relaxation does it'll set this to be
the shortest path

2092
00:48:50,549 --> 00:48:50,559
the shortest path
 

2093
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,349
the shortest path
from this guy to all these vertices

2094
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:53,359
from this guy to all these vertices
 

2095
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,109
from this guy to all these vertices
these aren't reachable from here

2096
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:55,119
these aren't reachable from here
 

2097
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,510
these aren't reachable from here
and so these are infinite and that one's

2098
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:57,520
and so these are infinite and that one's
 

2099
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,430
and so these are infinite and that one's
zero

2100
00:48:59,430 --> 00:48:59,440
zero
 

2101
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,109
zero
okay so the base case

2102
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119
okay so the base case
 

2103
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,109
okay so the base case
so induct

2104
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:07,119
so induct
 

2105
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,510
so induct
on k

2106
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:11,520

 

2107
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,950

base case k equals zero

2108
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:14,960
base case k equals zero
 

2109
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,990
base case k equals zero
check right that's all good

2110
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:18,000
check right that's all good
 

2111
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,790
check right that's all good
now we induct in our inductive step

2112
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800

 

2113
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,549

let's take a look at the shortest path

2114
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:24,559
let's take a look at the shortest path
 

2115
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,150
let's take a look at the shortest path
distance from zero

2116
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
distance from zero
 

2117
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,589
distance from zero
from s zero to v of k

2118
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599
from s zero to v of k
 

2119
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,710
from s zero to v of k
prime for some k prime and the

2120
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
prime for some k prime and the
 

2121
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,950
prime for some k prime and the
assumption is the inductive hypothesis

2122
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
assumption is the inductive hypothesis
 

2123
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,670
assumption is the inductive hypothesis
is

2124
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:35,680
is
 

2125
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,349
is
that this distance is the

2126
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
that this distance is the
 

2127
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,549
that this distance is the
k edge distance for all k prime less

2128
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:42,559
k edge distance for all k prime less
 

2129
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:43,109
k edge distance for all k prime less
than k

2130
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:43,119
than k
 

2131
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,950
than k
i mean all k less than k prime right

2132
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
i mean all k less than k prime right
 

2133
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,030
i mean all k less than k prime right
well kind of by definition of a shortest

2134
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
well kind of by definition of a shortest
 

2135
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,069

00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,829
go
first through some vertex in the layer

before it
which is one of these and in particular

2174
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:44,800
which is one of these and in particular
 

2175
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,470
which is one of these and in particular
i'm only connected to

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,109
things uh adjacent to me
that's all this is saying right i have

2180
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119
that's all this is saying right i have
 

2181
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,710
that's all this is saying right i have
to go through that vertex

2182
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:52,720
to go through that vertex
 

2183
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,150
to go through that vertex
and take some shortest path to one of

2184
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,160
and take some shortest path to one of
 

2185
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,430
and take some shortest path to one of
those previous vertices

2186
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:57,440

 

2187
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,630

now in actuality

2188
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:00,640

 

2189
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,589

these adjacencies i constructed them to

2190
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:03,599
these adjacencies i constructed them to
 

2191
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,150
these adjacencies i constructed them to
be

2192
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:04,160
be
 

2193
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,829
be
similar to the adjacencies in my

00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
similar to the adjacencies in my

original graph

2196
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
original graph
 

2197
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,829
original graph
in addition to one edge coming from my

00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
in addition to one edge coming from my
 

2199
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,030
in addition to one edge coming from my
original vertex

2200
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
original vertex
 

2201
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,910
original vertex
right from from vertex v so this is the

2202
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:13,920
right from from vertex v so this is the
 

2203
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,630
right from from vertex v so this is the
same as the minimum

2204
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:16,640
same as the minimum
 

2205
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,150
same as the minimum
of this set delta s naught

2206
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,160
of this set delta s naught
 

2207
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,630
of this set delta s naught
same thing

2208
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:26,640

 

2209
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,230

plus wuv

2210
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,240
plus wuv

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:37,750
plus wuv
for all uh

2212
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:37,760
for all uh
 

2213
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,109
for all uh
u in the adjacent incoming adjacencies

of my original vertex

2216
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:46,400
of my original vertex
 

2217
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,069
of my original vertex
in addition to one more term what is

2218
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:48,079
in addition to one more term what is
 

2219
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:54,150
in addition to one more term what is
that other term

2220
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160

 

2221
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,510

these are all of the things

2222
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
these are all of the things
 

2223
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,670
these are all of the things
corresponding to my incoming edges

2224
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
corresponding to my incoming edges
 

2225
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,750
corresponding to my incoming edges
in my original thing but i also have

2226
00:51:59,750 --> 00:51:59,760
in my original thing but i also have
 

2227
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,990
in my original thing but i also have
that one edge coming from the

2228
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
that one edge coming from the
 

2229
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,990
that one edge coming from the

v of k prime minus 1.

2238
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:16,839

 

2239
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,390

awful i think there's another one here

2240
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:20,400
awful i think there's another one here
 

2241
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,549
awful i think there's another one here
this is s naught v of k prime minus one

2242
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:24,559
this is s naught v of k prime minus one
 

2243
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:33,990
this is s naught v of k prime minus one
okay i'm not going to rewrite it okay

2244
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,000

 

2245
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,190

then by induction this thing

2246
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
then by induction this thing
 

2247
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,710
then by induction this thing
and this thing must be the edge shortest

2248
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720
and this thing must be the edge shortest
 

2249
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,309
and this thing must be the edge shortest
paths using

2250
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,319
paths using
 

2251
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,750
paths using
k minus one vertices and then that's

2252
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:45,760
k minus one vertices and then that's
 

2253
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:45,990
k minus one vertices and then that's
just

2254
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:46,000
just
 

2255
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,589
just
the statement of what the shortest path

2256
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:49,599
the statement of what the shortest path
 

2257
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,790
the statement of what the shortest path
should be

2258
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,800

 

2259
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,150

using at most k prime

2260
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,160
using at most k prime
 

2261
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,510
using at most k prime
edges going from s to v

2262
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,520
edges going from s to v
 

2263
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,190
edges going from s to v
okay so

2264
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:03,200
okay so
 

2265
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,910
okay so
these things are the same as we clamped

2266
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:05,920
these things are the same as we clamped
 

2267
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,630
these things are the same as we clamped
yay

2268
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
yay
 

2269
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,910
yay
check all right and then it's

2270
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:09,920
check all right and then it's
 

2271
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,910
check all right and then it's
not such a triv it's it's kind of a

2272
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:11,920
not such a triv it's it's kind of a
 

2273
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,470
not such a triv it's it's kind of a
trivial leap then to say that at the end

2274
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:14,480
trivial leap then to say that at the end
 

2275
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,430
trivial leap then to say that at the end

that invariant means that these things

2294
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,000
that invariant means that these things
 

2295
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,349
that invariant means that these things
correspond to

00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:39,359
correspond to
 

2297
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,790
correspond to
exactly this claim over here

2298
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:44,800

 

2299
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,030

it's a witness

2300
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,040

 

2301
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,790

and then finding all the vertices

2302
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
and then finding all the vertices
 

2303
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,950
and then finding all the vertices

we said all of the infinite ones

2306
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
we said all of the infinite ones
 

2307
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,109
we said all of the infinite ones
to be minus infinity as desired okay so

2308
00:53:59,109 --> 00:53:59,119
to be minus infinity as desired okay so
 

2309
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,470
to be minus infinity as desired okay so
what's the running time of this thing

2310
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:02,480

 

2311
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,549

well we have to construct this graph so

2312
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:04,559
well we have to construct this graph so
 

2313
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,069
well we have to construct this graph so
we had to take that time

2314
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:06,079
we had to take that time
 

2315
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,790
we had to take that time
okay we ran dag relaxation that takes

2316
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
okay we ran dag relaxation that takes
 

2317
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,150
okay we ran dag relaxation that takes
the same amount of time

2318
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:10,160
the same amount of time
 

2319
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,190
the same amount of time
right for every vertex we did order v

2320
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
right for every vertex we did order v
 

2321
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,549
right for every vertex we did order v
work and then for each witness how many

2322
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:16,559
work and then for each witness how many
 

2323
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,190
work and then for each witness how many
could there be

2324
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:17,200
could there be
 

2325
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,150
could there be
at most v checking the reachability of

2326
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160
at most v checking the reachability of
 

2327
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,190
at most v checking the reachability of
each vertex

2328
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,200
each vertex
 

2329
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,950
each vertex
that can be done in how long order e

2330
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:24,960
that can be done in how long order e
 

2331
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,470
that can be done in how long order e
time right because we don't need to

2332
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,480
time right because we don't need to
 

2333
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,870
time right because we don't need to
consider the things that aren't

2334
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:30,880
consider the things that aren't
 

2335
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,589
consider the things that aren't
connected

2336
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:31,599
connected
 

2337
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,870
connected
to x or aren't connected to the witness

2338
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
to x or aren't connected to the witness
 

2339
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,549
to x or aren't connected to the witness
right so this thing takes order

2340
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:38,559
right so this thing takes order
 

2341
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,630
right so this thing takes order
v times e work so we're upper bounded by

2342
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:42,640
v times e work so we're upper bounded by
 

2343
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,910
v times e work so we're upper bounded by
this

2344
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:43,920
this
 

2345
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,829
this
the time it took to construct the

2346
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:45,839
the time it took to construct the
 

2347
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,190
the time it took to construct the
original graph

2348
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
original graph
 

2349
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,190
original graph
and by the claim we had before

2350
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,200

 

2351
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,150

that takes v times e time okay so that's

2352
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,160
that takes v times e time okay so that's
 

2353
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,549
that takes v times e time okay so that's

a to b to c to d to b
 

2401
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,390
a to b to c to d to b
thank you that's a path of length four

2402
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
thank you that's a path of length four
 

2403
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,789
thank you that's a path of length four
of four of edges

2404
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:08,799
of four of edges
 

2405
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,910
of four of edges
that has shorter path than any path that

2406
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:11,920
that has shorter path than any path that
 

2407
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,870
that has shorter path than any path that
has

2408
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:12,880
has
 

2409
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,470
has
fewer edges in particular there's only

2410
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,480
fewer edges in particular there's only
 

2411
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,069
fewer edges in particular there's only
one other path to be

2412
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
one other path to be
 

2413
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,630
one other path to be
using fewer than four uh there's two

2414
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:18,640
using fewer than four uh there's two
 

2415
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,990
using fewer than four uh there's two
other paths

2416
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
other paths
 

2417
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,870
other paths
one path of length that has one edge

2418
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:22,880
one path of length that has one edge
 

2419
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,309
one path of length that has one edge
that has weight minus five

2420
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
that has weight minus five
 

2421
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,030
that has weight minus five
and one path this path that has weight

2422
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,040
and one path this path that has weight
 

2423
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,030
and one path this path that has weight
nine minus one is eight

2424
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
nine minus one is eight
 

2425
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,870
nine minus one is eight
right whereas this path minus 5 minus 4

2426
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
right whereas this path minus 5 minus 4
 

2427
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,870
right whereas this path minus 5 minus 4
3 minus 1 has minus 10

2428
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:36,880
3 minus 1 has minus 10
 

2429
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,390
3 minus 1 has minus 10
plus 3 is minus 7 which is shorter

2430
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,400
plus 3 is minus 7 which is shorter
 

2431
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,230
plus 3 is minus 7 which is shorter
than minus 5. so b indeed is a witness

2432
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,240
than minus 5. so b indeed is a witness
 

2433
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,190
than minus 5. so b indeed is a witness
right and if we actually take a look at

2434
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:47,200
right and if we actually take a look at
 

2435
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,549
right and if we actually take a look at
that path

2436
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:48,559
that path
 

2437
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,230
that path
through this graph going from a

2438
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:52,240
through this graph going from a
 

2439
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,630
through this graph going from a
to b to c

2440
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:56,640
to b to c
 

2441
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:03,270
to b to c
to d back to b

2442
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,280

 

2443
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,150

we see that there's a negative weight

2444
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:06,160
we see that there's a negative weight
 

2445
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,150
we see that there's a negative weight
cycle in this graph

2446
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160
cycle in this graph
 

2447
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,230
cycle in this graph
b to c to d to b and indeed that's

2448
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
b to c to d to b and indeed that's
 

2449
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,950
b to c to d to b and indeed that's
always the case for our witnesses

2450
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:14,960
always the case for our witnesses
 

2451
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,710
always the case for our witnesses
okay you can see a proof of that in the

2452
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
okay you can see a proof of that in the
 

2453
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,910
okay you can see a proof of that in the
notes and you can see in recitation

2454
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:19,920
notes and you can see in recitation
 

2455
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,589
notes and you can see in recitation
a little space optimization to make us

2456
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
a little space optimization to make us
 

2457
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,589
a little space optimization to make us
not have to construct this entire graph

2458
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:25,599
not have to construct this entire graph
 

2459
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:26,630
not have to construct this entire graph
on the fly

2460

on the fly
 

2461
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,510
on the fly
but actually only use order v space

2462
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:29,520
but actually only use order v space
 

2463
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,630
but actually only use order v space
while we're going okay

2464
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:30,640
while we're going okay
 

2465
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,870

so that's bellman ford sorry for running

2466
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:32,880
so that's bellman ford sorry for running
 

2467
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:41,440
so that's bellman ford sorry for running
a little late
