and then just directly calling the

172
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
and then just directly calling the
 

173
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,670
and then just directly calling the
recursive things but then at the end

174
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
recursive things but then at the end
 

175
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,149

you have to pay for that guess by

176
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
you have to pay for that guess by
 

177
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,750
you have to pay for that guess by
looping over all possible guesses in

178
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
looping over all possible guesses in
 

179
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,190

order to guarantee that you actually

180
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
order to guarantee that you actually
 

181
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,949
order to guarantee that you actually
find the right one

182
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959

 

183
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,869

so once you identify this question it's

184
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
so once you identify this question it's
 

185
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,110
so once you identify this question it's
very easy dp is all about

just brute force anything that you want
 

189
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,869
just brute force anything that you want
and usually that leads to pretty good

190
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879

00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
and then it it's often reduces to
 

203
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,509
and then it it's often reduces to
finding a path

204
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,790
and we want to maximize the total value
naturally

342
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
naturally
 

343
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,830
naturally
so here's an example

344
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840

 

345
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,590

let's say our original length is seven

346
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
let's say our original length is seven
 

347
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,670
let's say our original length is seven
and we have this table

348
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
and we have this table
 

349
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,350
and we have this table
for lengths one two three four five

350
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
for lengths one two three four five
 

351
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,309
for lengths one two three four five
six seven all the different lengths i'm

352
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
six seven all the different lengths i'm
 

353
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,510
six seven all the different lengths i'm
going to write down

354
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
going to write down
 

355
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,830
going to write down
a value that's an integer

356
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
a value that's an integer
 

357
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,189
a value that's an integer
cutting off a route of that length and

358
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
cutting off a route of that length and
 

359
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,029
cutting off a route of that length and
selling it select

360
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
selling it select
 

361
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,309
selling it select
sell price

362
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319

 

363
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,469

it's presumably monotonic but doesn't

364
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
it's presumably monotonic but doesn't
 

365
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,350
it's presumably monotonic but doesn't
have to be

366
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
have to be
 

367
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,589
have to be
maybe people really like buying powers

368
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
maybe people really like buying powers
 

369
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,110
maybe people really like buying powers
of two length or something and so those

370
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
of two length or something and so those
 

371
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,270
of two length or something and so those
sell higher so it doesn't have to be

372
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
sell higher so it doesn't have to be
 

373
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,589
sell higher so it doesn't have to be
monotonic but in this example it is

374
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
monotonic but in this example it is
 

375
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,230
monotonic but in this example it is
and so i have this route of length seven

376
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
and so i have this route of length seven
 

377
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,550
and so i have this route of length seven
and i could sell it directly for 32

378
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
and i could sell it directly for 32
 

379
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,309
and i could sell it directly for 32
dollars let's say

dollars let's say
 

381
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,469

but i could also split it into say uh

00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,589
let's see slightly slightly worse than
four or was fourth the best

00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599

 

437
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,830

slightly worse than four what do you

438
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
slightly worse than four what do you
 

439
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,150
slightly worse than four what do you
mean

440
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160

 

441
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,990

oh slightly i see the ratio is slightly

442
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
oh slightly i see the ratio is slightly
 

443
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,190
oh slightly i see the ratio is slightly
less than four thank you

444
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
less than four thank you
 

445
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,029
less than four thank you
yeah uh which all of these others are

446
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
yeah uh which all of these others are
 

447
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,909
yeah uh which all of these others are
somewhat worse for example two uh if i

448
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
somewhat worse for example two uh if i
 

449
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,310
somewhat worse for example two uh if i
double

450
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
double
 

451
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,110
double
the 3 value i get 26 which is quite a

452
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
the 3 value i get 26 which is quite a
 

453
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,910
the 3 value i get 26 which is quite a
bit less than 31

454
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
bit less than 31
 

455
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,550
bit less than 31
and i guess the the closest competitor i

456
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
and i guess the the closest competitor i
 

457
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,150
and i guess the the closest competitor i
think is 2

458
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
think is 2
 

459
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,670
think is 2
because if you multiply this by 3 you

460
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
because if you multiply this by 3 you
 

461
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,750
because if you multiply this by 3 you
get 30. so if i sold three

462
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
get 30. so if i sold three
 

463
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,070
get 30. so if i sold three
twos i get 30 but if i sell one six

464
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
twos i get 30 but if i sell one six
 

465
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,350
twos i get 30 but if i sell one six
which is the same quantity

466
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
which is the same quantity
 

467
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,949
which is the same quantity
i get 31 so slight improvement

468
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
i get 31 so slight improvement
 

469
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,230
i get 31 so slight improvement
and so this this item maximizes bank for

470
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
and so this this item maximizes bank for
 

471
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,630
and so this this item maximizes bank for
buck

472
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
buck
 

473
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,190
buck
that ratio and so one natural partition

474
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
that ratio and so one natural partition
 

475
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,190
that ratio and so one natural partition
is six plus one

476
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
is six plus one
 

477
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,190
is six plus one
i sell one rod of length six and that

478
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
i sell one rod of length six and that
 

479
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,509
i sell one rod of length six and that
leaves a rod of length one

480
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
leaves a rod of length one
 

481
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,350
leaves a rod of length one
and this will give me uh 31

482
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
and this will give me uh 31
 

483
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,750
and this will give me uh 31
for the six and one dollar which gives

484
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
for the six and one dollar which gives
 

485
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,389
for the six and one dollar which gives
me

486
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
me
 

487
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,910
me
32 dollars uh but this turns out to not

488
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
32 dollars uh but this turns out to not
 

489
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,190
32 dollars uh but this turns out to not
be the best

490
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
be the best
 

491
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,710
be the best
which is actually the same as if you

492
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
which is actually the same as if you
 

493
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,230
which is actually the same as if you
just sold it outright

494
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
just sold it outright
 

495
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,190
just sold it outright
but in fact you can do better by selling

496
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
but in fact you can do better by selling
 

497
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,310
but in fact you can do better by selling
this is not obvious

498
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
this is not obvious
 

499
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,829
this is not obvious
stare at it for a while a three and a

four
 

503
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,310
four
also sums to 7 then we get 13

504
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
also sums to 7 then we get 13
 

505
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,430
also sums to 7 then we get 13
plus 18 which is

506
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
plus 18 which is
 

507
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,910
plus 18 which is
hopefully bigger 33 30

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,949
hopefully bigger 33 30
get this right nope i did not get it

510
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
get this right nope i did not get it
 

511
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,230
get this right nope i did not get it
right

512
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
right
 

513
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,350
right
uh that's too small

514
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
uh that's too small
 

515
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,430
uh that's too small
uh we're going to take these two and

516
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
uh we're going to take these two and
 

517
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,630
uh we're going to take these two and
sell 3

518
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
sell 3
 

519
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,910
sell 3
plus 2 plus 2.

520
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
plus 2 plus 2.
 

521
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,350
plus 2 plus 2.
then i get 13 plus 10 plus 10 remember

522
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
then i get 13 plus 10 plus 10 remember
 

523
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,269
then i get 13 plus 10 plus 10 remember
two was a close competitor first

524
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
two was a close competitor first
 

525
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,509
two was a close competitor first
for the ratio for six so it's a little

526
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
for the ratio for six so it's a little
 

527
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,949
for the ratio for six so it's a little
better to sell twos

528
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
better to sell twos
 

529
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,269
better to sell twos
two twos and then a three because then

530
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
two twos and then a three because then
 

531
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,710
two twos and then a three because then
we get thirty three dollars

532
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
we get thirty three dollars
 

533
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,069
we get thirty three dollars
and that turns out to be the best for

534
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
and that turns out to be the best for
 

535
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,069
and that turns out to be the best for
this problem and it seems really

536
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
this problem and it seems really
 

537
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,590
this problem and it seems really
tricky to figure this out in general

538
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
tricky to figure this out in general
 

539
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,509
tricky to figure this out in general
there are

540
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
there are
 

541
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,750
there are
exponentially many different partitions

542
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
exponentially many different partitions
 

543
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,430
exponentially many different partitions
can't afford to try them all

544
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
can't afford to try them all
 

545
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,790
can't afford to try them all
question can i have negative values

546
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
question can i have negative values
 

547
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,670
question can i have negative values
can i have negative values in here uh i

548
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
can i have negative values in here uh i
 

549
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:31,990
can i have negative values in here uh i
think

550
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
think
 

551
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,710
think
that will work fine i'm not allowed to

552
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
that will work fine i'm not allowed to
 

553
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,630
that will work fine i'm not allowed to
have negative lengths or zero lengths i

554
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
have negative lengths or zero lengths i
 

555
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,069
have negative lengths or zero lengths i
don't want zero length to actually give

556
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
don't want zero length to actually give
 

557
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,350
don't want zero length to actually give
you something because then i just

558
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
you something because then i just
 

559
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,069
you something because then i just
cut infinitely many zeros but uh the v

560
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
cut infinitely many zeros but uh the v
 

561
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,829
cut infinitely many zeros but uh the v
of l i think could be negative

562
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
of l i think could be negative
 

563
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,670
of l i think could be negative
yeah do i have to use a whole bar

564
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
yeah do i have to use a whole bar
 

565
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,710
yeah do i have to use a whole bar
uh in this problem yes

566
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
uh in this problem yes
 

567
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,790
uh in this problem yes
i think it wouldn't change much if you

568
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
i think it wouldn't change much if you
 

569
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,069
i think it wouldn't change much if you
didn't have to use the whole bar we can

570
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
didn't have to use the whole bar we can
 

571
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,509
didn't have to use the whole bar we can
think about those after we write the dp

572
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
think about those after we write the dp
 

573
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,190
think about those after we write the dp
so um let's

574
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
so um let's
 

575
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,829
so um let's
solve this with sort bot

576
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839

 

577
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,389

so what's the input to this problem well

578
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
so what's the input to this problem well
 

579
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,750
so what's the input to this problem well
we have

580
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
we have
 

581
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,829
we have
uh i didn't mention this is an integer

582
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
uh i didn't mention this is an integer
 

583
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,550
uh i didn't mention this is an integer
length

584
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560

 

585
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,269

positive integer length

586
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279

 

587
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,590

so we have one input which is an integer

588
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
so we have one input which is an integer
 

589
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,870
so we have one input which is an integer
l and we have another input which is

590
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
l and we have another input which is
 

591
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,550
l and we have another input which is
i guess it's like an array of integers

592
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
i guess it's like an array of integers
 

593
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,590
i guess it's like an array of integers
so this is a sequence

594
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
so this is a sequence
 

595
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,230
so this is a sequence
and this is an integer so if we look at

596
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
and this is an integer so if we look at
 

597
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,030
and this is an integer so if we look at
our

598
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
our
 

599
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,790
our
list of nice sub problems we could try

600
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
list of nice sub problems we could try
 

601
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,190
list of nice sub problems we could try
prefixes or suffixes or substrings of

602
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
prefixes or suffixes or substrings of
 

603
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,190
prefixes or suffixes or substrings of
the value

604
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
the value
 

605
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,470
the value
structure or we could try

606
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
structure or we could try
 

607
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,750
structure or we could try
for that integer smaller integers that's

608
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
for that integer smaller integers that's
 

609
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,269
for that integer smaller integers that's
actually what i prefer

610
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
actually what i prefer
 

611
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,550
actually what i prefer
i think the way to think about this is

612
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
i think the way to think about this is
 

613
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,350
i think the way to think about this is
to jump ahead to what do we want to

614
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
to jump ahead to what do we want to
 

615
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,190
to jump ahead to what do we want to
what feature of the solution do we want

616
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
what feature of the solution do we want
 

617
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,509
what feature of the solution do we want
to guess

618
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
to guess
 

619
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,389
to guess
and presumably we should think about

620
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
and presumably we should think about
 

621
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,030
and presumably we should think about
what is

622
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
what is
 

623
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,430
what is
some length of rod that we will cut and

624
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
some length of rod that we will cut and
 

625
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,949
some length of rod that we will cut and
sell

626
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
sell
 

627
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,710
sell
okay so i have this big rod maybe i sell

628
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
okay so i have this big rod maybe i sell
 

629
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,550
okay so i have this big rod maybe i sell
the whole thing maybe i cut off a thing

630
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
the whole thing maybe i cut off a thing
 

631
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,310
the whole thing maybe i cut off a thing
of size one and sell it maybe i

632
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
of size one and sell it maybe i
 

633
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,550
of size one and sell it maybe i
cut off a thing of size two and sell it

634
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
cut off a thing of size two and sell it
 

635
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,389
cut off a thing of size two and sell it
um but i have to sell

636
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
um but i have to sell
 

637
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,470
um but i have to sell
something unless i'm not selling

638
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
something unless i'm not selling
 

639
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,990
something unless i'm not selling
anything

640
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
anything
 

641
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,030
anything
and so uh that's there's only n

642
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
and so uh that's there's only n
 

643
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,750
and so uh that's there's only n
different or

644
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
different or
 

645
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,230
different or
there's only l different choices for

646
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
there's only l different choices for
 

647
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,949
there's only l different choices for
what uh

648
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
what uh
 

649
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,990
what uh
rod lengths to cut off first and so we

650
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
rod lengths to cut off first and so we
 

651
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,269
rod lengths to cut off first and so we
can just brute force that

652
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
can just brute force that
 

653
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,870
can just brute force that
in order l time so what problem do we

654
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
in order l time so what problem do we
 

655
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,190
in order l time so what problem do we
get

656
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
get
 

657
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,389
get
if we cut off an integer of some small l

658
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
if we cut off an integer of some small l
 

659
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,350
if we cut off an integer of some small l
length

660
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
length
 

661
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,829
length
well we just get the same problem with a

662
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
well we just get the same problem with a
 

663
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,990
well we just get the same problem with a
rod of length capital l minus small l

664
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
rod of length capital l minus small l
 

665
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,030
rod of length capital l minus small l
the values don't change

666
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
the values don't change
 

667
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,389
the values don't change
it happens that i won't use the big

668
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
it happens that i won't use the big
 

669
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,790
it happens that i won't use the big
values if i cut off some amount of the

670
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
values if i cut off some amount of the
 

671
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,550
values if i cut off some amount of the
the problem but i like to think of this

672
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
the problem but i like to think of this
 

673
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,829
the problem but i like to think of this
as we're just all we're doing is

674
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
as we're just all we're doing is
 

675
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,509
as we're just all we're doing is
decreasing big l

676
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
decreasing big l
 

677
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,550
decreasing big l
and so my sub problems are going to be

678
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
and so my sub problems are going to be
 

679
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,710
and so my sub problems are going to be
uh for each small l

680
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
uh for each small l
 

681
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,949
uh for each small l
less than or equal to big l solve that

682
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
less than or equal to big l solve that
 

683
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,069
less than or equal to big l solve that
problem

684
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
problem
 

685
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:19,990
problem
so x of l is max value partition

686
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
so x of l is max value partition
 

687
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,389
so x of l is max value partition
of uh length

688
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
of uh length
 

689
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,910
of uh length
l little l for

690
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
l little l for
 

691
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,190
l little l for
little l equals zero one

692
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
little l equals zero one
 

693
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,710
little l equals zero one
up to big l okay so just same problem

694
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
up to big l okay so just same problem
 

695
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,629
up to big l okay so just same problem
but with different choices for big l so

696
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
but with different choices for big l so
 

697
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,069
but with different choices for big l so
this is using

698
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
this is using
 

699
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,910
this is using
this integer sub problem now in this

700
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
this integer sub problem now in this
 

701
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,829
this integer sub problem now in this
example that happens to correspond to

702
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
example that happens to correspond to
 

703
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,990
example that happens to correspond to
prefixes of the v

704
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
prefixes of the v
 

705
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,949
prefixes of the v
array because if i only have length up

706
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
array because if i only have length up
 

707
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,670
array because if i only have length up
to little l

708
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
to little l
 

709
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,110
to little l
that i really only need the prefix of

710
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
that i really only need the prefix of
 

711
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,110
that i really only need the prefix of
the value array up to

712
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
the value array up to
 

713
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,710
the value array up to
little l so you could think of it that

714
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
little l so you could think of it that
 

715
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,310
little l so you could think of it that
way that's also fine

716
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
way that's also fine
 

717
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,670
way that's also fine
but i think this way is a little more

718
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
but i think this way is a little more
 

719
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,629
but i think this way is a little more
generalizable

720
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639

 

721
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,069

okay so i claim this is a good set of

722
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
okay so i claim this is a good set of
 

723
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,590
okay so i claim this is a good set of
sub problems because

724
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
sub problems because
 

725
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,069
sub problems because
i can write a recurrence relation which

726
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
i can write a recurrence relation which
 

727
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,710
i can write a recurrence relation which
is

728
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
is
 

729
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,750
is
actually pretty simple

730
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760

 

731
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,949

like i said

732
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959

 

733
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,269

uh we want to choose

734
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279

 

735
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,389

some piece so we're given a rod of

736
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
some piece so we're given a rod of
 

737
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,069
some piece so we're given a rod of
length little l

738
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
length little l
 

739
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,990
length little l
i want to choose how much of that rod to

740
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
i want to choose how much of that rod to
 

741
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,910
i want to choose how much of that rod to
sell in the next piece so i could cut

742
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
sell in the next piece so i could cut
 

743
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,790
sell in the next piece so i could cut
off

744
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
off
 

745
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,790
off
something of length one or i could sell

746
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
something of length one or i could sell
 

747
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,069
something of length one or i could sell
the whole thing or

748
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
the whole thing or
 

749
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,269
the whole thing or
cut off any piece size in between

750
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
cut off any piece size in between
 

751
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,110
cut off any piece size in between
and the money i will get for that is

752
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
and the money i will get for that is
 

753
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,350
and the money i will get for that is
whatever the value of that piece is

754
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
whatever the value of that piece is
 

755
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,949
whatever the value of that piece is
plus recursively the maximum i can get

756
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
plus recursively the maximum i can get
 

757
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,670
plus recursively the maximum i can get
from all the remaining pieces sorry from

758
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
from all the remaining pieces sorry from
 

759
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,509
from all the remaining pieces sorry from
the remaining length which is

760
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
the remaining length which is
 

761
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,710
the remaining length which is
little l minus p

762
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720

 

763
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,430

okay so very simple inside the formula

764
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
okay so very simple inside the formula
 

765
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,110
okay so very simple inside the formula
just the value for the first piece we're

766
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
just the value for the first piece we're
 

767
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,550
just the value for the first piece we're
guessing what is the first piece we'll

768
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
guessing what is the first piece we'll
 

769
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,910
guessing what is the first piece we'll
cut off and sell

770
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
cut off and sell
 

771
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,750
cut off and sell
we get the value for that piece and then

772
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
we get the value for that piece and then
 

773
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,949
we get the value for that piece and then
recursively

774
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
recursively
 

775
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,550
recursively
we see what's the best we can do with

776
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
we see what's the best we can do with
 

777
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,310
we see what's the best we can do with
the remainder now we don't know what

778
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
the remainder now we don't know what
 

779
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,790
the remainder now we don't know what
size

780
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
size
 

781
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,470
size
the first piece should be so we just

782
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
the first piece should be so we just
 

783
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,069
the first piece should be so we just
brute force it we try all possible

784
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
brute force it we try all possible
 

785
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,189
brute force it we try all possible
choices for p

786
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
choices for p
 

787
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,870
choices for p
and take the max that we get out of this

788
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
and take the max that we get out of this
 

789
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,470
and take the max that we get out of this
formula

790
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
formula
 

791
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,110
formula
over that choice and that's guaranteed

792
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
over that choice and that's guaranteed
 

793
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,110
over that choice and that's guaranteed
to find the best overall

794
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120

 

795
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,990

because we must cut off some piece now

796
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
because we must cut off some piece now
 

797
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,590
because we must cut off some piece now
if you wanted to allow not selling

798
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
if you wanted to allow not selling
 

799
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,069
if you wanted to allow not selling
anything

800
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
anything
 

801
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,069
anything
in the case of negative numbers you

802
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
in the case of negative numbers you
 

803
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,910
in the case of negative numbers you
could just add a

804
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
could just add a
 

805
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,430
could just add a
zero to this max and then you might stop

806
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
zero to this max and then you might stop
 

807
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,949
zero to this max and then you might stop
early if there's nothing left

808
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
early if there's nothing left
 

809
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,310
early if there's nothing left
that's worth selling

810
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
that's worth selling
 

811
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,230
that's worth selling
okay topological order is very simple

812
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
okay topological order is very simple
 

813
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,629
okay topological order is very simple
we just have these capital l different

814
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
we just have these capital l different
 

815
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,749
we just have these capital l different
problems

816
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
problems
 

817
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,910
problems
and if you look at oh uh

818
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
and if you look at oh uh
 

819
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,790
and if you look at oh uh
yep so we're looking at l minus p p is

820
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
yep so we're looking at l minus p p is
 

821
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,990
yep so we're looking at l minus p p is
always at least one

822
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
always at least one
 

823
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,910
always at least one
so we're always strictly decreasing l in

824
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
so we're always strictly decreasing l in
 

825
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,350
so we're always strictly decreasing l in
this recursive call

and so as long as i solve the problems

828
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
and so as long as i solve the problems
 

829
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,710

in order of
increasing little l i'll guarantee

832
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
increasing little l i'll guarantee
 

833
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,829
increasing little l i'll guarantee
that whenever i'm solving x of little l

834
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
that whenever i'm solving x of little l
 

835
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,430
that whenever i'm solving x of little l
i'll have already solved all the things

836
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
i'll have already solved all the things
 

837
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,949
i'll have already solved all the things
i need to call

838
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
i need to call
 

839
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,790
i need to call
so if you're writing a bottom up dp this

840
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
so if you're writing a bottom up dp this
 

841
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,990
so if you're writing a bottom up dp this
would just be the for loop

842
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
would just be the for loop
 

843
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,269
would just be the for loop
l equals zero up to big l

844
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
l equals zero up to big l
 

845
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,710
l equals zero up to big l
in that order

846
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720

847
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,030
in that order
this is equivalent to the statement

848
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
this is equivalent to the statement
 

849
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,470
this is equivalent to the statement
but the key is to check that this is

850
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
but the key is to check that this is
 

851
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,030
but the key is to check that this is
acyclic because we're always referring

l and so increasing l is a valid

856
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
l and so increasing l is a valid
 

857
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,110
l and so increasing l is a valid

okay base case

870
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320

 

871
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,749

would be x of zero

872
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759

 

873
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,110

that's the first thing we'll want to

874
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
that's the first thing we'll want to
 

875
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,430
that's the first thing we'll want to
compute here and indeed this formula

876
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
compute here and indeed this formula
 

877
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,430
compute here and indeed this formula
doesn't make much sense if i have

878
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
doesn't make much sense if i have
 

879
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,990
doesn't make much sense if i have
x of 0 because i can't choose a number p

880
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
x of 0 because i can't choose a number p
 

881
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,470
x of 0 because i can't choose a number p
between

882
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
between
 

883
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,069
between
1 and 0. even non-strictly

884
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
1 and 0. even non-strictly
 

885
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,429
1 and 0. even non-strictly
and so what does it mean well if i have

886
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
and so what does it mean well if i have
 

887
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,270
and so what does it mean well if i have
a rod of length 0 i can't get any money

888
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
a rod of length 0 i can't get any money
 

889
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,390
a rod of length 0 i can't get any money
out of it

890
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
out of it
 

891
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,949
out of it
so that's it it's a 0.

892
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
so that's it it's a 0.
 

893
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,189
so that's it it's a 0.
that's an assumption but a reasonable

894
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
that's an assumption but a reasonable
 

895
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,549
that's an assumption but a reasonable
assumption you don't get something for

896
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
assumption you don't get something for
 

897
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,230
assumption you don't get something for
nothing

898
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
nothing
 

899
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,630
nothing
okay then we have the original problem

900
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
okay then we have the original problem
 

901
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,909
okay then we have the original problem
which is just

902
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
which is just
 

903
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,350
which is just
the length l rod

904
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
the length l rod
 

905
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,789
the length l rod
and then the time to compute this thing

906
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:34,799
and then the time to compute this thing
 

907
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,710
and then the time to compute this thing
how many sub problems are there capital

908
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
how many sub problems are there capital
 

909
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,390
how many sub problems are there capital
l plus one so we'll say

910
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
l plus one so we'll say
 

911
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,150
l plus one so we'll say
theta l sub problems

912
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160

 

913
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,510

and we'll multiply by uh

914
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
and we'll multiply by uh
 

915
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,750
and we'll multiply by uh
the amount of time to evaluate this max

916
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
the amount of time to evaluate this max
 

917
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,510
the amount of time to evaluate this max
just a constant number of things in here

918
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
just a constant number of things in here
 

919
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,909
just a constant number of things in here
not counting the recursive call and so

920
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
not counting the recursive call and so
 

921
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,549
not counting the recursive call and so
it spent

922
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
it spent
 

923
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,870
it spent
takes little l time little l is

924
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
takes little l time little l is
 

925
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,710
takes little l time little l is
certainly at most big l

926
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
certainly at most big l
 

927
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,750
certainly at most big l
and so we'll say big o of big

928
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
and so we'll say big o of big
 

929
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,390
and so we'll say big o of big
l time it's actually a triangular number

930
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
l time it's actually a triangular number
 

931
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,669
l time it's actually a triangular number
but it will only affect things by a

932
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
but it will only affect things by a
 

933
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,789
but it will only affect things by a
constant factor

934
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
constant factor
 

935
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,350
constant factor
so we get l squared time

936
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360

 

937
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,950

and we're done so very simple

938
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
and we're done so very simple
 

939
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,870
and we're done so very simple
straightforward dp at this point we've

940
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
straightforward dp at this point we've
 

941
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,630
straightforward dp at this point we've
seen much more complicated examples than

942
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
seen much more complicated examples than
 

943
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,070
seen much more complicated examples than
this

944
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
this
 

945
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,830
this
but it highlights a question which is

946
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840

 

947
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,510

is uh

948
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520

 

949
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:43,510

theta l squared polynomial time

950
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
theta l squared polynomial time
 

951
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,390
theta l squared polynomial time
so is this a reasonable running time and

952
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
so is this a reasonable running time and
 

953
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,630
so is this a reasonable running time and
i

954
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
i
 

955
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,950
i
claim the answer is yes this is a

956
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
claim the answer is yes this is a
 

957
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,390
claim the answer is yes this is a
reasonable polynomial running time you

958
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
reasonable polynomial running time you
 

959
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,430
reasonable polynomial running time you
might say well of course it's a

960
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
might say well of course it's a
 

961
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,190
might say well of course it's a
polynomial look this is a polynomial

962
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
polynomial look this is a polynomial
 

963
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,390
polynomial look this is a polynomial
l squared that's a quadratic polynomial

964
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
l squared that's a quadratic polynomial
 

965
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,870
l squared that's a quadratic polynomial
but it's a quadratic polynomial in l and

966
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
but it's a quadratic polynomial in l and
 

967
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,710
but it's a quadratic polynomial in l and
we haven't really thought about this too

968
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
we haven't really thought about this too
 

969
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,590
we haven't really thought about this too
hard but

970
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
hard but
 

971
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,150
hard but
what does it mean to be polynomial time

972
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
what does it mean to be polynomial time
 

973
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,190
what does it mean to be polynomial time
um

974
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
um
 

975
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,669
um
and this is a notion that's properly

976
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
and this is a notion that's properly
 

977
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,150
and this is a notion that's properly
called strongly polynomial time

978
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
called strongly polynomial time
 

979
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,230
called strongly polynomial time
we won't worry about that strongly too

980
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
we won't worry about that strongly too
 

981
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,270
we won't worry about that strongly too
much

982
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
much
 

983
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,270
much
in this class but if you look this up

984
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
in this class but if you look this up
 

985
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,150
in this class but if you look this up
online you'll see the difference

986
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
online you'll see the difference
 

987
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,230
online you'll see the difference
polynomial time means

988
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240

 

989
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,470

that the running time is polynomial

990
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480

fit in a machine word because that's
what the case where we

1018
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
what the case where we
 

1019
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,230
what the case where we
normally work and so the natural way to

1020
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,240
normally work and so the natural way to
 

1021
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,549
normally work and so the natural way to

to measure the size of an input so in

1024
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
to measure the size of an input so in
 

1025
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,990
to measure the size of an input so in
this example

1026
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
this example
 

1027
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,630
this example
this problem rod cutting the input is a

1028
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
this problem rod cutting the input is a
 

1029
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,390
this problem rod cutting the input is a
single number l

1030
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
single number l
 

1031
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,669
single number l
and this value array v of l which is

1032
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
and this value array v of l which is
 

1033
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,029
and this value array v of l which is
capital l numbers so i would say

1034
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
capital l numbers so i would say
 

1035
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,630
capital l numbers so i would say
n integers and we've generally assumed

1036
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
n integers and we've generally assumed
 

1037
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,630
n integers and we've generally assumed
didn't mention integer value here

1038
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640

 

1039
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,310

as in throughout this class we assume

1040
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
as in throughout this class we assume
 

1041
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,149
as in throughout this class we assume
that all the integers unless otherwise

1042
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
that all the integers unless otherwise

1045
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,590
specified
fit in a word so we've got one word here

1046
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
fit in a word so we've got one word here
 

1047
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,230
fit in a word so we've got one word here
and l

1048
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
and l
 

1049
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,549
and l
words here so the total size of the

1050
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
words here so the total size of the
 

1051
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,149
words here so the total size of the
input to this problem

1052
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
input to this problem
 

1053
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,549
input to this problem
is l plus one integers in this problem

1054
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
is l plus one integers in this problem
 

1055
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,830
is l plus one integers in this problem
input size is

1056
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
input size is
 

1057
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,990
input size is
l plus one which we can think of as just

1058
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
l plus one which we can think of as just
 

1059
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,149
l plus one which we can think of as just
l that means theta l

1060
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
l that means theta l
 

1061
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,029
l that means theta l
okay so i explicitly didn't want to use

1062
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
okay so i explicitly didn't want to use
 

1063
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,270
okay so i explicitly didn't want to use
n

1064
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
n
 

1065
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,190
n
in this problem because usually we use

1066
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
in this problem because usually we use
 

1067
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,950
in this problem because usually we use
the letter n for the problem size not

1068
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
the letter n for the problem size not
 

1069
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,470
the letter n for the problem size not
quite always

1070
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
quite always
 

1071
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,630
quite always
but input size always means input size

1072
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
but input size always means input size
 

1073
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,789
but input size always means input size
and so here we can compute it

1074
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
and so here we can compute it
 

1075
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,950
and so here we can compute it
in terms of the specification it

1076
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
in terms of the specification it
 

1077
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,149
in terms of the specification it
involves l plus one

1078
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
involves l plus one
 

1079
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,430
involves l plus one
word inputs and so polynomial time

1080
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
word inputs and so polynomial time
 

1081
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,230
word inputs and so polynomial time
should be

1082
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
should be
 

1083
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,549
should be
polynomial in that input size in l plus

1084
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
polynomial in that input size in l plus
 

1085
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,549
polynomial in that input size in l plus
one in our example

1086
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
one in our example
 

1087
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,190
one in our example
so of course l squared is polynomial and

1088
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
so of course l squared is polynomial and
 

1089
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,390
so of course l squared is polynomial and
l plus one

1090
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
l plus one
 

1091
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,470
l plus one
so good yes

1092
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480

 

1093
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,990

okay the next example i'm going to show

1094
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
okay the next example i'm going to show
 

1095
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,669
okay the next example i'm going to show
is going to be very similar

1096
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
is going to be very similar
 

1097
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,990
is going to be very similar
but the answer will be no make it more

1098
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
but the answer will be no make it more
 

1099
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,710
but the answer will be no make it more
interesting

1100
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:26,720
interesting
 

1101
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,310
interesting
but it'll still seem pretty reasonable

1102
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
but it'll still seem pretty reasonable
 

1103
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,070
but it'll still seem pretty reasonable
so we'll come back to that

1104
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
so we'll come back to that
 

1105
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,110
so we'll come back to that
issue in a moment let me first show you

1106
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
issue in a moment let me first show you
 

1107
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,590
issue in a moment let me first show you
uh what the subproblem dp looks like for

1108
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
uh what the subproblem dp looks like for
 

1109
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,750
uh what the subproblem dp looks like for
this problem

1110
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
this problem
 

1111
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,430
this problem
again took me a while to draw so please

1112
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
again took me a while to draw so please
 

1113
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,190
again took me a while to draw so please
admire

1114
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
admire
 

1115
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,630
admire
so this is the same example of of these

1116
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
so this is the same example of of these
 

1117
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,549
so this is the same example of of these
values 1 10 13 18 20 31 32

1118
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,630
values 1 10 13 18 20 31 32
drawn here on a graph it's the complete

1120
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640

1121
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,590
drawn here on a graph it's the complete

1125
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,789
oriented uh in this increasing
way i think this is called a tournament

1126
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
way i think this is called a tournament
 

1127
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,909
way i think this is called a tournament
in graph theory

1128
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
in graph theory
 

1129
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,390
in graph theory
uh so we have the base case over here uh

1130
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
uh so we have the base case over here uh
 

1131
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,070
uh so we have the base case over here uh
this corresponds to a length zero rod

1132
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080
this corresponds to a length zero rod
 

1133
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,510
this corresponds to a length zero rod
where we get no money

1134
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
where we get no money
 

1135
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,190
where we get no money
and over here we have our full rod of

1136
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
and over here we have our full rod of
 

1137
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,549
and over here we have our full rod of
length seven and

1138
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
length seven and
 

1139
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,470
length seven and
i claim the best that we can do is uh 33

1140
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
i claim the best that we can do is uh 33
 

1141
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,510
i claim the best that we can do is uh 33
and what's happening here is for every

1142
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
and what's happening here is for every
 

1143
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,789
and what's happening here is for every
value like three that i could sell a rod

1144
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
value like three that i could sell a rod
 

1145
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,870
value like three that i could sell a rod
of length three for 13

1146
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880
of length three for 13
 

1147
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,110
of length three for 13
there's an edge that goes from each

1148
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
there's an edge that goes from each
 

1149
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,230
there's an edge that goes from each
vertex

1150
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,240
vertex
 

1151
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,750
vertex
to 1 3 higher

1152
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
to 1 3 higher
 

1153
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,070
to 1 3 higher
and those all have a weight of 13 on

1154
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
and those all have a weight of 13 on
 

1155
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,630
and those all have a weight of 13 on
them

1156
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640

 

1157
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,909

and then what we're essentially trying

1158
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
and then what we're essentially trying
 

1159
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,950
and then what we're essentially trying
to do is find a longest path from here

1160
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
to do is find a longest path from here
 

1161
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,669
to do is find a longest path from here
to here

1162
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
to here
 

1163
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,590
to here
longest because we want to maximize the

1164
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
longest because we want to maximize the
 

1165
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,350
longest because we want to maximize the
sum of values that we get

1166
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
sum of values that we get
 

1167
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,029
sum of values that we get
and we know if we negate all the weights

1168
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
and we know if we negate all the weights
 

1169
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,310
and we know if we negate all the weights
that's the shortest path problem so we

1170
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
that's the shortest path problem so we
 

1171
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,669
that's the shortest path problem so we
could solve that with shortest paths in

1172
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
could solve that with shortest paths in
 

1173
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,950
could solve that with shortest paths in
a dag

1174
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
a dag
 

1175
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,950
a dag
but i've drawn here the shortest path

1176
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:50,960
but i've drawn here the shortest path
 

1177
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,230
but i've drawn here the shortest path
tree from

1178
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
tree from
 

1179
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,510
tree from
the base case um so it actually tells us

1180
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,520
the base case um so it actually tells us
 

1181
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,470
the base case um so it actually tells us
that

1182
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
that
 

1183
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,870
that
if we had a rod of length seven the best

1184
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
if we had a rod of length seven the best
 

1185
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,830
if we had a rod of length seven the best
thing to do

1186
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
thing to do
 

1187
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,070
thing to do
is to sell it directly for thirty one

1188
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
is to sell it directly for thirty one
 

1189
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,510
is to sell it directly for thirty one
the bold lines here are the shortest

1190
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
the bold lines here are the shortest
 

1191
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,870
the bold lines here are the shortest
path tree

1192
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:04,880
path tree
 

1193
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,909
path tree
or the longest path tree i guess

1194
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
or the longest path tree i guess
 

1195
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,510
or the longest path tree i guess
and if we had something in length 10 we

1196
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
and if we had something in length 10 we
 

1197
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,110
and if we had something in length 10 we
should sell it directly if we have

1198
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
should sell it directly if we have
 

1199
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,470
should sell it directly if we have
something of length

1200
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
something of length
 

1201
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,789
something of length
20 we should sell one thing of length 2

1202
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
20 we should sell one thing of length 2
 

1203
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,990
20 we should sell one thing of length 2
and another thing of left

1204
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
and another thing of left
 

1205
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,390
and another thing of left
sorry one thing of length 4 then we

1206
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
sorry one thing of length 4 then we
 

1207
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,149
sorry one thing of length 4 then we
should sell one thing of length

1208
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
should sell one thing of length
 

1209
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,110
should sell one thing of length
10 of 2 and one of length two we get two

1210
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
10 of 2 and one of length two we get two
 

1211
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,430
10 of 2 and one of length two we get two
times ten points

1212
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
times ten points
 

1213
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,909
times ten points
and for the 33 case we sell one thing of

1214
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
and for the 33 case we sell one thing of
 

1215
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:28,710
and for the 33 case we sell one thing of
length two

1216
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
length two
 

1217
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,310
length two
one thing of length two and then one

1218
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
one thing of length two and then one
 

1219
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,750
one thing of length two and then one
thing of length three

1220
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
thing of length three
 

1221
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,990
thing of length three
is optimal so you can read lots of

1222
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
is optimal so you can read lots of
 

1223
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,350
is optimal so you can read lots of
information from this

1224
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
information from this
 

1225
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,190
information from this
and if you write down the dp code this

1226
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
and if you write down the dp code this
 

1227
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,950
and if you write down the dp code this
is effectively what it's computing

1228
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
is effectively what it's computing
 

1229
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,190
is effectively what it's computing
from left to right

1230
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200

 

1231
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,830

okay let's move on to our second problem

1232
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
okay let's move on to our second problem
 

1233
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,230
okay let's move on to our second problem
today

1234
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
today
 

1235
00:23:48,240 --> 00:24:02,470
today
which is subset sum

1236
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480

 

1237
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,269

so here we are given

1238
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279

 

1239
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:16,870

let's say a multi-set

1240
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880

 

1241
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,149

multiset means that i can repeat numbers

1242
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
multiset means that i can repeat numbers
 

1243
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,830
multiset means that i can repeat numbers
so this is just a sequence of numbers

1244
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
so this is just a sequence of numbers
 

1245
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,909
so this is just a sequence of numbers
but i'd like to use set notation because

1246
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
but i'd like to use set notation because
 

1247
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,430
but i'd like to use set notation because
i want to use subsets

1248
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
i want to use subsets
 

1249
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,430
i want to use subsets
because it's subset sum um so this is of

1250
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,440
because it's subset sum um so this is of
 

1251
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,630
because it's subset sum um so this is of
n integers

1252
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640

 

1253
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:43,190

and we're also given a target sum

1254
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200

 

1255
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:52,630

and we want to know does any subset

1256
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640

 

1257
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,190

sum to the target sum

1258
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200

 

1259
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,029

this is actually a similar problem to

1260
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,039
this is actually a similar problem to
 

1261
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,029
this is actually a similar problem to
rod cutting because rod cutting we also

1262
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
rod cutting because rod cutting we also
 

1263
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,029
rod cutting because rod cutting we also
had to split up our number l

1264
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
had to split up our number l
 

1265
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,669
had to split up our number l
into different values that summed to

1266
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
into different values that summed to
 

1267
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,430
into different values that summed to
capital l

1268
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
capital l
 

1269
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,430
capital l
so capital t here is playing the role of

1270
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
so capital t here is playing the role of
 

1271
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,710
so capital t here is playing the role of
capital l but

1272
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
capital l but
 

1273
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,549
capital l but
before we were allowed to cut into any

1274
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
before we were allowed to cut into any
 

1275
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,230
before we were allowed to cut into any
lengths and so it was easy

1276
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
lengths and so it was easy
 

1277
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,430
lengths and so it was easy
in particular l sums to l here

1278
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,440
in particular l sums to l here
 

1279
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,549
in particular l sums to l here
presumably t is not in this multiset

1280
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
presumably t is not in this multiset
 

1281
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,470
presumably t is not in this multiset
and we need to find a combination of

1282
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
and we need to find a combination of
 

1283
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,870
and we need to find a combination of
numbers here that add up exactly to t

1284
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
numbers here that add up exactly to t
 

1285
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,710
numbers here that add up exactly to t
sometimes that's possible sometimes it's

1286
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
sometimes that's possible sometimes it's
 

1287
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,070
sometimes that's possible sometimes it's
not we're only allowed to use each

1288
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
not we're only allowed to use each
 

1289
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,590
not we're only allowed to use each
number once

1290
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
number once
 

1291
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,909
number once
or as many times as it appears in the

1292
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
or as many times as it appears in the
 

1293
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,590
or as many times as it appears in the
subset

1294
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
subset
 

1295
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,870
subset
okay so here's an example

1296
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880

 

1297
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,870

say a equals two five

1298
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
say a equals two five
 

1299
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,190
say a equals two five
seven eight nine

1300
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
seven eight nine
 

1301
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,470
seven eight nine
uh and two examples are t equals 21

1302
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
uh and two examples are t equals 21
 

1303
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,510
uh and two examples are t equals 21
and t equals 25

1304
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
and t equals 25
 

1305
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,070
and t equals 25
for that same set so can i get 21

1306
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,080
for that same set so can i get 21
 

1307
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,750
for that same set so can i get 21
out of these well this involves

1308
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
out of these well this involves
 

1309
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,950
out of these well this involves
arithmetic that's hard

1310
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
arithmetic that's hard
 

1311
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,510
arithmetic that's hard
i think let's see if i add 7 and 8 i get

1312
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
i think let's see if i add 7 and 8 i get
 

1313
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,510
i think let's see if i add 7 and 8 i get
15 not quite what i want

1314
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
15 not quite what i want
 

1315
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,870
15 not quite what i want
cheat look at my answer uh yeah

1316
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:16,880
cheat look at my answer uh yeah
 

1317
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,269
cheat look at my answer uh yeah
close i see five seven nine

1318
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279

 

1319
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,950

uh so this is a yes answer to the

1320
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
uh so this is a yes answer to the
 

1321
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,190
uh so this is a yes answer to the
question does there exist any subset

1322
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200
question does there exist any subset
 

1323
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,149
question does there exist any subset
because uh 5 7 and 9

1324
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159

 

1325
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,710

sum to exactly 21 and t equals 25 i

1326
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:36,720
sum to exactly 21 and t equals 25 i
 

1327
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,070
sum to exactly 21 and t equals 25 i
don't know a good way to prove to you

1328

don't know a good way to prove to you
 

1329
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,070
don't know a good way to prove to you
that there's no way to write 25 with

1348
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279
prove to someone that the answer is no
 

1349
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,549
prove to someone that the answer is no
for a given target sum

1350
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
for a given target sum
 

1351
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,070
for a given target sum
there is a nice succinct way to prove

1352
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
there is a nice succinct way to prove
 

1353
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,350
there is a nice succinct way to prove
the answer is yes i just give you a

1354
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
the answer is yes i just give you a
 

1355
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,990
the answer is yes i just give you a
subset

1356
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000
subset
 

1357
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,310
subset
we'll talk more about that next lecture

1358
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320

 

1359
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,110

but these are some examples of the

1360
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
but these are some examples of the
 

1361
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,870
but these are some examples of the
question you might ask and the answer

1362
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
question you might ask and the answer
 

1363
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,070
question you might ask and the answer
that we're looking for this is what we

1364
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
that we're looking for this is what we
 

1365
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,390
that we're looking for this is what we
call a decision problem

1366
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
call a decision problem
 

1367
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,390
call a decision problem
in its original form we're just

1368
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
in its original form we're just
 

1369
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,430
in its original form we're just
interested in a yes or no answer

1370
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
interested in a yes or no answer
 

1371
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:27,029
interested in a yes or no answer
uh it's a single bit

1372
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039

 

1373
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,710

of course in the yes case we might

1374
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
of course in the yes case we might
 

1375
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,070
of course in the yes case we might
actually want to find the set and we can

1376
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
actually want to find the set and we can
 

1377
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,230
actually want to find the set and we can
do that as usual with parent pointers

1378
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
do that as usual with parent pointers
 

1379
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,789
do that as usual with parent pointers
just like in the bold lines over here

1380
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
just like in the bold lines over here
 

1381
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,470
just like in the bold lines over here
we'll get to that in a moment

1382
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
we'll get to that in a moment
 

1383
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,630
we'll get to that in a moment
um but this is a little bit different

1384
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
um but this is a little bit different
 

1385
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,230
um but this is a little bit different
from the most the problems we've been

1386
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
from the most the problems we've been
 

1387
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,510
from the most the problems we've been
seeing with dynamic programming are

1388
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:41,520
seeing with dynamic programming are
 

1389
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,950
seeing with dynamic programming are
optimization problems

1390
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
optimization problems
 

1391
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,470
optimization problems
and we're trying to minimize or maximize

1392
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480
and we're trying to minimize or maximize
 

1393
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,070
and we're trying to minimize or maximize
something and so we always put

1394
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
something and so we always put
 

1395
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,389
something and so we always put
a min or a max on the outside in the

1396
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
a min or a max on the outside in the
 

1397
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,110
a min or a max on the outside in the
relation

1398
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,120
relation
 

1399
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,470
relation
here we're going to have to do something

1400
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480
here we're going to have to do something
 

1401
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,710
here we're going to have to do something
that involves boolean values yes or no

1402
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
that involves boolean values yes or no
 

1403
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,710
that involves boolean values yes or no
true or false

1404
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
true or false
 

1405
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,789
true or false
okay so let's solve it this is actually

1406
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
okay so let's solve it this is actually
 

1407
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,029
okay so let's solve it this is actually
also going to be pretty straightforward

1408
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039
also going to be pretty straightforward
 

1409
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,750
also going to be pretty straightforward
um in that we can just use

1410
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
um in that we can just use
 

1411
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,190
um in that we can just use
our standard sets of subproblems

1412
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,200
our standard sets of subproblems
 

1413
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,990
our standard sets of subproblems
so just like the previous problem we

1414
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000
so just like the previous problem we
 

1415
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,310
so just like the previous problem we
have

1416
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
have
 

1417
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,590
have
on the one hand a sequence of integers

1418
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
on the one hand a sequence of integers
 

1419
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,510
on the one hand a sequence of integers
and on the other hand we're given a

1420
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,520
and on the other hand we're given a
 

1421
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,549
and on the other hand we're given a
single integer t

1422
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559

 

1423
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,190

and what turns out to be right is to use

1424
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
and what turns out to be right is to use
 

1425
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,830
and what turns out to be right is to use
prefix

1426
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
prefix
 

1427
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,510
prefix
prefixes or suffixes on this

1428
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
prefixes or suffixes on this
 

1429
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,789
prefixes or suffixes on this
sequence and uh integers less than or

1430
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
sequence and uh integers less than or
 

1431
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,630
sequence and uh integers less than or
equal to t

1432
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
equal to t
 

1433
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:38,789
equal to t
let's think about why

1434
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:38,799

 

1435
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,190

so that was sort bot for rod cutting

1436
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
so that was sort bot for rod cutting
 

1437
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,230
so that was sort bot for rod cutting
this is swordbot

1438
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
this is swordbot
 

1439
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,510
this is swordbot
for subset sum

1440
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520

 

1441
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,549

again i'll look for a look ahead to

1442
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559
again i'll look for a look ahead to
 

1443
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,190
again i'll look for a look ahead to
what feature of the solution should i

1444
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
what feature of the solution should i
 

1445
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,389
what feature of the solution should i
guess

1446
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:58,399
guess
 

1447
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,510
guess
well i have these n numbers each of them

1448
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:01,520
well i have these n numbers each of them
 

1449
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,549
well i have these n numbers each of them
could be

1450
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
could be
 

1451
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,870
could be
in my subset or not so i have this

1452
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
in my subset or not so i have this
 

1453
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,549
in my subset or not so i have this
binary choice for each ai

1454
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:06,559
binary choice for each ai
 

1455
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,830
binary choice for each ai
is it in s or not

1456
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,840

 

1457
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,269

that's a lot of questions to answer i

1458
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
that's a lot of questions to answer i
 

1459
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,710
that's a lot of questions to answer i
can't answer them answer them all at

1460
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
can't answer them answer them all at
 

1461
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,470
can't answer them answer them all at
once but i could just start with

1462
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
once but i could just start with
 

1463
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,789
once but i could just start with
the first one and say well is a 0 an s

1464
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
the first one and say well is a 0 an s
 

1465
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,830
the first one and say well is a 0 an s
yes or no

1466
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
yes or no
 

1467
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,950
yes or no
there's two answers locally brute force

1468
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960
there's two answers locally brute force
 

1469
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,070
there's two answers locally brute force
if i do that what happens to my

1470
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
if i do that what happens to my
 

1471
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,070
if i do that what happens to my
problem what new sub problems do i run

1472
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
problem what new sub problems do i run
 

1473
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,230
problem what new sub problems do i run
into what do i want to recurse on well

1474
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,240
into what do i want to recurse on well
 

1475
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,389
into what do i want to recurse on well
i've eliminated a zero that will leave a

1476
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
i've eliminated a zero that will leave a
 

1477
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,310
i've eliminated a zero that will leave a
suffix of the ai's

1478
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320
suffix of the ai's
 

1479
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,549
suffix of the ai's
so suffixes on capital a seem like a

1480
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:34,559
so suffixes on capital a seem like a
 

1481
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,950
so suffixes on capital a seem like a
good idea

1482
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:36,960
good idea
 

1483
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,630
good idea
and what about my target sum well it

1484
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
and what about my target sum well it
 

1485
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,990
and what about my target sum well it
depends if i

1486
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
depends if i
 

1487
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,590
depends if i
put a zero in my set s

1488
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
put a zero in my set s
 

1489
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,029
put a zero in my set s
then the target sum for the remainder is

1490
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:47,039
then the target sum for the remainder is
 

1491
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,710
then the target sum for the remainder is
t minus a0 so t went down

1492
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:50,720
t minus a0 so t went down
 

1493
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,789
t minus a0 so t went down
and so i need i need in my sub problems

1494
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
and so i need i need in my sub problems
 

1495
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,909
and so i need i need in my sub problems
to represent smaller target sums also

1496
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
to represent smaller target sums also
 

1497
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,510
to represent smaller target sums also
so this is how you figure out what sub

1498
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,520
so this is how you figure out what sub
 

1499
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,430
so this is how you figure out what sub
problems you should use don't you

1500
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
problems you should use don't you
 

1501
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,830
problems you should use don't you
i mean you could just try prefixes on

1502
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,840
i mean you could just try prefixes on
 

1503
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,470
i mean you could just try prefixes on
this

1504
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
this
 

1505
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,950
this
suffixes on this substrings on this and

1506
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
suffixes on this substrings on this and
 

1507
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,389
suffixes on this substrings on this and
yes or no do i include

1508
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
yes or no do i include
 

1509
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,310
yes or no do i include
smaller versions of t here but you can

1510
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
smaller versions of t here but you can
 

1511
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,430
smaller versions of t here but you can
also just think about

1512
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
also just think about
 

1513
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,190
also just think about
try to write a recurrence relation first

1514
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
try to write a recurrence relation first
 

1515
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,950
try to write a recurrence relation first
see what things you are

1516
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
see what things you are
 

1517
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,750
see what things you are
naturally recursing on and then

1518
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
naturally recursing on and then
 

1519
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,350
naturally recursing on and then
formulate the sub problems that way

1520
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,360
formulate the sub problems that way
 

1521
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,070
formulate the sub problems that way
so that's what i like to do

1522
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,080

 

1523
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,430

so i'm going to have a sub problem for

1524
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
so i'm going to have a sub problem for
 

1525
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,830
so i'm going to have a sub problem for
each suffix

1526
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:27,840
each suffix
 

1527
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,870
each suffix
uh so that's x of i

1528
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
uh so that's x of i
 

1529
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,029
uh so that's x of i
and for each target sum and i use these

1530
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:33,039
and for each target sum and i use these
 

1531
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,230
and for each target sum and i use these
capital letters

1532
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
capital letters
 

1533
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,149
capital letters
for the for the actual target sum so

1534
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:36,159
for the for the actual target sum so
 

1535
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,230
for the for the actual target sum so
that i can use lowercase letters for

1536
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
that i can use lowercase letters for
 

1537
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,510
that i can use lowercase letters for
smaller versions of them so this is

1538
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
smaller versions of them so this is
 

1539
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,950
smaller versions of them so this is
going to be

1540
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
going to be
 

1541
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,870
going to be
uh does any subset

1542
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:46,880

 

1543
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,110

remember don't first most important

1544
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,120
remember don't first most important
 

1545
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,990
remember don't first most important
thing is to define

1546
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
thing is to define
 

1547
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,909
thing is to define
what your sub problems are don't just

1548
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:51,919
what your sub problems are don't just
 

1549
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,669
what your sub problems are don't just
say it's the same problem but where i

1550
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
say it's the same problem but where i
 

1551
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,029
say it's the same problem but where i
replace blah blah blah

1552
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
replace blah blah blah
 

1553
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,149
replace blah blah blah
very it can be very ambiguous and so

1554
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,159
very it can be very ambiguous and so
 

1555
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,350
very it can be very ambiguous and so
uh does any subset s of

1556
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,360
uh does any subset s of
 

1557
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,549
uh does any subset s of
the suffix a from i onwards

1558
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559

 

1559
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,789

some to little t

1560
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:10,799

 

1561
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,470

and we're going to have this sub problem

1562
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,480
and we're going to have this sub problem
 

1563
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,990
and we're going to have this sub problem
the other important thing is to

1564
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
the other important thing is to
 

1565
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,590
the other important thing is to
say how many sub problems there are and

1566
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
say how many sub problems there are and
 

1567
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,509
say how many sub problems there are and
what your

1568
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
what your
 

1569
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,870
what your
indices can vary over so i

1570
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,880
indices can vary over so i
 

1571
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,909
indices can vary over so i
is going to be between

1572
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:23,919
is going to be between
 

1573
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,110
is going to be between
0 and

1574
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
0 and
 

1575
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,630
0 and
n and t is going to be between 0

1576
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
n and t is going to be between 0
 

1577
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,149
n and t is going to be between 0
and big t

1578
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159

 

1579
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,710

okay so number of sub problems is n plus

1580
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
okay so number of sub problems is n plus
 

1581
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,710
okay so number of sub problems is n plus
one times t plus one or theta

1582
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,720
one times t plus one or theta
 

1583
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,830
one times t plus one or theta
n times t cool now i claim i can write a

1584
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:44,840
n times t cool now i claim i can write a
 

1585
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,310
n times t cool now i claim i can write a
relation

1586
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
relation
 

1587
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,190
relation
like i said by so we have this suffix

1588
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,200
like i said by so we have this suffix
 

1589
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,870
like i said by so we have this suffix
from a

1590
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
from a
 

1591
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,149
from a
from i onwards in a and so i'm just

1592
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159
from i onwards in a and so i'm just
 

1593
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,350
from i onwards in a and so i'm just
going to

1594
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
going to
 

1595
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,029
going to
because i'm looking at suffixes i want

1596
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
because i'm looking at suffixes i want
 

1597
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,950
because i'm looking at suffixes i want
to keep with suffixes so i should try to

1598
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
to keep with suffixes so i should try to
 

1599
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,789
to keep with suffixes so i should try to
guess what happens to a of i

1600
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
guess what happens to a of i
 

1601
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,549
guess what happens to a of i
because then what will remain is a of i

1602
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
because then what will remain is a of i
 

1603
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,310
because then what will remain is a of i
plus 1 onwards

1604
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
plus 1 onwards
 

1605
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,549
plus 1 onwards
and a of i can either be in my subset s

1606
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:06,559
and a of i can either be in my subset s
 

1607
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,710
and a of i can either be in my subset s
or not so there's two choices

1608
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
or not so there's two choices
 

1609
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,310
or not so there's two choices
so x of i t is going to be

1610
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,320
so x of i t is going to be
 

1611
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,870
so x of i t is going to be
involve two things so there's an

1612
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
involve two things so there's an
 

1613
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,149
involve two things so there's an
operator here

1614
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:16,159
operator here
 

1615
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,430
operator here
and then i have a set of two items which

1616
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:19,440
and then i have a set of two items which
 

1617
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,710
and then i have a set of two items which
is

1618
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
is
 

1619
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,070
is
uh i could choose to not

1620
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
uh i could choose to not
 

1621
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,990
uh i could choose to not
put a of i in my subset in that case

1622
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
put a of i in my subset in that case
 

1623
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,070
put a of i in my subset in that case
i've eliminated a of i and what remains

1624
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
i've eliminated a of i and what remains
 

1625
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,190
i've eliminated a of i and what remains
is uh

1626
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
is uh
 

1627
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,990
is uh
a of i plus 1 onwards and i didn't

1628
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,000
a of i plus 1 onwards and i didn't
 

1629
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,509
a of i plus 1 onwards and i didn't
change my target sum i

1630
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
change my target sum i
 

1631
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,269
change my target sum i
i haven't put anything in s so i still

1632
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:37,279
i haven't put anything in s so i still
 

1633
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,190
i haven't put anything in s so i still
want to achieve the same sum

1634
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200
want to achieve the same sum
 

1635
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,630
want to achieve the same sum
so this is the case where a

1636
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:42,640
so this is the case where a
 

1637
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,909
so this is the case where a
i is not in s

1638
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
i is not in s
 

1639
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,509
i is not in s
and then the other case is

1640
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519

 

1641
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,549

i put a of i in s

1642
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559
i put a of i in s
 

1643
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,389
i put a of i in s
in that case again i've eliminated a of

1644
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
in that case again i've eliminated a of
 

1645
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,230
in that case again i've eliminated a of
i and so what remains to figure out is

1646
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,240
i and so what remains to figure out is
 

1647
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,430
i and so what remains to figure out is
what happens to

1648
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440
what happens to
 

1649
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,630
what happens to
a of i plus 1 onwards but now my target

1650
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
a of i plus 1 onwards but now my target
 

1651
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,149
a of i plus 1 onwards but now my target
sum is different because

1652
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
sum is different because
 

1653
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,389
sum is different because
i put a number in my set and so among

1654
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
i put a number in my set and so among
 

1655
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,509
i put a number in my set and so among
these items

1656
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
these items
 

1657
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,750
these items
they should sum up to not little t

1658
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760
they should sum up to not little t
 

1659
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,870
they should sum up to not little t
anymore but now

1660
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
anymore but now
 

1661
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,750
anymore but now
little t minus what i just added which

1662
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
little t minus what i just added which
 

1663
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,470
little t minus what i just added which
is

1664
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:12,480
is
 

1665
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,269
is
a i so then if if in this sub problem i

1666
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,279
a i so then if if in this sub problem i
 

1667
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,950
a i so then if if in this sub problem i
get something that sums to t

1668
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:16,960
get something that sums to t
 

1669
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,750
get something that sums to t
minus a i and then i add a i to that set

1670
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:19,760
minus a i and then i add a i to that set
 

1671
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,950
minus a i and then i add a i to that set
i will get something that sums to

1672
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:20,960
i will get something that sums to
 

1673
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,909
i will get something that sums to
exactly t

1674
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
exactly t
 

1675
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,990
exactly t
and so that's a valid solution to this

1676
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
and so that's a valid solution to this
 

1677
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,269
and so that's a valid solution to this
problem

1678
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
problem
 

1679
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,710
problem
and because we have brute forced

1680
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
and because we have brute forced
 

1681
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,669
and because we have brute forced
all possibilities there were only two uh

1682
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:31,679
all possibilities there were only two uh
 

1683
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,310
all possibilities there were only two uh
if we

1684
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,320
if we
 

1685
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,389
if we
combine these in the suitable way then

1686
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:34,399
combine these in the suitable way then
 

1687
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,590
combine these in the suitable way then
we will

1688
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:35,600
we will
 

1689
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,750
we will
have considered all options

1690
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
have considered all options
 

1691
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,310
have considered all options
now what do we want here so this is

1692
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,320
now what do we want here so this is
 

1693
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,389
now what do we want here so this is
normally i'd write max or min

1694
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:44,399
normally i'd write max or min
 

1695
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,669
normally i'd write max or min
but this is a decision problem the

1696
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
but this is a decision problem the
 

1697
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,750
but this is a decision problem the
output is just yes or no so this is a

1698
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
output is just yes or no so this is a
 

1699
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,430
output is just yes or no so this is a
yes or no answer this is a yes or no

1700
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
yes or no answer this is a yes or no
 

1701
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,350
yes or no answer this is a yes or no
answer this is a yes or no answer

1702
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
answer this is a yes or no answer
 

1703
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,350
answer this is a yes or no answer
and so what i want is or

1704
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360

 

1705
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,470

in python this would be called any just

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
that sums to t then the answer to this
 

1715
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,829
that sums to t then the answer to this
is yes

1716
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:09,839
is yes
 

1717
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,869

and the this time analysis rule

1802
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:33,359
and the this time analysis rule
 

1803
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,710
and the this time analysis rule
that we only have to sum over sub

1804
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
that we only have to sum over sub
 

1805
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,150
that we only have to sum over sub
problems because we only compute each

1806

problems because we only compute each
 

1807
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,150

sub problem once

1808
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
sub problem once
 

1809
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,390

so without memoization this would take

1810
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:40,400
so without memoization this would take
 

1811
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,470
so without memoization this would take
exponential time just like fibonacci

1812
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:42,480
exponential time just like fibonacci
 

1813
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,030

with memorization magic i just think

this is

this is
 

1817
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,990
this is
beautiful so even though it's one of our

dps i think it's an impressive one

1822
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,640

 

1823
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,829

okay uh topological order well let's

1824
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:57,839
okay uh topological order well let's
 

1825
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,550
okay uh topological order well let's
look at these function calls so here we

1826
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,560
look at these function calls so here we
 

1827
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,550
look at these function calls so here we
have to be a little bit careful

1828
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,560
have to be a little bit careful
 

1829
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,829
have to be a little bit careful

00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
because
 

1843
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,030
because
sometimes i call with the same value of

1844
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,040
sometimes i call with the same value of
 

1845
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,230
sometimes i call with the same value of
t

1846
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,240
t
 

1847
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,109
t
and i don't want to get into i want to

1848
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:23,119
and i don't want to get into i want to
 

1849
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,390
and i don't want to get into i want to
ensure that this has already been

1850
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:24,400
ensure that this has already been
 

1851
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,710
ensure that this has already been
computed when i try to compute this

1852
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:26,720
computed when i try to compute this
 

1853
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,630
computed when i try to compute this
so i is the right thing and we should

1854
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
so i is the right thing and we should
 

1855
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,670
so i is the right thing and we should
say decreasing i

1856
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
say decreasing i
 

1857
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,349
say decreasing i
it doesn't actually matter how we order

1858
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:33,359
it doesn't actually matter how we order
 

1859
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,870
it doesn't actually matter how we order
with respect to

1860
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
with respect to
 

1861
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,470
with respect to
t just any order that is decreasing

1862
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:38,480
t just any order that is decreasing
 

1863
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,030
t just any order that is decreasing
i will be good because these function

1864
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
i will be good because these function
 

1865
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,790
i will be good because these function
calls always increase i

1866
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800

 

1867
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,270

okay we need a base case

1868
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280

 

1869
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,310

base cases let's see

1870
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,320
base cases let's see
 

1871
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,510
base cases let's see
the natural given this aspect i think

1872
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
the natural given this aspect i think
 

1873
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,270
the natural given this aspect i think
the natural thing is to have a base case

1874
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280
the natural thing is to have a base case
 

1875
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,990
the natural thing is to have a base case
when

1876
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,000
when
 

1877
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,190
when
my suffix is empty which is when i

1878
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
my suffix is empty which is when i
 

1879
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,550
my suffix is empty which is when i
equals n so this is x

1880
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:05,560
equals n so this is x
 

1881
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,230
equals n so this is x
of uh

1882
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,240
of uh
 

1883
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,589
of uh
n comma t for any

1884
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
n comma t for any
 

1885
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,230
n comma t for any
little t because we don't have a lot of

1886
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
little t because we don't have a lot of
 

1887
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,109
little t because we don't have a lot of
control of how t

1888
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
control of how t
 

1889
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,390
control of how t
is changing but this is easy so this is

1890
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:18,400
is changing but this is easy so this is
 

1891
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,870
is changing but this is easy so this is
saying if i give you no numbers

1892
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:20,880
saying if i give you no numbers
 

1893
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,589
saying if i give you no numbers
what sums can you represent the only sum

1894
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:23,599
what sums can you represent the only sum
 

1895
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,630
what sums can you represent the only sum
i can represent is

1896
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
i can represent is
 

1897
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,829
i can represent is
0. okay so

1898
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
0. okay so
 

1899
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,829
0. okay so
if t equals 0

1900
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:31,839
if t equals 0
 

1901
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,950
if t equals 0
then the answer is yes and

1902
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:34,960
then the answer is yes and
 

1903
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,109
then the answer is yes and
otherwise the answer is no

1904
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119

 

1905
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,030

so that's my base case and that's enough

1906
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,040
so that's my base case and that's enough
 

1907
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,630
so that's my base case and that's enough
and we needed this base case because if

1908
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
and we needed this base case because if
 

1909
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,390
and we needed this base case because if
we wrote x of n comma t this would try

1910
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:46,400
we wrote x of n comma t this would try
 

1911
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,390
we wrote x of n comma t this would try
to call x of n plus 1 which doesn't make

1912
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
to call x of n plus 1 which doesn't make
 

1913
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,190
to call x of n plus 1 which doesn't make
sense

1914
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
sense
 

1915
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,270
sense
but x of n call in as a natural

1916
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,280
but x of n call in as a natural
 

1917
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,589
but x of n call in as a natural
suffix which we only allowed i to go up

1918
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:55,599
suffix which we only allowed i to go up
 

1919
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,829
suffix which we only allowed i to go up
to n and that's the empty suffix

1920
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
to n and that's the empty suffix
 

1921
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,030
to n and that's the empty suffix
so this is enough we need the

1922
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,040
so this is enough we need the
 

1923
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,829
so this is enough we need the
original problem

1924
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:07,839

 

1925
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,349

uh which is the entire string from zero

1926
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:11,359
uh which is the entire string from zero
 

1927
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,310
uh which is the entire string from zero
onwards

1928
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,320
onwards
 

1929
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,270
onwards
and capital t for little t that's our

1930
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280
and capital t for little t that's our
 

1931
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,390
and capital t for little t that's our
target sum

1932
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,400
target sum
 

1933
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,150
target sum
and then the running time

1934
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160

 

1935
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,390

as i said there are n times t sub

1936
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,400
as i said there are n times t sub
 

1937
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,870
as i said there are n times t sub
problems

1938
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:24,880
problems
 

1939
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,829
problems
theta and the amount of work we spend

1940
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:27,839
theta and the amount of work we spend
 

1941
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,750
theta and the amount of work we spend
for each one that isn't recursion is

1942
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:29,760
for each one that isn't recursion is
 

1943
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,069
for each one that isn't recursion is
constant we just do a couple

1944
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:32,079
constant we just do a couple
 

1945
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,589
constant we just do a couple
subtractions additions

1946
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
subtractions additions
 

1947
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,550
subtractions additions
do an or and recursive calls so constant

1948
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:36,560
do an or and recursive calls so constant
 

1949
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,270
do an or and recursive calls so constant
time

1950
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
time
 

1951
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,710
time
so n times t is the running time

1952
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:40,720
so n times t is the running time
 

1953
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,270
so n times t is the running time
of this algorithm let me

1954
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,280

 

1955
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,790

show you an example as a subproblem tag

1956
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:50,800

 

1957
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,790

really helpful to see how these are hard

1958
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800
really helpful to see how these are hard
 

1959
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,069
really helpful to see how these are hard
to draw but they're easy to read

1960
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:56,079
to draw but they're easy to read
 

1961
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,349
to draw but they're easy to read
i think they're helpful to show what's

1962
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359
i think they're helpful to show what's
 

1963
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,109
i think they're helpful to show what's
really going on in this dp

this remember every node here

1966
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
this remember every node here

this remember every node here
corresponds to a possible subproblem we

1968
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:02,480
corresponds to a possible subproblem we
 

1969
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,589
corresponds to a possible subproblem we
could have so we have

1970
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
could have so we have
 

1971
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,750
could have so we have
the choices for little t on the top the

1972
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
the choices for little t on the top the
 

1973

on the left so the original problem we

1976
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,440
on the left so the original problem we
 

1977
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,670
on the left so the original problem we
care about is i equals 0

1978

1987
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,470

different example sorry my new set a
 

1989
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,069

this is definitely possible i can add

1994
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,320
this is definitely possible i can add
 

1995
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,589
this is definitely possible i can add

this shows that a doesn't have to be

1998
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,280
this shows that a doesn't have to be
 

1999
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,630
this shows that a doesn't have to be

here for yes it is possible and how did

2008
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:42,640
here for yes it is possible and how did
 

2009
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,670
here for yes it is possible and how did
i compute that

2010
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
i compute that
 

2011
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,430
i compute that
well i just drew a bunch of arrows

2012
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
well i just drew a bunch of arrows
 

2013
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,630
well i just drew a bunch of arrows
so there's vertical arrows here always

2014
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
so there's vertical arrows here always
 

2015
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,150
so there's vertical arrows here always
going from each problem to the next one

2016
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
going from each problem to the next one
 

2017
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,829
going from each problem to the next one
above it because

2018
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
above it because
 

2019
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,109
above it because
we have this dependency x i of t

2020
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
we have this dependency x i of t
 

2021
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,390
we have this dependency x i of t
calls x of i plus 1 comma t

2022
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,400
calls x of i plus 1 comma t
 

2023
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,510
calls x of i plus 1 comma t
so that's

2024
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,520

 

2025
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,190

the calls are going in this direction so

2026
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
the calls are going in this direction so
 

2027
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,470
the calls are going in this direction so
the dependency order is you have to

2028
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
the dependency order is you have to
 

2029
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,910
the dependency order is you have to
compute things lower down

2030
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920
compute things lower down
 

2031
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,270
compute things lower down
before you compute things up here

2032
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:11,280
before you compute things up here
 

2033
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,309
before you compute things up here
um and indeed down here is the base case

2034
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
um and indeed down here is the base case
 

2035
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,630
um and indeed down here is the base case
where we write yes for the first problem

2036
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
where we write yes for the first problem
 

2037
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,990
where we write yes for the first problem
and no for all the others because we

2038
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,000
and no for all the others because we
 

2039
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,109
and no for all the others because we
don't have any numbers we can't

2040
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
don't have any numbers we can't
 

2041
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,630
don't have any numbers we can't
represent anything above

2042
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
represent anything above
 

2043
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,750
represent anything above
zero okay and then we have these blue

2044
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
zero okay and then we have these blue
 

2045
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,309
zero okay and then we have these blue
lines

2046
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319

2047
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,670

i just drew them a different color so

2048
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
i just drew them a different color so
 

2049
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,670
i just drew them a different color so
they stand out

2050
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:27,680
they stand out
 

2051
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,390
they stand out
hopefully and they correspond to the

2052
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400
hopefully and they correspond to the
 

2053
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,190
hopefully and they correspond to the

2054
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200
numbers here
 

2055
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,150
numbers here
so our first choice is do we include a

2056
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,160
so our first choice is do we include a
 

2057
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,349
so our first choice is do we include a
zero which is

2058
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:35,359
zero which is
 

2059
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,190
zero which is
three so that's only possible if we're

2060
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
three so that's only possible if we're
 

2061
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,630
three so that's only possible if we're
trying to represent a number

2062
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
trying to represent a number
 

2063
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,309
trying to represent a number
uh that's greater than or equal to three

2064
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:42,319
uh that's greater than or equal to three
 

2065
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,109
uh that's greater than or equal to three

those are the same so this notation

2076
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:05,760
those are the same so this notation
 

2077
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,390
those are the same so this notation
means

2078
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
means
 

2079
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,550
means
i put this item in this set that we take

00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
i put this item in this set that we take
 

2081
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,589
i put this item in this set that we take

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,510
only if this condition holds okay
otherwise i admit it because it's not a

00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,520
otherwise i admit it because it's not a
 

2087
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,230
otherwise i admit it because it's not a

2088
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,240
choice
 

2089
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,910
choice
why is that important because i don't

2090
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:15,920
why is that important because i don't
 

2091
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,430
why is that important because i don't
want to call x on a negative value of t

2092
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:19,440
want to call x on a negative value of t
 

2093
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,069
want to call x on a negative value of t
we only are allowed to call x here when

2094
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
we only are allowed to call x here when
 

2095
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,470
we only are allowed to call x here when
t is between zero and capital t

2096
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
t is between zero and capital t
 

2097
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,030
t is between zero and capital t
so that's subtlety but important for a

2098
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
so that's subtlety but important for a
 

2099
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,510
so that's subtlety but important for a
correct

2100
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,520
correct
 

2101
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,710
correct
dp

2102
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720

 

2103
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,710

so then that's why there's no edge from

2104
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720
so then that's why there's no edge from
 

2105
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,309
so then that's why there's no edge from
here for example that goes three to the

2106
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:34,319
here for example that goes three to the
 

2107
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,349
here for example that goes three to the
left because there's no

2108
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359
left because there's no
 

2109
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,510
left because there's no
vertex there there's no sub problem so

2110
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
vertex there there's no sub problem so
 

2111
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,390
vertex there there's no sub problem so
only for

2112
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
only for
 

2113
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,750
only for
uh little t from three onwards we have

2114
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
uh little t from three onwards we have
 

2115
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,589
uh little t from three onwards we have
this edge that goes three back

2116
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:43,599
this edge that goes three back
 

2117
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,030
this edge that goes three back
and that's just the same pattern over

2118
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
and that's just the same pattern over
 

2119
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,190
and that's just the same pattern over
and over then our next number is four

2120
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
and over then our next number is four
 

2121
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,030
and over then our next number is four
and so we have these edges that are go

2122
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
and so we have these edges that are go
 

2123
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,470
and so we have these edges that are go
four to the right

2124
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:50,480
four to the right
 

2125
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,750
four to the right
then our next number is three so we

2126
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
then our next number is three so we
 

2127
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,109
then our next number is three so we
again have edges that go three to the

2128
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,119
again have edges that go three to the
 

2129
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:53,670
again have edges that go three to the
right

2130
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
right
 

2131
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,349
right
and then our next number is one so we

2132
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:55,359
and then our next number is one so we
 

2133
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,190
and then our next number is one so we
have these nice diagonal edges that go

2134
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
have these nice diagonal edges that go
 

2135
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,349
have these nice diagonal edges that go
one to the right and then what's

2136
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
one to the right and then what's
 

2137
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,150
one to the right and then what's
happening in here at each stage let's

2138
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,160
happening in here at each stage let's
 

2139
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,430
happening in here at each stage let's
take an interesting one maybe this

2140
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
take an interesting one maybe this
 

2141
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,710
take an interesting one maybe this
vertex

2142
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:04,720
vertex
 

2143
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,230
vertex
is we look at each of the incoming

2144
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
is we look at each of the incoming
 

2145
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,710
is we look at each of the incoming
neighbors and we take the or

2146
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:08,720
neighbors and we take the or
 

2147
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,589
neighbors and we take the or
so the incoming neighbor here has a no

2148
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:11,599
so the incoming neighbor here has a no
 

2149
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,750
so the incoming neighbor here has a no
incoming neighbor here has a yes

2150
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:13,760
incoming neighbor here has a yes
 

2151
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,510
incoming neighbor here has a yes
and so we write a yes here which means

2152
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
and so we write a yes here which means
 

2153
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,990
and so we write a yes here which means
that given just these numbers three and

2154
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,000
that given just these numbers three and
 

2155
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,109
that given just these numbers three and
one

2156
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
one
 

2157
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,510
one
we can represent the number three namely

2158
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,520
we can represent the number three namely
 

2159
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,750
we can represent the number three namely
by taking this edge

2160
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
by taking this edge
 

2161
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,190
by taking this edge
of weight three sorry of length

2162
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
of weight three sorry of length
 

2163
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,030
of weight three sorry of length
three and then just going straight down

2164
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
three and then just going straight down
 

2165
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,390
three and then just going straight down
to a base case

2166
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:30,400
to a base case
 

2167
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,670
to a base case
that's yes that's representing 0. so in

2168
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:33,680
that's yes that's representing 0. so in
 

2169
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,870
that's yes that's representing 0. so in
this case we

2170
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:34,880
this case we
 

2171
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,390
this case we
this example i didn't draw the parent

2172
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
this example i didn't draw the parent
 

2173
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,550
this example i didn't draw the parent
pointers here but they're in the notes

2174
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560

this yes is possible not from going this

2176
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:41,760
this yes is possible not from going this
 

2177
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,190
this yes is possible not from going this
way but from going this way

2178
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200

so we take the number three then we go

2180
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
so we take the number three then we go
 

2181
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,990
so we take the number three then we go
down which means we skip the number

2182
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,000
down which means we skip the number
 

2183
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,589
down which means we skip the number
four and then we go left which means we

2184
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:51,599
four and then we go left which means we
 

2185
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,870
four and then we go left which means we
take the number three and then we go

2186
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880
take the number three and then we go
 

2187
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,510
take the number three and then we go
down which means we skip the number one

2188
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:55,520
down which means we skip the number one
 

2189
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,510
down which means we skip the number one
okay so we can represent six as three

2190
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:57,520
okay so we can represent six as three
 

2191
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,349
okay so we can represent six as three
plus three

2192
00:42:59,349 --> 00:42:59,359
plus three
 

2193
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,309
plus three
cool so subset sum not only can we solve

2194
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:02,319
cool so subset sum not only can we solve
 

2195
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,750
cool so subset sum not only can we solve
the decision problem but by following

2196
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:03,760
the decision problem but by following
 

2197
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,750
the decision problem but by following
parent pointers in the yes instances

2198
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
parent pointers in the yes instances
 

2199
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,670
parent pointers in the yes instances
we can actually find a valid subset

2200
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:07,680
we can actually find a valid subset
 

2201
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,750
we can actually find a valid subset
question you added that condition to the

2202
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:09,760
question you added that condition to the
 

2203
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,349
question you added that condition to the
relation

2204
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:15,359

 

2205
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,950

good question um so ins

uh it's it's a generally useful

2208
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
uh it's it's a generally useful
 

2209
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,030
uh it's it's a generally useful
technique to add

2210
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
technique to add

they apply

2214
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
they apply
 

2215
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,829
they apply
you can write a lot of dps that way and

2216
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
you can write a lot of dps that way and
 

2217
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,829
you can write a lot of dps that way and
that's why i wanted to stress it

2218
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:29,839
that's why i wanted to stress it
 

2219
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,309
that's why i wanted to stress it
you could instead of adding this

2220
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:32,319
you could instead of adding this
 

2221
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:32,870
you could instead of adding this
condition

2222
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880

allow the case that little t is negative

2224
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
allow the case that little t is negative
 

2225
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,030
allow the case that little t is negative
but you have to think about how negative

2226
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
but you have to think about how negative
 

2227
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,710
but you have to think about how negative
would it be

2228
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:38,720
would it be
 

2229
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,109
would it be
you might say well maybe t between minus

2230
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:41,119
you might say well maybe t between minus
 

2231
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:41,829
you might say well maybe t between minus
big t

2232
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:41,839
big t
 

2233
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,670
big t
and plus big t is enough i don't think

2234
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
and plus big t is enough i don't think
 

2235
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,510
and plus big t is enough i don't think
so it should be

2236
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:45,520
so it should be
 

2237
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,270
so it should be
um we're at some value t and we subtract

2238
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:49,280
um we're at some value t and we subtract
 

2239
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,829
um we're at some value t and we subtract
some ai we don't know how the ai's

2240
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
some ai we don't know how the ai's
 

2241
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,150
some ai we don't know how the ai's
compared to big t

2242
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,160
compared to big t
 

2243
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,430
compared to big t
probably they're less than or equal to

2244
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:55,440
probably they're less than or equal to
 

2245
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,190
probably they're less than or equal to
big t because they're not useful if

2246
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,200
big t because they're not useful if
 

2247
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,630
big t because they're not useful if
they're bigger than big t so you could

2248
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:58,640
they're bigger than big t so you could
 

2249
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,390
they're bigger than big t so you could
first prune the ais to guarantee all the

2250
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
first prune the ais to guarantee all the
 

2251
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,910
first prune the ais to guarantee all the
ais are less than big t

2252
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
ais are less than big t
 

2253
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,630
ais are less than big t
then minus big t to big t would work

2254
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:04,640
then minus big t to big t would work
 

2255
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,349
then minus big t to big t would work
otherwise it's like minus the maximum ai

2256
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:07,359
otherwise it's like minus the maximum ai
 

2257
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,710
otherwise it's like minus the maximum ai
up to big t would be enough i think

2258
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:10,720
up to big t would be enough i think
 

2259
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,109
up to big t would be enough i think
yeah does this restrict to only the

2260
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
yeah does this restrict to only the
 

2261
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,430
yeah does this restrict to only the
positive integers in the input

2262
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
positive integers in the input
 

2263
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,190
positive integers in the input
ah do i i am implicitly assuming here

2264
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
ah do i i am implicitly assuming here
 

2265
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,390
ah do i i am implicitly assuming here
that all the ai's are positive

2266
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:22,400
that all the ai's are positive
 

2267
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,150
that all the ai's are positive
uh i think you can solve it with

2268
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,160
uh i think you can solve it with
 

2269
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,390
uh i think you can solve it with
negative numbers but it's not

2270
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:26,400
negative numbers but it's not
 

2271
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,230
negative numbers but it's not
uh and maybe we'll do it in recitation

2272
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,240
uh and maybe we'll do it in recitation
 

2273
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,430
uh and maybe we'll do it in recitation
it is not as

2274
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:29,440
it is not as
 

2275
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,910
it is not as
it's not a trivial change to this dp

2276
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
it's not a trivial change to this dp
 

2277
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,670
it's not a trivial change to this dp
i've definitely thought about it before

2278
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:33,680
i've definitely thought about it before
 

2279
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,710
i've definitely thought about it before
yeah so i should have said positive

2280
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
yeah so i should have said positive
 

2281
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,510
yeah so i should have said positive
integers

2282
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:39,520

 

2283
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,230

thank you

2284
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:44,240

 

2285
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,390

cool all right so uh that's subset sum

2286
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
cool all right so uh that's subset sum
 

2287
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,710
cool all right so uh that's subset sum
but we come back to this question of is

2288
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,720
but we come back to this question of is
 

2289
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,630
but we come back to this question of is
this a good algorithm is it polynomial

2290
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,640
this a good algorithm is it polynomial
 

2291
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,150
this a good algorithm is it polynomial
time

2292
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:54,160
time
 

2293
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,790
time
so we have this running time n times t

2294
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:56,800
so we have this running time n times t
 

2295
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,750
so we have this running time n times t
so a new question

2296
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,760
so a new question
 

2297
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,829
so a new question
is is n times big t

2298
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:02,839

 

2299
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,710

polynomial

2300
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:08,720

 

2301
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,150

and the answer is no why

2302
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:12,160
and the answer is no why
 

2303
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,430
and the answer is no why
because for this problem what is the

2304
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,440
because for this problem what is the
 

2305
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,349
because for this problem what is the

how many words of input do i have
 

2309
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,230
how many words of input do i have
well i have these n integers and then i

2310
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:24,240
well i have these n integers and then i
 

2311
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,589
well i have these n integers and then i
also have the target sum

2312
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:25,599
also have the target sum
 

2313
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,550
also have the target sum
so similar to up above our input size is

2314
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
so similar to up above our input size is
 

2315
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,630
so similar to up above our input size is
n plus one

2316
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:30,640
n plus one
 

2317
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,710
n plus one
okay but now the labels really matter

2318
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:32,720
okay but now the labels really matter
 

2319
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,870
okay but now the labels really matter
before it was l plus one

00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:34,880
before it was l plus one
 

2321
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,349
before it was l plus one

00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,510

n plus one you cannot write that n n

2338
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:57,520
n plus one you cannot write that n n
 

2339
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,309
n plus one you cannot write that n n
times capital t is less than or equal to

2340
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:00,319
times capital t is less than or equal to
 

2341
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,390
times capital t is less than or equal to
n plus 1 to the 27th power

2342
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
n plus 1 to the 27th power
 

2343
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,150
n plus 1 to the 27th power
because you just don't know how n and t

2344
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,160
because you just don't know how n and t
 

2345
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,510
because you just don't know how n and t
relate

2346
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
relate
 

2347
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,430
relate
maybe t is at most n then we're happy

2348
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
maybe t is at most n then we're happy
 

2349
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,270
maybe t is at most n then we're happy
but maybe it's not maybe t

2350
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:09,280
but maybe it's not maybe t
 

2351
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,829
but maybe it's not maybe t
is 2 to the n why could it be 2 to the n

2352
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:12,839
is 2 to the n why could it be 2 to the n
 

2353
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,829
is 2 to the n why could it be 2 to the n
uh because

2354
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
uh because
 

2355
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,069
uh because
what do we know about capital t we

2356
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
what do we know about capital t we
 

2357
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:18,950
what do we know about capital t we
assume

2358
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
assume
 

2359
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,030
assume
implicitly throughout the course the t

2360
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:21,040
implicitly throughout the course the t
 

2361
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:21,990
implicitly throughout the course the t
fits in a word

2362
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,000
fits in a word
 

2363
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,109
fits in a word
that means it's a w bit number

2364
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:25,119
that means it's a w bit number
 

2365
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,230
that means it's a w bit number
so that means it's at most two to the w

2366
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,240
so that means it's at most two to the w
 

2367
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,910
so that means it's at most two to the w
and you might think well we know about a

2368
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920
and you might think well we know about a
 

2369
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,589
and you might think well we know about a
relation between w

2370
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:31,599
relation between w
 

2371
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,829
relation between w
and n so we know

2372
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:35,839
and n so we know
 

2373
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,030
and n so we know
t is at most 2 to the w

2374
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
t is at most 2 to the w
 

2375
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,030
t is at most 2 to the w
if it's w bits

00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,030

and we know that our assumption is

00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
and we know that our assumption is
 

2379
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,589
and we know that our assumption is
always that w is at least log n

always that w is at least log n

always that w is at least log n
that's the word ram trans-dichotomous

2382
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:49,359
that's the word ram trans-dichotomous

assumption
 

2385
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,710
assumption
but notice we don't know anything about

2386
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,720
but notice we don't know anything about
 

2387
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,390
but notice we don't know anything about
an upper bound on w

2388
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
an upper bound on w
 

2389
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,470
an upper bound on w
in order to upper bound t in terms of n

2390
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
in order to upper bound t in terms of n
 

2391
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,589
in order to upper bound t in terms of n
i'd need to say that w

2392
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599
i'd need to say that w
 

2393
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,109
i'd need to say that w
is at most log n then this would be at

2394
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
is at most log n then this would be at
 

2395
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,030
is at most log n then this would be at
most n and we'd be done but that's not

2396
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,040
most n and we'd be done but that's not
 

2397
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,910
most n and we'd be done but that's not
very interesting and generally we allow

2398
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920
very interesting and generally we allow
 

2399
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,990
very interesting and generally we allow
w to be arbitrarily large with respect

2400
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:06,000
w to be arbitrarily large with respect
 

2401
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,670
w to be arbitrarily large with respect
to log n it just has to be at least log

2402
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
to log n it just has to be at least log
 

2403
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:07,910
to log n it just has to be at least log
n

2404
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:07,920
n
 

2405
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,750
n
just to be able to index stuff

2406
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
just to be able to index stuff
 

2407
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,430
just to be able to index stuff
so but w could be really big

2408
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:15,440
so but w could be really big
 

2409
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,790
so but w could be really big
much bigger than log n for example

2410
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
much bigger than log n for example
 

2411
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,870
much bigger than log n for example
w equals n is not a crazy idea i mean

2412
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:22,880
w equals n is not a crazy idea i mean
 

2413
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,390
w equals n is not a crazy idea i mean
if if i have a machine that can

2414
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:24,400
if if i have a machine that can
 

2415
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,470
if if i have a machine that can
represent n numbers why not represent n

2416
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
represent n numbers why not represent n
 

2417
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,589
represent n numbers why not represent n
numbers each of which is

2418
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,599
numbers each of which is
 

2419
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,990
numbers each of which is
n bits long and maybe it takes a little

2420
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,000
n bits long and maybe it takes a little
 

2421
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,910
n bits long and maybe it takes a little
more time to compute on those

2422
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:31,920
more time to compute on those
 

2423
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,030
more time to compute on those
you might want to scale your running

2424
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040
you might want to scale your running
 

2425
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,309
you might want to scale your running
times but it's quite reasonable to think

2426
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
times but it's quite reasonable to think
 

2427
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,390
times but it's quite reasonable to think
about n-bit numbers

2428
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
about n-bit numbers
 

2429
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,829
about n-bit numbers
and then this is like n times 2 to the

2430
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:39,839
and then this is like n times 2 to the
 

2431
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,910
and then this is like n times 2 to the
n so this would actually be exponential

2432
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:41,920
n so this would actually be exponential
 

2433
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,270
n so this would actually be exponential
time

2434
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
time
 

2435
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,870
time
and if w is 2 to the n n times t

2436
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:46,880
and if w is 2 to the n n times t
 

2437
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,549
and if w is 2 to the n n times t
is exponential in the problem size

2438
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:52,559
is exponential in the problem size
 

2439
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,069
is exponential in the problem size
which is n plus 1. and that's just an

2440
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:56,079
which is n plus 1. and that's just an
 

2441
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:56,870
which is n plus 1. and that's just an
example

2442
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
example
 

2443
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,950
example
w could be bigger okay so this is not

2444
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:00,960
w could be bigger okay so this is not
 

2445
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,630
w could be bigger okay so this is not
what we call a polynomial algorithm or

2446
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
what we call a polynomial algorithm or
 

2447
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,309
what we call a polynomial algorithm or
strongly polynomial algorithm

2448
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
strongly polynomial algorithm
 

2449
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,309
strongly polynomial algorithm
but it's still pretty good right as long

2450
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:06,319
but it's still pretty good right as long
 

2451
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,390
but it's still pretty good right as long
as we know that capital t

2452
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,400
as we know that capital t
 

2453
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,109
as we know that capital t
is not ginormous then this is a great

2454
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:11,119
is not ginormous then this is a great
 

2455
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,870
is not ginormous then this is a great
algorithm

2456
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
algorithm
 

2457
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,910
algorithm
so it's and we capture that notion

2458
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:15,920
so it's and we capture that notion
 

2459
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:24,630
so it's and we capture that notion
with a concept called pseudo-polynomial

2460
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640

 

2461
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,990

it's not the best term but it's the

2462
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
it's not the best term but it's the
 

2463
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,750
it's not the best term but it's the
established term it's

2464
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:27,760
established term it's
 

2465
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,630
established term it's
like polynomial but not quite and the

2466
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,640
like polynomial but not quite and the
 

2467
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,630
like polynomial but not quite and the
definition of this term

2468
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,640
definition of this term
 

2469
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,069
definition of this term
so we have the definition of strongly

2470
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:34,079
so we have the definition of strongly
 

2471
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,230
so we have the definition of strongly
polynomial time uh now

2472
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:36,240
polynomial time uh now
 

2473
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,790
polynomial time uh now
uh pseudo-polynomial time this i'll

2474
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
uh pseudo-polynomial time this i'll
 

2475
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,150
uh pseudo-polynomial time this i'll
write time here

2476
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,160
write time here
 

2477
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,069
write time here
so you can measure other things

2478
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
so you can measure other things
 

2479
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,349
so you can measure other things
pseudopolynomial

2480
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
pseudopolynomial
 

2481
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:49,109
pseudopolynomial
uh is that we're polynomial

2482
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
uh is that we're polynomial
 

2483
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,470
uh is that we're polynomial
uh in the input size

2484
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
uh in the input size
 

2485
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,950
uh in the input size
just like before

2486
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:56,960

 

2487
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,950

and the input numbers

2488
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:00,960
and the input numbers
 

2489
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,750
and the input numbers
input integers

2490
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760

 

2491
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,030

okay so in this problem the input

2492
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:09,040
okay so in this problem the input
 

2493
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,390
okay so in this problem the input
integers are

2494
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:10,400
integers are
 

2495
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,630
integers are
capital t and a0 a1

2496
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,640
capital t and a0 a1
 

2497
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,910
capital t and a0 a1
up to a n minus 1. so we want now is a

2498
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:17,920
up to a n minus 1. so we want now is a
 

2499
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,750
up to a n minus 1. so we want now is a
polynomial or what some people call a

2500
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:19,760
polynomial or what some people call a
 

2501
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,589
polynomial or what some people call a
multinomial

2502
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:21,599
multinomial
 

2503
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,270
multinomial
where our variables are all of these

2504
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
where our variables are all of these
 

2505
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,309
where our variables are all of these
integers and we want to be polynomial

2506
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:26,319
integers and we want to be polynomial
 

2507
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,990
integers and we want to be polynomial
in them so we're allowed to take some

2508
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000
in them so we're allowed to take some
 

2509
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,750
in them so we're allowed to take some
constant power of capital t

2510
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,760
constant power of capital t
 

2511
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,910
constant power of capital t
and some constant number of the ais we

2512
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
and some constant number of the ais we
 

2513
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,190
and some constant number of the ais we
can't just take the product of all of

2514
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
can't just take the product of all of
 

2515
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,390
can't just take the product of all of
them that would be

2516
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,400
them that would be
 

2517
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,589
them that would be
big

2518
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:39,599

 

2519
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,069

so it's a i guess i should say constant

2520
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:42,079
so it's a i guess i should say constant
 

2521
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,390
so it's a i guess i should say constant
degree polynomial

2522
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400

 

2523
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,390

and indeed this is a you might call it a

2524
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:48,400
and indeed this is a you might call it a
 

2525
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,910
and indeed this is a you might call it a
quadratic polynomial

2526
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:49,920
quadratic polynomial
 

2527
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,950
quadratic polynomial
in the input size and the and one of the

2528
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960
in the input size and the and one of the
 

2529
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,230
in the input size and the and one of the
numbers

2530
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
numbers
 

2531
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,630
numbers
so this is this running time is pseudo

2532
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
so this is this running time is pseudo
 

2533
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,349
so this is this running time is pseudo
poly

2534
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
poly
 

2535
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:06,790
poly
but not poly

2536
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:06,800

 

2537
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,069

and so while normally we think of

2538
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:08,079
and so while normally we think of
 

2539
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,990
and so while normally we think of
polynomial time is good exponential time

2540
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,000
polynomial time is good exponential time
 

2541
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,910
polynomial time is good exponential time
is bad pseudo-polynomial is what we

2542
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:11,920
is bad pseudo-polynomial is what we
 

2543
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,630
is bad pseudo-polynomial is what we
normally call

2544
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:12,640
normally call
 

2545
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:19,589
normally call
pretty good to be informal

2546
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599

 

2547
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,510

yeah so in particular pseudopolynomial

2548
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,520
yeah so in particular pseudopolynomial
 

2549
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:30,230
yeah so in particular pseudopolynomial
implies polynomial in the special case

2550
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:30,240

 

2551
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,470

so if the input integers

2552
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:36,480

 

2553
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,790

are all at most polynomial

2554
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:42,800

 

2555
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:50,790

in the input size

2556
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,800

 

2557
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,150

this should sound familiar this is a

2558
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
this should sound familiar this is a
 

2559
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,829
this should sound familiar this is a
constraint we've seen before

2560
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:53,839
constraint we've seen before
 

2561
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,390
constraint we've seen before
this is the condition when radix sort

2562
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:56,400
this is the condition when radix sort
 

2563
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,990
this is the condition when radix sort
runs in linear time

2564
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,000
runs in linear time
 

2565
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,230
runs in linear time
ready sort runs in linear time exactly

2566
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
ready sort runs in linear time exactly
 

2567
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,030
ready sort runs in linear time exactly
when

2568
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
when
 

2569
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,990
when
all the input integers are polynomially

2570
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:04,000
all the input integers are polynomially
 

2571
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,870
all the input integers are polynomially
bounded

2572
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:04,880
bounded
 

2573
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,630
bounded
in n which is the size of the array

2574
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
in n which is the size of the array
 

2575
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,630
in n which is the size of the array
which is the input size

2576
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:08,640
which is the input size
 

2577
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,510
which is the input size
okay so same same condition is appearing

2578
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
okay so same same condition is appearing
 

2579
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,710
okay so same same condition is appearing
again so this is sort of a fundamental

2580
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
again so this is sort of a fundamental
 

2581
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,470
again so this is sort of a fundamental
setting to think about and let's see

2582
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:20,480

 

2583
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,670

so in particular

2584
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:23,680
so in particular
 

2585
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,230
so in particular
other structures we've seen like

2586
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,240
other structures we've seen like
 

2587
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,950
other structures we've seen like
counting sort

2588
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
counting sort
 

2589
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,829
counting sort
and direct access arrays are also

2590
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:34,839

 

2591
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,069

pseudopolynomial

2592
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079

so or put a ceiling

2636
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
so or put a ceiling
 

2637
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,549
so or put a ceiling
uh now this is a running time that's a

00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
uh now this is a running time that's a
 

2639
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,589
uh now this is a running time that's a

2651
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,710

but instead of being polynomial the

2652
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:52,720
but instead of being polynomial the
 

2653
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,390
but instead of being polynomial the

2671
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,990
sort
but future classes you might care about

2672
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,000
but future classes you might care about
 

2673
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,549
but future classes you might care about
so the

2674
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:14,559
so the
 

2675
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,190
so the
the nesting is the best thing you can be

2676
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
the nesting is the best thing you can be
 

2677
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,430
the nesting is the best thing you can be
is strongly polynomial

2678
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,440
is strongly polynomial
 

2679
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,190
is strongly polynomial
we just call this polynomial in this

2680
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:21,200
we just call this polynomial in this
 

2681
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,549
we just call this polynomial in this
class

2682
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:22,559
class
 

2683
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,710
class
uh then we have weekly polynomial which

2684
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
uh then we have weekly polynomial which
 

2685
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,109
uh then we have weekly polynomial which
is almost as good but you have this

2686
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:27,119
is almost as good but you have this
 

2687
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,829
is almost as good but you have this
logarithmic dependence on the numbers

2688
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:29,839
logarithmic dependence on the numbers
 

2689
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,270
logarithmic dependence on the numbers
and then the next level is

2690
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
and then the next level is
 

2691
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,030
and then the next level is
pseudopolynomial this is

2692
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,040
pseudopolynomial this is
 

2693
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,109
pseudopolynomial this is
not as good here this really only works

2694
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:35,119
not as good here this really only works
 

2695
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,230
not as good here this really only works
well if the numbers are small

2696
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,240
well if the numbers are small
 

2697
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,069
well if the numbers are small
logarithmic dependence is pretty good

2698
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:40,079
logarithmic dependence is pretty good
 

2699
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,910
logarithmic dependence is pretty good
because even if they're exponential this

2700
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:41,920
because even if they're exponential this
 

2701
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,990
because even if they're exponential this
is polynomial

2702
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
is polynomial
 

2703
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,990
is polynomial
sounds funny but log of an exponential

2704
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,000
sounds funny but log of an exponential
 

2705
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,349
sounds funny but log of an exponential
is polynomial

2706
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
is polynomial
 

2707
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,790
is polynomial
all right enough about pseudopoly the

2708
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
all right enough about pseudopoly the
 

2709
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,829
all right enough about pseudopoly the

the first big technique was how do we

2724
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:07,119
the first big technique was how do we
 

2725
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,630
the first big technique was how do we
define our sub problems

2726
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:08,640
define our sub problems
 

2727
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,030
define our sub problems
did we take prefixes and suffixes or

2728
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,040
did we take prefixes and suffixes or
 

2729
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,829
did we take prefixes and suffixes or
substrings

2730
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
substrings
 

2731
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,870
substrings
of a sequence did we have multiple

2732
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:14,880
of a sequence did we have multiple
 

2733
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,390
of a sequence did we have multiple
sequences and have to take products of

2734
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,400
sequences and have to take products of
 

2735
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,430
sequences and have to take products of
those spaces

2736
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440
those spaces
 

2737
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,030
those spaces
did we have integers and have to take

2738
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,040
did we have integers and have to take
 

2739
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,950
did we have integers and have to take
smaller versions of those integers

2740
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
smaller versions of those integers
 

2741
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,829
smaller versions of those integers
sometimes that leads to

2742
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:21,839
sometimes that leads to
 

2743
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,510
sometimes that leads to
pseudo-polynomial algorithms sometimes

2744
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
pseudo-polynomial algorithms sometimes
 

2745
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,150
pseudo-polynomial algorithms sometimes
not

2746
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,160
not
 

2747
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,309
not
and sometimes we also had sub problems

2748
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:26,319
and sometimes we also had sub problems
 

2749
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:27,589
and sometimes we also had sub problems
that were defined in terms of vertices

2750
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,599
that were defined in terms of vertices

this just happened in shortest path

2752
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
this just happened in shortest path
 

2753
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,549
this just happened in shortest path
problems because that's the only

2754
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
problems because that's the only
 

2755
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,750
problems because that's the only
setting where we saw dp over graphs so

2756
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:33,760
setting where we saw dp over graphs so
 

2757
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,750
setting where we saw dp over graphs so
let me characterize all the dps we've

2758
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:35,760
let me characterize all the dps we've
 

2759
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,470
let me characterize all the dps we've
seen in lecture not the recitation ones

2760
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
seen in lecture not the recitation ones
 

2761
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,750
seen in lecture not the recitation ones
for now

2762
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:41,760

 

2763
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,430

2765
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,829

so for example with the bowling problem

2766
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:47,839
so for example with the bowling problem
 

2767
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,750
so for example with the bowling problem
with bowling pins we only had to deal

2768
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:49,760
with bowling pins we only had to deal
 

2769
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,950
with bowling pins we only had to deal
with prefixes

2770
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:50,960
with prefixes
 

2771
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,870
with prefixes
or suffixes because

2772
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:54,880
or suffixes because
 

2773
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,710
or suffixes because
yeah we were only we could just think

2774
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
yeah we were only we could just think
 

2775
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,910
yeah we were only we could just think
about what happened

2776
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
about what happened
 

2777
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,750
about what happened
for the first couple of pins for example

2778
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:01,760
for the first couple of pins for example
 

2779
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,190
for the first couple of pins for example
also for lcs we had to take

2780
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
also for lcs we had to take
 

2781
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,829
also for lcs we had to take
two different sequences but then we just

2782
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:07,839
two different sequences but then we just
 

2783
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:08,950
two different sequences but then we just
guessed what happened

2784
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:08,960
guessed what happened
 

2785
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,750
guessed what happened
at the in with the first two items of

2786
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
at the in with the first two items of
 

2787
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,230
at the in with the first two items of
each

2788
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
each
 

2789
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,549
each
uh of each sequence and so that only

2790
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:14,559
uh of each sequence and so that only
 

2791
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:15,670
uh of each sequence and so that only
left us with

2792
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:15,680
left us with
 

2793
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,829
left us with
suffixes uh with longest increasing

2794
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:18,839
suffixes uh with longest increasing
 

2795
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,630
suffixes uh with longest increasing
subsequence

2796
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
subsequence
 

2797
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,950
subsequence
again we just guessed whether the first

2798
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,960
again we just guessed whether the first
 

2799
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,750
again we just guessed whether the first
or maybe

2800
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:23,760
or maybe
 

2801
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,069
or maybe
we assumed that the first item was in

2802
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
we assumed that the first item was in
 

2803
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,510
we assumed that the first item was in
the longest increasing subsequence and

2804
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:29,520
the longest increasing subsequence and
 

2805
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,950
the longest increasing subsequence and
then we tried to guess what the next

2806
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
then we tried to guess what the next
 

2807
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,990
then we tried to guess what the next
item was

2808
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:32,000
item was
 

2809
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,829
item was
but that again eliminated everything in

2810
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
but that again eliminated everything in
 

2811
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,190
but that again eliminated everything in
between so we were just left with a

2812
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
between so we were just left with a
 

2813
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,230
between so we were just left with a
suffix

2814
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:36,240
suffix
 

2815
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,430
suffix
this leads me to another

2816
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
this leads me to another
 

2817
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,349
this leads me to another
characterization

2818
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,359
characterization
 

2819
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,670
characterization
of the kind of dynamic programming

2820
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:41,680
of the kind of dynamic programming
 

2821
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,510
of the kind of dynamic programming
techniques which is for

2822
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:43,520
techniques which is for
 

2823
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,670
techniques which is for
in addition to these basic sub-problems

2824
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:45,680
in addition to these basic sub-problems
 

2825
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,150
in addition to these basic sub-problems
we often added constraints and expansion

2826
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:48,160
we often added constraints and expansion
 

2827
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,230
we often added constraints and expansion
and lis is an example of what we call

2828
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:50,240
and lis is an example of what we call
 

2829
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,150
and lis is an example of what we call
non-expansive constraint where

2830
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
non-expansive constraint where
 

2831
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,589
non-expansive constraint where
we just added a constraint to the

2832
00:55:53,589 --> 00:55:53,599
we just added a constraint to the
 

2833
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,069
we just added a constraint to the
problem which was i'd want this first

2834
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:56,079
problem which was i'd want this first
 

2835
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,670
problem which was i'd want this first
item to be in my longest increasing

2836
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:57,680
item to be in my longest increasing
 

2837
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,630
item to be in my longest increasing
subsequence

2838
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:58,640
subsequence
 

2839
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,910
subsequence
but that didn't actually change the

2840
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920
but that didn't actually change the
 

2841
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,510
but that didn't actually change the
number of sub-problems so it didn't

2842
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
number of sub-problems so it didn't
 

2843
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,390
number of sub-problems so it didn't
expand

2844
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400
expand
 

2845
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,910
expand
the number of sub problems this is i

2846
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
the number of sub problems this is i
 

2847
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,589
the number of sub problems this is i
think the only example we saw

2848
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
think the only example we saw
 

2849
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,870
think the only example we saw
with this feature most of the other

2850
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:08,880
with this feature most of the other
 

2851
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,630
with this feature most of the other
times when we added a constraint we also

2852
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
times when we added a constraint we also
 

2853
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,910
times when we added a constraint we also
increased the number of

2854
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:11,920
increased the number of
 

2855
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,349
increased the number of
sub problems which we'll get to

2856
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359

 

2857
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,510

okay also in a certain sense there's

2858
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:19,520
okay also in a certain sense there's
 

2859
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,109
okay also in a certain sense there's
multiple ways to think about this

2860
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:21,119
multiple ways to think about this
 

2861
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,870
multiple ways to think about this
one floyd warshall is a problem

2862
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:24,880
one floyd warshall is a problem
 

2863
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,109
one floyd warshall is a problem
or we define subproblems based on

2864
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:27,119
or we define subproblems based on
 

2865
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,390
or we define subproblems based on
prefixes

2866
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:28,400
prefixes
 

2867
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,670
prefixes
of the vertices right we had vertices 1

2868
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
of the vertices right we had vertices 1
 

2869
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:31,990
of the vertices right we had vertices 1
through

2870
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,000
through
 

2871
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,990
through
n we said is their shortest path using

2872
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
n we said is their shortest path using
 

2873
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,109
n we said is their shortest path using
vertices just

2874
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:35,119
vertices just
 

2875
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,309
vertices just
1 to i so that's a prefix of the vertex

2876
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:38,319
1 to i so that's a prefix of the vertex
 

2877
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:38,630
1 to i so that's a prefix of the vertex
set

2878
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:38,640
set
 

2879
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,470
set
in a particular order so you can think

2880
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:40,480
in a particular order so you can think
 

2881
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,270
in a particular order so you can think
of floyd warshall as being

2882
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:43,280
of floyd warshall as being
 

2883
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,950
of floyd warshall as being
as involving a prefix you can also think

2884
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:44,960
as involving a prefix you can also think
 

2885
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,710
as involving a prefix you can also think
of it as you're given an integer i and

2886
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
of it as you're given an integer i and
 

2887
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,069
of it as you're given an integer i and
you're only allowed to use vertices less

2888
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:48,079
you're only allowed to use vertices less
 

2889
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:48,870
you're only allowed to use vertices less
than or equal to i

2890
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:48,880
than or equal to i
 

2891
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,470
than or equal to i
and so it's also kind of an integer sub

2892
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
and so it's also kind of an integer sub
 

2893
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,270
and so it's also kind of an integer sub
problem but i will leave it up there

2894
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:53,280
problem but i will leave it up there
 

2895
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,829
problem but i will leave it up there
also the two examples we saw today rod

2896
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:56,839
also the two examples we saw today rod
 

2897
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,470
also the two examples we saw today rod
cutting

2898
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
cutting
 

2899
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,589
cutting
kind of uh

2900
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:01,599
kind of uh
 

2901
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,430
kind of uh
you could think of it as either a prefix

2902
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:03,440
you could think of it as either a prefix
 

2903
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,789
you could think of it as either a prefix
on the

2904
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
on the
 

2905
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,349
on the
values or i would prefer to think of it

2906
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:07,359
values or i would prefer to think of it
 

2907
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,630
values or i would prefer to think of it
down here

2908
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,640

 

2909
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,069

where we had an integer and we were

2910
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
where we had an integer and we were
 

2911
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,270
where we had an integer and we were
considering smaller integers also

2912
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,280
considering smaller integers also
 

2913
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,670
considering smaller integers also
and but subset sum definitely had a

2914
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
and but subset sum definitely had a
 

2915
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,950
and but subset sum definitely had a
suffix

2916
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:20,960
suffix
 

2917
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,829
suffix
in addition to having an integer

2918
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:24,839
in addition to having an integer
 

2919
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,030
in addition to having an integer
subproblem

2920
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:27,040

so rod cutting you can put down here

2922
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
so rod cutting you can put down here
 

2923
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,549
so rod cutting you can put down here
because we looked at smaller integers or

2924
00:57:30,549 --> 00:57:30,559
because we looked at smaller integers or
 

2925
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,430
because we looked at smaller integers or
up here but subset sum really is up here

2926
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:33,440
up here but subset sum really is up here
 

2927
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:33,829
up here but subset sum really is up here
and

2928
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:33,839
and
 

2929
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,670
and
down here because we both looked at

2930
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:35,680
down here because we both looked at
 

2931
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,589
down here because we both looked at
suffixes and smaller values of t

2932
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:39,599
suffixes and smaller values of t
 

2933
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,910
suffixes and smaller values of t
okay uh fibonacci also fits down here

2934
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:43,920
okay uh fibonacci also fits down here
 

2935
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,829
okay uh fibonacci also fits down here
fibonacci was another case where we had

2936
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
fibonacci was another case where we had
 

2937
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,270
fibonacci was another case where we had
a number n and we looked at

2938
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280
a number n and we looked at
 

2939
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,630
a number n and we looked at
integers smaller than n ah

2940
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:50,640
integers smaller than n ah
 

2941
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,230
integers smaller than n ah
good i think i've done these now what

2942
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
good i think i've done these now what
 

2943
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,069
good i think i've done these now what
problems involve substrings we saw two

2944
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079
problems involve substrings we saw two
 

2945
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:54,710
problems involve substrings we saw two
of them

2946
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:54,720
of them
 

2947
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,150
of them
one was the alternating coin game

2948
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
one was the alternating coin game
 

2949
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,589
one was the alternating coin game
because we were taking from left or

2950
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
because we were taking from left or
 

2951
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:00,710
because we were taking from left or
right and so we had to look at

2952
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
right and so we had to look at
 

2953
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,990
right and so we had to look at
substrings in between

2954
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:02,000
substrings in between
 

2955
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,030
substrings in between
and the other is parenthesization where

2956
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:05,040
and the other is parenthesization where
 

2957
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,430
and the other is parenthesization where
we

2958
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,440
we
 

2959
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,870
we
had to guess something in the middle and

2960
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
had to guess something in the middle and
 

2961
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,789
had to guess something in the middle and
that left the prefix before it and the

2962
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:08,799
that left the prefix before it and the
 

2963
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,630
that left the prefix before it and the
suffix after both of those are typical

2964
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:10,640
suffix after both of those are typical
 

2965
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,950
suffix after both of those are typical
ways where you get substring problems

2966
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:12,960
ways where you get substring problems
 

2967
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,990
ways where you get substring problems
uh okay so

2968
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,000
uh okay so
 

2969
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,030
uh okay so
pseudo poly

2970
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,040

 

2971
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,390

both of these are pseudo poly

2972
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:22,400
both of these are pseudo poly
 

2973
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,030
both of these are pseudo poly
and those those are the ones that we've

2974
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,040
and those those are the ones that we've
 

2975
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,150
and those those are the ones that we've
seen that are dynamic programs

2976
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:26,160
seen that are dynamic programs
 

2977
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,190
seen that are dynamic programs
pseudopoly

2978
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
pseudopoly
 

2979
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,549
pseudopoly
and then with vertices it's all the

2980
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
and then with vertices it's all the
 

2981
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,870
and then with vertices it's all the
shortest path uh

2982
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
shortest path uh
 

2983
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,030
shortest path uh
problems where we also had a parameter

2984
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:33,040
problems where we also had a parameter
 

2985
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,390
problems where we also had a parameter
which was a vertex these are natural

2986
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:34,400
which was a vertex these are natural
 

2987
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,030
which was a vertex these are natural
because

2988
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,040
because
 

2989
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,470
because
in the goal of sort of single short

2990
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
in the goal of sort of single short
 

2991
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,549
in the goal of sort of single short
shortest paths is distance to each

2992
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:38,559
shortest paths is distance to each
 

2993
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,230
shortest paths is distance to each
vertex and so naturally we had a sub

2994
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240
vertex and so naturally we had a sub
 

2995
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,750
vertex and so naturally we had a sub
problem for each vertex

2996
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:41,760
problem for each vertex
 

2997
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,430
problem for each vertex

okay back to subproblem expansion we saw

3002
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:48,079
okay back to subproblem expansion we saw
 

3003
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,990
okay back to subproblem expansion we saw
a couple of examples alternating coin

00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,400
where you go first and that was really
 

3019
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,190

parenthesization it turned out we needed

3024
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,160

both min and max in order to solve max
 

3027
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,910
both min and max in order to solve max
so we really only cared about max so we

3028
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:11,920
so we really only cared about max so we
 

3029
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,109
so we really only cared about max so we

could cut the first rod we cut could be

3172
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
could cut the first rod we cut could be
 

3173
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,069
could cut the first rod we cut could be
any length

3174
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:32,079
any length
 

3175
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,870
any length
and then finally once you've considered

3176
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:34,880
and then finally once you've considered
 

3177
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,309
and then finally once you've considered
all recursed on all these sub problems

3178
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:36,319
all recursed on all these sub problems
 

3179
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,510
all recursed on all these sub problems
you have to combine them

3180
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:37,520
you have to combine them
 

3181
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,150
you have to combine them
somehow and in a lot of the problems we

3182
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:40,160
somehow and in a lot of the problems we
 

3183
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,430
somehow and in a lot of the problems we
actually just

3184
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:41,440
actually just
 

3185
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,470
actually just
take one the one best choice and that is

3186
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:44,480
take one the one best choice and that is
 

3187
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,230
take one the one best choice and that is
our final solution

3188
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:46,240
our final solution
 

3189
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,870
our final solution
and in those problems the final solution

3190
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:48,880
and in those problems the final solution
 

3191
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,309
and in those problems the final solution
ends up being finding some kind of

3192
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:50,319
ends up being finding some kind of
 

3193
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,069
ends up being finding some kind of
shortest path in a dag

3194
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:52,079
shortest path in a dag
 

3195
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,510
shortest path in a dag
but there are a few cases where we

3196
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:53,520
but there are a few cases where we
 

3197
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,190
but there are a few cases where we
actually took multiple solutions and

3198
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
actually took multiple solutions and
 

3199
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,549
actually took multiple solutions and
combined them together to get the

3200
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:56,559
combined them together to get the
 

3201
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:57,910
combined them together to get the
overall solution

3202
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:57,920
overall solution
 

3203
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,470
overall solution
and this includes fibonacci which is we

3204
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
and this includes fibonacci which is we
 

3205
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,910
and this includes fibonacci which is we
added them

3206
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
added them
 

3207
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,750
added them
not too interesting floyd warshall we

3208
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:03,760
not too interesting floyd warshall we
 

3209
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,589
not too interesting floyd warshall we
concatenated two paths

3210
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:05,599
concatenated two paths
 

3211
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,349
concatenated two paths
and parenthesization is maybe the most

3212
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:07,359
and parenthesization is maybe the most
 

3213
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,109
and parenthesization is maybe the most
interesting where we had to take

3214
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
interesting where we had to take
 

3215
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,910
interesting where we had to take
two parts the prefix and the suffix how

3216
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:11,920
two parts the prefix and the suffix how
 

3217
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,270
two parts the prefix and the suffix how
to solve them and then multiply or add

3218
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:13,280
to solve them and then multiply or add
 

3219
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,430
to solve them and then multiply or add
them together

3220
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
them together
 

3221
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,510
them together
and so these problems are not well

3222
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:17,520
and so these problems are not well
 

3223
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,430
and so these problems are not well
represented by shortest path and a dag

3224
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:19,440
represented by shortest path and a dag
 

3225
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,029
represented by shortest path and a dag
still a dag involved but it's like a

3226
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:21,039
still a dag involved but it's like a
 

3227
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,750
still a dag involved but it's like a
multi-path thing

3228
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:23,760
multi-path thing
 

3229
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,230
multi-path thing
and then finally at the original problem

3230
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
and then finally at the original problem
 

3231
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,309
and then finally at the original problem
often it's just a single sub-problem is

01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:38,559
and floyd warshall these were the order
 

3245

01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,309
that we covered them
so the the three shortest paths and then

01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:42,319
so the the three shortest paths and then
 

3249
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,549
so the the three shortest paths and then
