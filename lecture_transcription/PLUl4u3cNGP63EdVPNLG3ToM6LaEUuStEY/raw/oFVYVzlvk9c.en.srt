the third instructor of6 that you

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,000
the third instructor of6 that you
 

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,910
the third instructor of6 that you
probably forgot about uh but you're

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:26,920
probably forgot about uh but you're
 

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,630
probably forgot about uh but you're
going to see a lot more of me in the

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
going to see a lot more of me in the
 

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,230
going to see a lot more of me in the
graph theory part of our course because

16
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
graph theory part of our course because
 

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,830
graph theory part of our course because
that's the part of algorithms that I

18
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
that's the part of algorithms that I
 

19
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,270
that's the part of algorithms that I
like if I were reincarnated as a

20
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:34,280
like if I were reincarnated as a
 

21
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,869
like if I were reincarnated as a
theoretical computer scientist I would

22
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:35,879
theoretical computer scientist I would
 

23
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,510
theoretical computer scientist I would
probably go into this area hey guys okay

24
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
probably go into this area hey guys okay
 

25
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,229
probably go into this area hey guys okay

two of this class uh there are a few

44
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:02,039
two of this class uh there are a few
 

45
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,869
two of this class uh there are a few
corollaries uh to that fact uh so unless

00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
corollaries uh to that fact uh so unless
 

47
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,149
corollaries uh to that fact uh so unless
there any questions about that we'll get

48
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
there any questions about that we'll get
 

49
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,190
there any questions about that we'll get
started with our our new unit in 66

50
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
started with our our new unit in 66
 

51
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,030
started with our our new unit in 66
which is a graph theory if you're

52
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,040
which is a graph theory if you're
 

53
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,789
which is a graph theory if you're
wondering there's a graph on the the the

54
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:13,799
wondering there's a graph on the the the
 

55
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,870
wondering there's a graph on the the the
screen here uh but of course we'll fill

56
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:15,880
screen here uh but of course we'll fill
 

57
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,469
screen here uh but of course we'll fill
in uh a little bit more information

58
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:17,479
in uh a little bit more information
 

59
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,550
in uh a little bit more information
today uh throughout our lecture when I

60
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
today uh throughout our lecture when I
 

61
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,270
today uh throughout our lecture when I
was learning how to teach which I'm

62
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
was learning how to teach which I'm
 

63
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,950
was learning how to teach which I'm
still doing

64
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
still doing
 

65
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,789
still doing
um one of uh actually my PhD adviser

66
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:25,799
um one of uh actually my PhD adviser
 

67
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,950
um one of uh actually my PhD adviser
told me like if you want somebody to

68
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
told me like if you want somebody to
 

69
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,510
told me like if you want somebody to
learn something you have to write it as

70
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:28,520
learn something you have to write it as
 

71
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,350
learn something you have to write it as
big as possible and so I'm I'm really

72
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,360
big as possible and so I'm I'm really
 

73
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,389
big as possible and so I'm I'm really
leaning into that that approach today uh

74
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:32,399
leaning into that that approach today uh
 

75
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,870
leaning into that that approach today uh
in our our slides so in any event uh

76
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:35,880
in our our slides so in any event uh
 

77
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,030
in our our slides so in any event uh
right so today we're going to have our

78
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
right so today we're going to have our
 

79
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,670
right so today we're going to have our
first lecture on on graphs which I think

80
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
first lecture on on graphs which I think
 

81
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,350
first lecture on on graphs which I think
will somewhat be a review for many of

82
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
will somewhat be a review for many of
 

83
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,590
will somewhat be a review for many of
you guys and if it's not that's cool too

84
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:44,600
you guys and if it's not that's cool too
 

85
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,469
you guys and if it's not that's cool too
uh because we'll start from the

86
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:45,479
uh because we'll start from the
 

87
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,789
uh because we'll start from the
beginning and kind of build up all the

88
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
beginning and kind of build up all the
 

89
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,109
beginning and kind of build up all the
Notions that we need to understand and

90
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
Notions that we need to understand and
 

91
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,550
Notions that we need to understand and
process graphs and hopefully by the end

92
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
process graphs and hopefully by the end
 

93
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,030
process graphs and hopefully by the end
of lecture have some style of algorithm

94
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,040
of lecture have some style of algorithm
 

95
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,590
of lecture have some style of algorithm
for computing the shortest path from one

96
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
for computing the shortest path from one
 

97
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,069
for computing the shortest path from one
vertex to all the other

98
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:57,079
vertex to all the other
 

99
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,029
vertex to all the other
ones so in case we forgot a little bit

100
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:00,039
ones so in case we forgot a little bit
 

101
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,270
ones so in case we forgot a little bit
terminology a graph some people call

102
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,280
terminology a graph some people call
 

103
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,109
terminology a graph some people call
this a network but sometimes that term

104
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:04,119
this a network but sometimes that term
 

105
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:05,950
this a network but sometimes that term
is overloaded with a few different kind

106
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:05,960
is overloaded with a few different kind
 

107
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,109
is overloaded with a few different kind
of variations on the theme uh is a

108
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:08,119
of variations on the theme uh is a
 

109
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,150
of variations on the theme uh is a
collection of two things right that's

110
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
collection of two things right that's
 

111
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,790
collection of two things right that's
what this this parenthesis notation

112
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:11,800
what this this parenthesis notation
 

113
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,630
what this this parenthesis notation
means there's a set of vertices and a

114
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
means there's a set of vertices and a
 

115
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,110
means there's a set of vertices and a
set of edges right and the edges uh like

116
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,120
set of edges right and the edges uh like
 

117
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,550
set of edges right and the edges uh like
you can see in the sort of third point

118
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:19,560
you can see in the sort of third point
 

119
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,869
you can see in the sort of third point
on our screen here are a subset of V

120
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
on our screen here are a subset of V
 

121
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,830
on our screen here are a subset of V
cross V now this is fancy notation for

122
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:24,840
cross V now this is fancy notation for
 

123
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,309
cross V now this is fancy notation for
something really really

124
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
something really really
 

125
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,110
something really really
simple right because what is this

126
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,120
simple right because what is this
 

127
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,270
simple right because what is this
telling me this is telling me that an

128
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,280
telling me this is telling me that an
 

129
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,509
telling me this is telling me that an
like in the picture that we see on the

130
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
like in the picture that we see on the
 

131
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,270
like in the picture that we see on the
screen here it's just something that

132
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
screen here it's just something that
 

133
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,949
screen here it's just something that
connects two vertices

134
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
connects two vertices
 

135
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,790
connects two vertices
together right so if I think of there

136
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
together right so if I think of there
 

137
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,630
together right so if I think of there
being a pair of vertices like the from

138
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
being a pair of vertices like the from
 

139
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,550
being a pair of vertices like the from
and the to right then that is a subset

140
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,560
and the to right then that is a subset
 

141
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,710
and the to right then that is a subset
of the cross product of v in itself

142
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,720
of the cross product of v in itself
 

143
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,390
of the cross product of v in itself
right so hopefully the notation in that

144
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,400
right so hopefully the notation in that
 

145
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,910
right so hopefully the notation in that
third line on the screen makes some

146
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:46,920
third line on the screen makes some
 

147
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,910
third line on the screen makes some
sense this is just fancy notation for

148
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:48,920
sense this is just fancy notation for
 

149
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,509
sense this is just fancy notation for
edges or pairs of vertices but of course

150
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
edges or pairs of vertices but of course
 

151
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,470
edges or pairs of vertices but of course
inside of that notation there are two

152
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,480
inside of that notation there are two
 

153
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,670
inside of that notation there are two
special cases that we care about uh in

154
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
special cases that we care about uh in
 

155
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,110
special cases that we care about uh in
this this class uh one is is when you

156
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,120
this this class uh one is is when you
 

157
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,710
this this class uh one is is when you
have a directed graph and one is when

158
00:02:59,710 --> 00:02:59,720
have a directed graph and one is when
 

159
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,790
have a directed graph and one is when
you you have an undirected graph gu I

160
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:01,800
you you have an undirected graph gu I
 

161
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,110
you you have an undirected graph gu I
said them in opposite order from what's

162
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
said them in opposite order from what's
 

163
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,190
said them in opposite order from what's
on the screen right so in an undirected

164
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,200
on the screen right so in an undirected
 

165
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,430
on the screen right so in an undirected
graph I guess we still think of an edge

166
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,440
graph I guess we still think of an edge
 

167
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,949
graph I guess we still think of an edge
like a pair of vertices but really I

00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:09,959
like a pair of vertices but really I
 

169
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,149

should have notated this slightly

170
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:11,159
should have notated this slightly
 

171
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,390
should have notated this slightly
differently in fact maybe I'll I'll

00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
undirected edge there's no such thing as
 

201
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,550
undirected edge there's no such thing as
an edge from W to V being distinct from

203
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,309
an edge from W to V being distinct from
an edge from V to W those are the same

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,030
an edge from V to W those are the same
thing right they're undirected it's just

206
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,040
thing right they're undirected it's just
 

207
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,630
thing right they're undirected it's just
is a notion of connectivity whereas in a

is a notion of connectivity whereas in a
 

209
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,309
is a notion of connectivity whereas in a
directed graph now we're going to use

210
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
directed graph now we're going to use
 

211
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,069
directed graph now we're going to use
that parenthetical notation to say that

212
00:03:59,069 --> 00:03:59,079
that parenthetical notation to say that
 

213
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,270
that parenthetical notation to say that
the Edge from W to V is different than

00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,280
the Edge from W to V is different than
 

215
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,589
the Edge from W to V is different than
the Edge from V to W that's going to

216
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:04,599
the Edge from V to W that's going to
 

217
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,149
the Edge from V to W that's going to
make a big difference so for example uh

218
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,159
make a big difference so for example uh
 

219
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,589
make a big difference so for example uh
in the graph on the right let's maybe

220
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
in the graph on the right let's maybe
 

221
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,750
in the graph on the right let's maybe
redraw it uh on the board here so we

222
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:12,760
redraw it uh on the board here so we
 

223
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,830
redraw it uh on the board here so we
have four vertices I drew this last

224
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:14,840
have four vertices I drew this last
 

225
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,550
have four vertices I drew this last
night and I'm hoping that this example

226
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
night and I'm hoping that this example
 

227
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,509
night and I'm hoping that this example
actually works

228
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:20,519

 

229
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,230

uh uh like

230
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,240
uh uh like
 

231
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,950
uh uh like
that can I get from the upper right

232
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:25,960
that can I get from the upper right
 

233
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,310
that can I get from the upper right
vertex to the lower left vertex

234

one two three no right because if I
 

241
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,550
one two three no right because if I
wanted to I mean maybe I think of

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:39,560
wanted to I mean maybe I think of
 

243
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,029
wanted to I mean maybe I think of
drawing this path here but of course if

ever drawn I'm so sorry uh you notice
 

251
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,629
ever drawn I'm so sorry uh you notice

conference was about graph Theory uh and

484
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
conference was about graph Theory uh and
 

485
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,190
conference was about graph Theory uh and
and and the reason for that uh is sort

486
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,200
and and the reason for that uh is sort
 

487
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,870
and and the reason for that uh is sort
of a theme that shows up a lot in

488
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:43,880
of a theme that shows up a lot in
 

489
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,630
of a theme that shows up a lot in
Geometry World which is if I take my

490
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
Geometry World which is if I take my
 

491
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,949
Geometry World which is if I take my
state in this case I think these are the

492
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:47,959
state in this case I think these are the
 

493
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,389
state in this case I think these are the
voting precincts in some state or

494
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
voting precincts in some state or
 

495
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,790
voting precincts in some state or
another uh and I look at adjacency

496
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
another uh and I look at adjacency
 

497
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,870
another uh and I look at adjacency
relationships then maybe I put a node

498
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
relationships then maybe I put a node
 

499
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,949
relationships then maybe I put a node
for every Precinct and an edge anytime

500
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
for every Precinct and an edge anytime
 

501
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,630
for every Precinct and an edge anytime
that they share a boundary with one

502
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
that they share a boundary with one
 

503
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,389
that they share a boundary with one
another well now I have a network and

504
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:01,399
another well now I have a network and
 

505
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,190
another well now I have a network and
and maybe a region on my graph is like a

506
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
and maybe a region on my graph is like a
 

507
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,069
and maybe a region on my graph is like a
connected piece of of of this this

508
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:05,079
connected piece of of of this this
 

509
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,470
connected piece of of of this this
network uh and so anyway this is one of

510
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:07,480
network uh and so anyway this is one of
 

511
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,630
network uh and so anyway this is one of
these examples where graphs and networks

512
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:09,640
these examples where graphs and networks
 

513
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,590
these examples where graphs and networks
and connectivity and so on just show up

514
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
and connectivity and so on just show up
 

515
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,069
and connectivity and so on just show up
literally no matter where you go they're

516
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:13,079
literally no matter where you go they're
 

517
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,750
literally no matter where you go they're
totally unavoidable uh and and so that's

518
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
totally unavoidable uh and and so that's
 

519
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,949
totally unavoidable uh and and so that's
what we'll be spending quite a bit of

520
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
what we'll be spending quite a bit of
 

521
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,230
what we'll be spending quite a bit of
time on uh in this class

522
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,240
time on uh in this class
 

523
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,269
time on uh in this class
here now you could easily take I would

524
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:22,279
here now you could easily take I would
 

525
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,110
here now you could easily take I would
argue at least three entire courses on

526
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
argue at least three entire courses on
 

527
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,750
argue at least three entire courses on
graph Theory uh here at MIT uh and you

528
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
graph Theory uh here at MIT uh and you
 

529
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,230
graph Theory uh here at MIT uh and you
could easily build a PhD uh a doing

530
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
could easily build a PhD uh a doing
 

531
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,630
could easily build a PhD uh a doing
nothing more than really simple problems

532
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:31,640
nothing more than really simple problems
 

533
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,630
nothing more than really simple problems
on graphs uh of course in this class

534
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:33,640
on graphs uh of course in this class
 

535
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,790
on graphs uh of course in this class
we're we're we're limited to you know

536
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:35,800
we're we're we're limited to you know
 

537
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,069
we're we're we're limited to you know
some some just a few lectures out of

00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:38,079
some some just a few lectures out of
 

539
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,750
some some just a few lectures out of
many uh so we're going to make a couple

540
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
many uh so we're going to make a couple
 

541
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,150
many uh so we're going to make a couple
assumptions both on the problems we want

542
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,160
assumptions both on the problems we want
 

543
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,030
assumptions both on the problems we want
to solve uh as well as on the graphs

544
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
to solve uh as well as on the graphs
 

545
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,949
to solve uh as well as on the graphs
that that we care about uh so in

546
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
that that we care about uh so in
 

547
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,150
that that we care about uh so in
particular uh one simplifying assumption

548
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,160
particular uh one simplifying assumption
 

549
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,829
particular uh one simplifying assumption
which actually really doesn't affect

550
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
which actually really doesn't affect
 

551
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,310
which actually really doesn't affect
many of the algorithms we'll talk about

552
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
many of the algorithms we'll talk about
 

553
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,829
many of the algorithms we'll talk about
here but is worth noting uh explicitly

554
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:52,839
here but is worth noting uh explicitly
 

555
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,750
here but is worth noting uh explicitly
is that we'll mostly be thinking about a

556
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:54,760
is that we'll mostly be thinking about a
 

557
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,269
is that we'll mostly be thinking about a
particular type of graph which is a

558
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:56,279
particular type of graph which is a
 

559
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,670
particular type of graph which is a
simple

560
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
simple
 

561
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,110
simple
graph uh and in fact often depending on

562
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,120
graph uh and in fact often depending on
 

563
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,190
graph uh and in fact often depending on
how you define your graph you kind of

564
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,200
how you define your graph you kind of
 

565
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,949
how you define your graph you kind of
accidentally made your graph simple uh

566
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:03,959
accidentally made your graph simple uh
 

567
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,430
accidentally made your graph simple uh
even if you didn't intend to so for

568
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
even if you didn't intend to so for
 

569
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,790
even if you didn't intend to so for
example uh we wrote that our edges were

570
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:07,800
example uh we wrote that our edges were
 

571
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,350
example uh we wrote that our edges were
a subset of V cross V uh which maybe

572
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,360
a subset of V cross V uh which maybe
 

573
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,710
a subset of V cross V uh which maybe
means that I can't have uh multiple

574
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
means that I can't have uh multiple
 

575
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,990
means that I can't have uh multiple
edges that uh you know sort of trans

576
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,000
edges that uh you know sort of trans
 

577
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,710
edges that uh you know sort of trans
Traverse the same pair of vertices

578
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:17,720
Traverse the same pair of vertices
 

579
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,389
Traverse the same pair of vertices
so let's see an example of a graph that

580
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
so let's see an example of a graph that
 

581
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,069
so let's see an example of a graph that
is not simple so sorry I haven't

582
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:23,079
is not simple so sorry I haven't
 

583
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,990
is not simple so sorry I haven't
actually defined it a simple graph is a

584
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,000
actually defined it a simple graph is a
 

585
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,509
actually defined it a simple graph is a
a graph that has no self Loops so I

586
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
a graph that has no self Loops so I
 

587
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,269
a graph that has no self Loops so I
can't go from a Vertex to itself

588
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:30,279
can't go from a Vertex to itself
 

589
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,750
can't go from a Vertex to itself
and every Edge is distinct so let's uh

590
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:32,760
and every Edge is distinct so let's uh
 

591
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,550
and every Edge is distinct so let's uh
make the most nonsimple graph we can

592
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:35,560
make the most nonsimple graph we can
 

593
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,470
make the most nonsimple graph we can
think of like let's say I have two

594
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:39,480
think of like let's say I have two
 

595
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,069
think of like let's say I have two
vertices uh so maybe uh if I want to

596
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
vertices uh so maybe uh if I want to
 

597
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,069
vertices uh so maybe uh if I want to
make my so there's a graph right two

598
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
make my so there's a graph right two
 

599
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,350
make my so there's a graph right two
vertices in one Edge this is simple if I

600
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
vertices in one Edge this is simple if I
 

601
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,030
vertices in one Edge this is simple if I
wanted to be annoying and make it not

602
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
wanted to be annoying and make it not
 

603
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,110
wanted to be annoying and make it not
simple maybe I'd take this Edge and I'd

604
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
simple maybe I'd take this Edge and I'd
 

605
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,269
simple maybe I'd take this Edge and I'd
like duplicate it three times just for

606
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
like duplicate it three times just for
 

607
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,310
like duplicate it three times just for
for fun uh that violates the second

608
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
for fun uh that violates the second
 

609
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,350
for fun uh that violates the second
assumption and now to make it even worse

610
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,360
assumption and now to make it even worse
 

611
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,030
assumption and now to make it even worse
I could violate the first one by adding

612
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,040
I could violate the first one by adding
 

613
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,990
I could violate the first one by adding
an edge that goes from this vertex to

614
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
an edge that goes from this vertex to
 

615
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,110
an edge that goes from this vertex to
itself this is

616
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
itself this is
 

617
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,829
itself this is
not

618
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:08,839

 

619
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,629

simple I don't know what you would call

620
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:10,639
simple I don't know what you would call
 

621
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,990
simple I don't know what you would call
it actually General graph I guess

622
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,000
it actually General graph I guess
 

623
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,910
it actually General graph I guess
complicated because it's not simple I

624
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:14,920
complicated because it's not simple I
 

625
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,310
complicated because it's not simple I
don't I don't know uh yeah a multi-graph

626
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,320
don't I don't know uh yeah a multi-graph
 

627
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,389
don't I don't know uh yeah a multi-graph
I always thought of that as something

628
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
I always thought of that as something
 

629
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,949
I always thought of that as something
anyway it doesn't matter uh but in any

630
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
anyway it doesn't matter uh but in any
 

631
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,350
anyway it doesn't matter uh but in any
event in this class we're not going to

632
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,360
event in this class we're not going to
 

633
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,150
event in this class we're not going to
worry about this particular uh

634
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
worry about this particular uh
 

635
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,590
worry about this particular uh
circumstance and of course in many

636
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
circumstance and of course in many
 

637
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,949
circumstance and of course in many
applications of graph Theory that's

638
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
applications of graph Theory that's
 

639
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,910
applications of graph Theory that's
totally reasonable assumption to make

640
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
totally reasonable assumption to make
 

641
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,190
totally reasonable assumption to make
any questions about definition of a

00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:35,639

 

645
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,389

graph okay so from now on whenever we

646
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
graph okay so from now on whenever we
 

647
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,910
graph okay so from now on whenever we
think about a graph in the back of our

648
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
think about a graph in the back of our
 

649
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,150
think about a graph in the back of our
head we're going to think of our graph

650
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,160
head we're going to think of our graph
 

651
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,829
head we're going to think of our graph
as simple there's one nice property that

652
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
as simple there's one nice property that
 

653
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,790
as simple there's one nice property that
a simple graph has which I've written in

654
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:45,800
a simple graph has which I've written in
 

655
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,350
a simple graph has which I've written in
really big text on the screen here which

656
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,360
really big text on the screen here which
 

657
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,269
really big text on the screen here which
is that the edges are Big O of of of v^2

658
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:52,279
is that the edges are Big O of of of v^2
 

659
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,110
is that the edges are Big O of of of v^2
and in fact let's uh let's expand that

660
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,120
and in fact let's uh let's expand that
 

661
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,190
and in fact let's uh let's expand that
formula just a tiny bit so there's sort

662
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,200
formula just a tiny bit so there's sort
 

663
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,190
formula just a tiny bit so there's sort
of two cases uh right one is when my

664
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:58,200
of two cases uh right one is when my
 

665
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,269
of two cases uh right one is when my
graph is undirected the other is when my

666
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:00,279
graph is undirected the other is when my
 

667
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,150
graph is undirected the other is when my
my graph is is directed yeah um so if I

668
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
my graph is is directed yeah um so if I
 

669
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,150
my graph is is directed yeah um so if I
have a directed

670
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,160

 

671
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,230

graph well let's think about how many

672
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,240
graph well let's think about how many
 

673
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,949
graph well let's think about how many
edges we could possibly have right so an

674
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:15,959
edges we could possibly have right so an
 

675
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,829
edges we could possibly have right so an
edge is a pair of a from vertex and a

676
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:18,839
edge is a pair of a from vertex and a
 

677
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,230
edge is a pair of a from vertex and a
two

678
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
two
 

679
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,670
two
vertex right and I can never repeat it

680
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:22,680
vertex right and I can never repeat it
 

681
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,150
vertex right and I can never repeat it
twice right that's that's sort of like

682
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
twice right that's that's sort of like
 

683
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,189
twice right that's that's sort of like
the uh the second assumption here right

684
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:27,199
the uh the second assumption here right
 

685
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,509
the uh the second assumption here right
so in particular what do we know know we

686
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
so in particular what do we know know we
 

687
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,750
so in particular what do we know know we
know that mod e or rather the number of

688
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
know that mod e or rather the number of
 

689
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,069
know that mod e or rather the number of
of edges in our graph is upper

690
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:35,079
of edges in our graph is upper
 

691
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:37,350
of edges in our graph is upper
bounded by what

692
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
bounded by what
 

693
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,069
bounded by what
well I can take any pair of of

694
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:43,079

 

695
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,030

vertices like that but I have to be a

696
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
vertices like that but I have to be a
 

697
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,030
vertices like that but I have to be a
little bit careful because my graph is

698
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
little bit careful because my graph is
 

699
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,069
little bit careful because my graph is
directed right so from and to matter

700
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
directed right so from and to matter
 

701
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,069
directed right so from and to matter
here so this is is V choose two is

702
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
here so this is is V choose two is
 

703
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,790
here so this is is V choose two is
saying that I can take any unique pair

704
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:53,800
saying that I can take any unique pair
 

705
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,509
saying that I can take any unique pair
of

706
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:54,519
of
 

707
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,470
of
vertices but I have to put a factor of

708
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
vertices but I have to put a factor of
 

709
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,629
vertices but I have to put a factor of
two in front of it uh to account for the

710
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
two in front of it uh to account for the
 

711
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,189
two in front of it uh to account for the
fact that the source and the target can

712
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:00,199
fact that the source and the target can
 

713
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,350
fact that the source and the target can
be flipped back and forth and of course

714
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:02,360
be flipped back and forth and of course
 

715
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,230
be flipped back and forth and of course
if I want to do the undirected I don't

716
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
if I want to do the undirected I don't
 

717
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,189
if I want to do the undirected I don't
have to worry about

718
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:09,199

 

719
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,470

that right we'll get e here is less than

720
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
that right we'll get e here is less than
 

721
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,470
that right we'll get e here is less than
or equal to just mod V choose to right

722
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
or equal to just mod V choose to right
 

723
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,030
or equal to just mod V choose to right
so this is just a fancy uh way of saying

724
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
so this is just a fancy uh way of saying
 

725
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,269
so this is just a fancy uh way of saying
that every Edge consists of two vertices

726
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
that every Edge consists of two vertices
 

727
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,470
that every Edge consists of two vertices
and my edges are unique and one thing if

728
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,480
and my edges are unique and one thing if
 

729
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,310
and my edges are unique and one thing if
you just write down the formula for uh

730
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,320
you just write down the formula for uh
 

731
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,030
you just write down the formula for uh
our our binomial coefficient here as

732
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
our our binomial coefficient here as
 

733
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,269
our our binomial coefficient here as
we'll see that both of these things

734
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:32,279

 

735
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,550

oops oh yeah

736
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560

 

737
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,389

s our at worst mod V uh Square

738
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:42,399

 

739
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,829

here and that makes perfect sense right

740
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:44,839
here and that makes perfect sense right
 

741
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,069
here and that makes perfect sense right
because of course an edge is a pair of

742
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
because of course an edge is a pair of
 

743
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,750
because of course an edge is a pair of
vertices you kind of expect there to be

744
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
vertices you kind of expect there to be
 

745
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,590
vertices you kind of expect there to be
a square

746
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600

 

747
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,990

yes I'm so sorry I can't hear you sorry

748
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
yes I'm so sorry I can't hear you sorry
 

749
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,310
yes I'm so sorry I can't hear you sorry
so the two comes from the backr it's

750
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
so the two comes from the backr it's
 

751
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,550
so the two comes from the backr it's
from the swamp

752
00:13:59,550 --> 00:13:59,560
from the swamp
 

753
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,550
from the swamp
yes exactly so the the the two uh for

754
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:01,560
yes exactly so the the the two uh for
 

755
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,430
yes exactly so the the the two uh for
the directed case comes from the fact

756
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
the directed case comes from the fact
 

757
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,430
the directed case comes from the fact
that an edge from V to W is different

758
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:06,440
that an edge from V to W is different
 

759
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,189
that an edge from V to W is different
than an edge from W to V right so

760
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
than an edge from W to V right so
 

761
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,509
than an edge from W to V right so
remember that the binomial uh

762
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:10,519
remember that the binomial uh
 

763
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,030
remember that the binomial uh
coefficient here is just counting the

764
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,040
coefficient here is just counting the
 

765
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,389
coefficient here is just counting the
number of ways that I can choose two

766
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:13,399
number of ways that I can choose two
 

767
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,470
number of ways that I can choose two
things from a set of size V but it

768
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:15,480
things from a set of size V but it
 

769
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,389
things from a set of size V but it
doesn't care about ordering yeah any

770
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
doesn't care about ordering yeah any
 

771
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,829
doesn't care about ordering yeah any
other

772
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
other
 

773
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,470
other
questions fabulous so why is this going

774
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
questions fabulous so why is this going
 

775
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,389
questions fabulous so why is this going
to matter well these sorts of bounds I

776
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
to matter well these sorts of bounds I
 

777
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,470
to matter well these sorts of bounds I
mean they might seem a little bit

778
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:25,480
mean they might seem a little bit
 

779
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,990
mean they might seem a little bit
obvious to you but we're going to write

780
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,000
obvious to you but we're going to write
 

781
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,670
obvious to you but we're going to write
down graph algorithms and now when we

782
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:28,680
down graph algorithms and now when we
 

783
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,590
down graph algorithms and now when we
analyze the runtime and the space that

784
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:30,600
analyze the runtime and the space that
 

785
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,590
analyze the runtime and the space that
they take we now have like sort of two

786
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:32,600
they take we now have like sort of two
 

787
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,949
they take we now have like sort of two
different numbers that we can think

788
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:33,959
different numbers that we can think
 

789
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,629
different numbers that we can think
about right the number of vertices and

790
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:35,639
about right the number of vertices and
 

791
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,590
about right the number of vertices and
the number of

792
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:36,600
the number of
 

793
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,790
the number of
edges right and so for instance if I

794
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
edges right and so for instance if I
 

795
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,350
edges right and so for instance if I
write down an algorithm whose runtime is

796
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
write down an algorithm whose runtime is
 

797
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,710
write down an algorithm whose runtime is
proportional to the number of edges

798
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:43,720
proportional to the number of edges
 

799
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,310
proportional to the number of edges
maybe then generically I could also

800
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
maybe then generically I could also
 

801
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,150
maybe then generically I could also
think of the algorithm uh as having a

802
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,160
think of the algorithm uh as having a
 

803
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,470
think of the algorithm uh as having a
runtime that looks like the number of

804
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
runtime that looks like the number of
 

805
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,230
runtime that looks like the number of
vertices squared unless I put some

806
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
vertices squared unless I put some
 

807
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,269
vertices squared unless I put some
additional assumptions on my My Graph

808
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:52,279
additional assumptions on my My Graph
 

809
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,389
additional assumptions on my My Graph
right and so there's some connection

810
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:53,399
right and so there's some connection
 

811
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,069
right and so there's some connection
between all these different constants

812
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:55,079
between all these different constants
 

813
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,269
between all these different constants
and it's useful to kind of keep that at

814
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:56,279
and it's useful to kind of keep that at
 

815
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,430
and it's useful to kind of keep that at
the back of our head that sometimes

816
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
the back of our head that sometimes
 

817
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,590
the back of our head that sometimes
you'll see a bunch of different

818
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:58,600
you'll see a bunch of different
 

819
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,509
you'll see a bunch of different
expressions that really are encoding

820
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:00,519
expressions that really are encoding
 

821
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,269
expressions that really are encoding
roughly the same relationship just in

822
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:02,279
roughly the same relationship just in
 

823
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,269
roughly the same relationship just in
different

824
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
different
 

825
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,310
different
language of course that also means that

826
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,320
language of course that also means that
 

827
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,509
language of course that also means that
we can be more precise right so

828
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
we can be more precise right so
 

829
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,269
we can be more precise right so
sometimes uh a graph is what we would

830
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
sometimes uh a graph is what we would
 

831
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,949
sometimes uh a graph is what we would
call sparse so in my universe almost all

832
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:11,959
call sparse so in my universe almost all
 

833
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,629
call sparse so in my universe almost all
graphs that I deal with in my day-to-day

834
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:13,639
graphs that I deal with in my day-to-day
 

835
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,470
graphs that I deal with in my day-to-day
life are extremely sparse this is a

836
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
life are extremely sparse this is a
 

837
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,990
life are extremely sparse this is a
consequence of of topology uh and and

838
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,000
consequence of of topology uh and and
 

839
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,310
consequence of of topology uh and and
because of that an algorithm that scales

840
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:21,320
because of that an algorithm that scales
 

841
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,189
because of that an algorithm that scales
like the number of edges might actually

842
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
like the number of edges might actually
 

843
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,509
like the number of edges might actually
be much preferable to an algorithm that

844
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
be much preferable to an algorithm that
 

845
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,870
be much preferable to an algorithm that
scales like the number of vertices

846
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
scales like the number of vertices
 

847
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,030
scales like the number of vertices
squared because in practice often there

848
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
squared because in practice often there
 

849
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,790
squared because in practice often there
fewer edges than like every single

850
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
fewer edges than like every single
 

851
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,389
fewer edges than like every single
possible pair right uh and and and so

852
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:33,399
possible pair right uh and and and so
 

853
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,069
possible pair right uh and and and so
that's the sort of reason why is worth

854
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:35,079
that's the sort of reason why is worth
 

855
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:36,350
that's the sort of reason why is worth
thinking about these

856
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,360
thinking about these
 

857
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,509
thinking about these
numbers okay so let's continue making

858
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:38,519
numbers okay so let's continue making
 

859
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,069
numbers okay so let's continue making
boring uh definitions here uh so some

860
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:41,079
boring uh definitions here uh so some
 

861
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,629
boring uh definitions here uh so some
other ones that we should think about uh

862
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
other ones that we should think about uh
 

863
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,509
other ones that we should think about uh
involve the uh topology or the

864
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:44,519
involve the uh topology or the
 

865
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,590
involve the uh topology or the
connectivity of our graph uh in

866
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:46,600
connectivity of our graph uh in
 

867
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,030
connectivity of our graph uh in
particular thinking about

868
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,040
particular thinking about
 

869
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,269
particular thinking about
neighbors right so in general we kind of

870
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:50,279
neighbors right so in general we kind of
 

871
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,430
neighbors right so in general we kind of
think about uh pairs of vertices as

872
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:52,440
think about uh pairs of vertices as
 

873
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,110
think about uh pairs of vertices as
being neighbors of one another uh if

874
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,120
being neighbors of one another uh if
 

875
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,150
being neighbors of one another uh if
there's an edge between them we have to

876
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
there's an edge between them we have to
 

877
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,150
there's an edge between them we have to
be a little bit careful uh because of

878
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
be a little bit careful uh because of
 

879
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,350
be a little bit careful uh because of
course uh when we have a directed Edge

880
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,360
course uh when we have a directed Edge
 

881
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,389
course uh when we have a directed Edge
we have to be careful who's on the sort

882
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
we have to be careful who's on the sort
 

883
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,030
we have to be careful who's on the sort
of giving and the receiving end of this

884
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,040
of giving and the receiving end of this
 

885
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,230
of giving and the receiving end of this
this neighbor relationship yeah so let's

886
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
this neighbor relationship yeah so let's
 

887
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,749
this neighbor relationship yeah so let's
draw a really really simple graph so

888
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:08,759
draw a really really simple graph so
 

889
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,389
draw a really really simple graph so
here's vertex zero here's vertex one

890
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:11,399
here's vertex zero here's vertex one
 

891
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,110
here's vertex zero here's vertex one
here's vertex 2 and maybe we'll have an

892
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,120
here's vertex 2 and maybe we'll have an
 

893
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,150
here's vertex 2 and maybe we'll have an
edge going up Edge going down and then a

894
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,160
edge going up Edge going down and then a
 

895
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,670
edge going up Edge going down and then a
cycle

896
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:20,680
cycle
 

897
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,230
cycle
here okay now we can define a lot of

898
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
here okay now we can define a lot of
 

899
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,030
here okay now we can define a lot of
different Notions of neighbors like the

900
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,040
different Notions of neighbors like the
 

901
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,870
different Notions of neighbors like the
outgoing neighbor set the incoming

902
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:27,880
outgoing neighbor set the incoming
 

903
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,269
outgoing neighbor set the incoming
neighbor set uh and and the basic idea

904
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:30,279
neighbor set uh and and the basic idea
 

905
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,990
neighbor set uh and and the basic idea
here is that we want to keep track of

906
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
here is that we want to keep track of
 

907
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,949
here is that we want to keep track of
edges going from a vertex and edges

908
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:33,959
edges going from a vertex and edges
 

909
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,949
edges going from a vertex and edges
pointing into one yeah so for instance

910
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
pointing into one yeah so for instance
 

911
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,309
pointing into one yeah so for instance
the outgoing neighbor set which we're

912
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:38,319
the outgoing neighbor set which we're
 

913
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:43,949
the outgoing neighbor set which we're
going to uh uh uh notate as adj plus

914
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:43,959
going to uh uh uh notate as adj plus
 

915
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,749
going to uh uh uh notate as adj plus
here what is the outgoing neighbor uh

916
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:46,759
here what is the outgoing neighbor uh
 

917
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,870
here what is the outgoing neighbor uh
set of uh node zero here well if we take

918
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:49,880
set of uh node zero here well if we take
 

919
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,509
set of uh node zero here well if we take
a look notice that there's one Edge

920
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
a look notice that there's one Edge
 

921
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,069
a look notice that there's one Edge
going out of node zero and it points to

922
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:53,079
going out of node zero and it points to
 

923
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:57,189
going out of node zero and it points to
node two so of course this is set which

924
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
node two so of course this is set which
 

925
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,430
node two so of course this is set which
just contains one other node

926
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
just contains one other node
 

927
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,430
just contains one other node
and

928
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
and
 

929
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,750
and
similarly the incoming neighbor set of

930
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:04,760
similarly the incoming neighbor set of
 

931
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,150
similarly the incoming neighbor set of
node zero well notice that there's one

932
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,160
node zero well notice that there's one
 

933
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,909
node zero well notice that there's one
incoming neighbor from vertex one so

934
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:10,919
incoming neighbor from vertex one so
 

935
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,230
incoming neighbor from vertex one so
that is a set like

936
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,240
that is a set like
 

937
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,789
that is a set like
that now of course in an undirected

938
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:15,799
that now of course in an undirected
 

939
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,669
that now of course in an undirected
graph uh the sort of distinction between

940
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
graph uh the sort of distinction between
 

941
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,470
graph uh the sort of distinction between
these two uh things doesn't matter so if

942
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:19,480
these two uh things doesn't matter so if
 

943
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,990
these two uh things doesn't matter so if
you look at our final uh bullet point

944
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,000
you look at our final uh bullet point
 

945
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,990
you look at our final uh bullet point
here uh often in the undirected case we

946
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,000
here uh often in the undirected case we
 

947
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,029
here uh often in the undirected case we
just drop that plus or minus superscript

948
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
just drop that plus or minus superscript
 

949
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,829
just drop that plus or minus superscript
because it sort of doesn't matter yeah

950
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
because it sort of doesn't matter yeah
 

951
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,270
because it sort of doesn't matter yeah
uh in any event there's one additional

952
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,280
uh in any event there's one additional
 

953
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,750
uh in any event there's one additional
piece of terminology that matters quite

954
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
piece of terminology that matters quite
 

955
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,230
piece of terminology that matters quite
a bit which is degree and this is

956
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
a bit which is degree and this is
 

957
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,150
a bit which is degree and this is
nothing more than just counting the size

958
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
nothing more than just counting the size
 

959
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,029
nothing more than just counting the size
of this set right so the out degree is

960
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:38,039
of this set right so the out degree is
 

961
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,789
of this set right so the out degree is
the number of edges that point out of a

962
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:39,799
the number of edges that point out of a
 

963
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,950
the number of edges that point out of a
Vertex and the in degree is the number

964
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:41,960
Vertex and the in degree is the number
 

965
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,870
Vertex and the in degree is the number
of edges that point in so notice in in

966
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
of edges that point in so notice in in
 

967
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,590
of edges that point in so notice in in
this case both of those numbers are are

968
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:46,600
this case both of those numbers are are
 

969
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,630
this case both of those numbers are are
one uh let's see an example where

970
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
one uh let's see an example where
 

971
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,070
one uh let's see an example where
they're not so in node one notice

972
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,080
they're not so in node one notice
 

973
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,310
they're not so in node one notice
there's two edges that come out so the

974
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:53,320
there's two edges that come out so the
 

975
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,390
there's two edges that come out so the
out degree of of node one is two there's

976
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
out degree of of node one is two there's
 

977
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,950
out degree of of node one is two there's
one Edge that points in so the in degree

978
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
one Edge that points in so the in degree
 

979
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,630
one Edge that points in so the in degree
is

980
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
is
 

981
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,310
is
one okay so often why why are we going

982
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,320
one okay so often why why are we going
 

983
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,270
one okay so often why why are we going
to do this well we're going to write a

984
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,280
to do this well we're going to write a
 

985
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,990
to do this well we're going to write a
lot of graph algorithms that like have a

986
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
lot of graph algorithms that like have a
 

987
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,630
lot of graph algorithms that like have a
for Loop over the neighbors of a given

988
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:07,640
for Loop over the neighbors of a given
 

989
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,950
for Loop over the neighbors of a given
vertex uh and then this this degree

990
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:09,960
vertex uh and then this this degree
 

991
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,789
vertex uh and then this this degree
number is going to come into play um is

992
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
number is going to come into play um is
 

993
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,310
number is going to come into play um is
worth uh bounding these things just a

994
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,320
worth uh bounding these things just a
 

995
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,830
worth uh bounding these things just a
tiny bit so uh in

996
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
tiny bit so uh in
 

997
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,990
tiny bit so uh in
particular one thing we could think

998
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,000

 

999
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,070

about I write too big and I'm going to

1000
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,080
about I write too big and I'm going to
 

1001
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,149
about I write too big and I'm going to
run out of space really quickly here um

1002
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:28,159
run out of space really quickly here um
 

1003
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,590
run out of space really quickly here um
is the following so let's take a look at

1004
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:30,600
is the following so let's take a look at
 

1005
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,669
is the following so let's take a look at
all of the possible uh nodes inside of

1006
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
all of the possible uh nodes inside of
 

1007
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,190
all of the possible uh nodes inside of
my graph and now let's sum up all of

1008
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,200
my graph and now let's sum up all of
 

1009
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,110
my graph and now let's sum up all of
their

1010
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120

 

1011
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,789

degrees right so like I'm going to let's

1012
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:43,799
degrees right so like I'm going to let's
 

1013
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,510
degrees right so like I'm going to let's
see if I look at this graph you know

1014
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
see if I look at this graph you know
 

1015
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,549
see if I look at this graph you know
then notice there's you know there three

1016
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:47,559
then notice there's you know there three
 

1017
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,470
then notice there's you know there three
Al uh three edges adjacent to this

1018
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:49,480
Al uh three edges adjacent to this
 

1019
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,630
Al uh three edges adjacent to this
vertex here three edges adjacent to that

1020
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:51,640
vertex here three edges adjacent to that
 

1021
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,470
vertex here three edges adjacent to that
one two adjacent to this so I sum them

1022
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:53,480
one two adjacent to this so I sum them
 

1023
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,870
one two adjacent to this so I sum them
all together so is a convenient bound to

1024
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:55,880
all together so is a convenient bound to
 

1025
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,870
all together so is a convenient bound to
have around uh is to sum these things

1026
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:57,880
have around uh is to sum these things
 

1027
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,870
have around uh is to sum these things
because we're going to have algorithms

1028
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
because we're going to have algorithms
 

1029
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,870
because we're going to have algorithms
that look like for every vertex for

1030
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
that look like for every vertex for
 

1031
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,669
that look like for every vertex for
every neighbor do something so we might

1032
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:02,679
every neighbor do something so we might
 

1033
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,630
every neighbor do something so we might
as well know kind of roughly how much

1034
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
as well know kind of roughly how much
 

1035
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,270
as well know kind of roughly how much
time that's going to take um let's think

1036
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
time that's going to take um let's think
 

1037
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,909
time that's going to take um let's think
about this so what do we know in an

1038
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:10,919
about this so what do we know in an
 

1039
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,549
about this so what do we know in an
undirected graph every Edge is adjacent

1040
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
undirected graph every Edge is adjacent
 

1041
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,149
undirected graph every Edge is adjacent
to two

1042
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:16,159
to two
 

1043
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,870
to two
vertices right so if we think about how

1044
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:19,880
vertices right so if we think about how
 

1045
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,750
vertices right so if we think about how
we account for

1046
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
we account for
 

1047
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,190
we account for
degree what do we know well we know that

1048
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,200
degree what do we know well we know that
 

1049
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,830
degree what do we know well we know that
an edge sort of contributes to the

1050
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
an edge sort of contributes to the
 

1051
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,510
an edge sort of contributes to the
degree of two different

1052
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
degree of two different
 

1053
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,549
degree of two different
vertices right

1054
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559

 

1055
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,029

so if we think about it uh carefully

1056
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
so if we think about it uh carefully
 

1057
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,029
so if we think about it uh carefully
here what we're going to see is that uh

1058
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
here what we're going to see is that uh
 

1059
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,070
here what we're going to see is that uh
if our graph is

1060
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080

 

1061
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,190

undirected oh oops

1062
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
undirected oh oops
 

1063
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,510
undirected oh oops
sorry is that right wait I'm backward

1064
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:48,520
sorry is that right wait I'm backward
 

1065
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,549
sorry is that right wait I'm backward
again so if I have a graph with two

1066
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:51,559
again so if I have a graph with two
 

1067
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,350
again so if I have a graph with two
vertices and one Edge and it is

1068
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
vertices and one Edge and it is
 

1069
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,669
vertices and one Edge and it is
undirected notice

1070
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:56,679
undirected notice
 

1071
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,669
undirected notice
that the number of edges here is is one

1072
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
that the number of edges here is is one
 

1073
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,669
that the number of edges here is is one
what is the the sum of the

1074
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
what is the the sum of the
 

1075
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,789
what is the the sum of the
degree well it's 1 + 1 equal 2

1076
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:05,799
degree well it's 1 + 1 equal 2
 

1077
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,710
degree well it's 1 + 1 equal 2
yeah so there's a two here if uh my my

1078
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
yeah so there's a two here if uh my my
 

1079
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,029
yeah so there's a two here if uh my my
graph is

1080
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:14,039

 

1081
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,270

undirected and E if my graph is

1082
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,280
undirected and E if my graph is
 

1083
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,549
undirected and E if my graph is
directed if what I'm counting is just

1084
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:21,559
directed if what I'm counting is just
 

1085
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,230
directed if what I'm counting is just
the outgoing

1086
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
the outgoing
 

1087
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,350
the outgoing
degree that Mak sense I think I managed

1088
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,360
degree that Mak sense I think I managed
 

1089
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,990
degree that Mak sense I think I managed
to totally botch that sentence so maybe

1090
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
to totally botch that sentence so maybe
 

1091
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,549
to totally botch that sentence so maybe
let's let's try that again so if I'm

1092
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:29,559
let's let's try that again so if I'm
 

1093
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,430
let's let's try that again so if I'm
counting just the number of edges

1094
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
counting just the number of edges
 

1095
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,029
counting just the number of edges
pointing out of every vertex and I count

1096
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:34,039
pointing out of every vertex and I count
 

1097
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,510
pointing out of every vertex and I count
that over all of the possible vertices

1098
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:36,520
that over all of the possible vertices
 

1099
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,110
that over all of the possible vertices
then there's two cases right one is

1100
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,120
then there's two cases right one is
 

1101
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,230
then there's two cases right one is
directed and one is undirected right so

1102
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
directed and one is undirected right so
 

1103
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,070
directed and one is undirected right so
in the undirected case you get a two

1104
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
in the undirected case you get a two
 

1105
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,950
in the undirected case you get a two
here because essentially every Edge is

1106
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:43,960
here because essentially every Edge is
 

1107
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,310
here because essentially every Edge is
simultaneously ingoing and outgoing

1108
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
simultaneously ingoing and outgoing
 

1109
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,029
simultaneously ingoing and outgoing
whereas you get a one as a coefficient

1110
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:48,039
whereas you get a one as a coefficient
 

1111
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,230
whereas you get a one as a coefficient
in the directed case that make sense I'm

1112
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
in the directed case that make sense I'm
 

1113
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,230
in the directed case that make sense I'm
sorry I botched that for a

1114
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
sorry I botched that for a
 

1115
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,350
sorry I botched that for a
second okay excellent okay so that's

1116
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
second okay excellent okay so that's
 

1117
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,750
second okay excellent okay so that's
going to be a useful Bound for us uh

1118
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:56,760
going to be a useful Bound for us uh
 

1119
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,549
going to be a useful Bound for us uh
later on now we think about graphs of

1120
00:20:59,549 --> 00:20:59,559
later on now we think about graphs of
 

1121
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,710
later on now we think about graphs of
course we just spent the last couple

1122
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
course we just spent the last couple
 

1123
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,549
course we just spent the last couple
weeks thinking about data structures we

1124
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
weeks thinking about data structures we
 

1125
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,909
weeks thinking about data structures we
should think about how to store a graph

1126
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:03,919
should think about how to store a graph
 

1127
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,549
should think about how to store a graph
on a computer and there's many different

1128
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:05,559
on a computer and there's many different
 

1129
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,230
on a computer and there's many different
options uh in fact uh really one thing

1130
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
options uh in fact uh really one thing
 

1131
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,230
options uh in fact uh really one thing
that you can do is sort of pair just

1132
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,240
that you can do is sort of pair just
 

1133
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,310
that you can do is sort of pair just
like when we talked about sets uh right

1134
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
like when we talked about sets uh right
 

1135
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,630
like when we talked about sets uh right
there are many different ways to store

1136
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:13,640
there are many different ways to store
 

1137
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,230
there are many different ways to store
sets and and one way to think about it

1138
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,240
sets and and one way to think about it
 

1139
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,870
sets and and one way to think about it
was depending on how we're going to

1140
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
was depending on how we're going to
 

1141
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,750
was depending on how we're going to
interact with that set we might choose

1142
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:18,760
interact with that set we might choose
 

1143
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,830
interact with that set we might choose
one data structure or another to sort of

1144
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:20,840
one data structure or another to sort of
 

1145
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,070
one data structure or another to sort of
optimize the uh types of of of

1146
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,080
optimize the uh types of of of
 

1147
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,110
optimize the uh types of of of
interactions we're going to have with

1148
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,120
interactions we're going to have with
 

1149
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,470
interactions we're going to have with
that set and make them as fast as

1150
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:25,480
that set and make them as fast as
 

1151
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,669
that set and make them as fast as
possible there's exactly the same story

1152
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
possible there's exactly the same story
 

1153
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,470
possible there's exactly the same story
uh for a graph

1154
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:29,480
uh for a graph
 

1155
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,750
uh for a graph
right so for instance the world's

1156
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
right so for instance the world's
 

1157
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,230
right so for instance the world's
dumbest representation of a graph would

1158
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
dumbest representation of a graph would
 

1159
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,269
dumbest representation of a graph would
be to just have a long list of edges

1160
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:36,279
be to just have a long list of edges
 

1161
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,789
be to just have a long list of edges
right so for example uh for this graph

1162
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
right so for example uh for this graph
 

1163
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,110
right so for example uh for this graph
uh up here maybe I have you know 01

1164
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,120
uh up here maybe I have you know 01
 

1165
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,590
uh up here maybe I have you know 01
that's an edge and then 0 two that's

1166
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
that's an edge and then 0 two that's
 

1167
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,870
that's an edge and then 0 two that's
another Edge and then one two and then 2

1168
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:49,880
another Edge and then one two and then 2
 

1169
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,070
another Edge and then one two and then 2
one there's a big list of edges really

1170
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,080
one there's a big list of edges really
 

1171
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,630
one there's a big list of edges really
set I don't care about the

1172
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
set I don't care about the
 

1173
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,029
set I don't care about the
order first one is one Z One Z oh you're

1174
00:21:58,029 --> 00:21:58,039
order first one is one Z One Z oh you're
 

1175
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,590
order first one is one Z One Z oh you're
right I'm sorry yeah the edge points up

1176
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:00,600
right I'm sorry yeah the edge points up
 

1177
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,310
right I'm sorry yeah the edge points up
thanks Eric or not Eric

1178
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320

 

1179
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,630

Jason okay so let's say that I have a

1180
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:07,640
Jason okay so let's say that I have a
 

1181
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,430
Jason okay so let's say that I have a
graph algorithm and I'm going to have to

1182
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
graph algorithm and I'm going to have to
 

1183
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,669
graph algorithm and I'm going to have to
do something like check whether there

1184
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
do something like check whether there
 

1185
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,789
do something like check whether there
exists an edge from V to w a bunch of

1186
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:15,799
exists an edge from V to w a bunch of
 

1187
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,070
exists an edge from V to w a bunch of
times how long is that going to take in

1188
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080
times how long is that going to take in
 

1189
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,029
times how long is that going to take in
in this data structure well if I just

1190
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:20,039
in this data structure well if I just
 

1191
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,789
in this data structure well if I just
have like a hot mess disorganized list

1192
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:21,799
have like a hot mess disorganized list
 

1193
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,830
have like a hot mess disorganized list
of edges and I want to know does there

1194
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
of edges and I want to know does there
 

1195
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,230
of edges and I want to know does there
exist an edge from V to W All I Can Do

1196
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,240
exist an edge from V to W All I Can Do
 

1197
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,029
exist an edge from V to W All I Can Do
Is Write a for Loop that just goes along

1198
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:28,039
Is Write a for Loop that just goes along
 

1199
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,830
Is Write a for Loop that just goes along
this set and says like is this Edge what

1200
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
this set and says like is this Edge what
 

1201
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,430
this set and says like is this Edge what
I'm looking for no is that the edge I'm

1202
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
I'm looking for no is that the edge I'm
 

1203
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,590
I'm looking for no is that the edge I'm
looking for no right so every single

1204
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:33,600
looking for no right so every single
 

1205
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,590
looking for no right so every single
time I want to find an edge it's going

1206
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
time I want to find an edge it's going
 

1207
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,110
time I want to find an edge it's going
to take me time proportional to the

1208
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,120
to take me time proportional to the
 

1209
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,630
to take me time proportional to the
number of edges in my graph which could

1210
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:39,640
number of edges in my graph which could
 

1211
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,390
number of edges in my graph which could
potentially be up to to V squ yeah so

1212
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
potentially be up to to V squ yeah so
 

1213
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,630
potentially be up to to V squ yeah so
this is not such a great representation

1214
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
this is not such a great representation
 

1215
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,230
this is not such a great representation
of a graph on my

1216
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240
of a graph on my
 

1217
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,190
of a graph on my
computer right so if we're thinking back

1218
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,200
computer right so if we're thinking back
 

1219
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,750
computer right so if we're thinking back
at our our data structure we might say

1220
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
at our our data structure we might say
 

1221
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,070
at our our data structure we might say
okay so an edge list is probably not the

1222
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,080
okay so an edge list is probably not the
 

1223
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,950
okay so an edge list is probably not the
way to go although notice that the way

1224
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
way to go although notice that the way
 

1225
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,669
way to go although notice that the way
we notated like what is a graph kind of

1226
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:54,679
we notated like what is a graph kind of
 

1227
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,269
we notated like what is a graph kind of
looks like an edge list uh but in any

1228
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:57,279
looks like an edge list uh but in any
 

1229
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,230
looks like an edge list uh but in any
event uh the the the more common thing

1230
00:22:59,230 --> 00:22:59,240
event uh the the the more common thing
 

1231
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,789
event uh the the the more common thing
to do is to sore something like an

1232
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
to do is to sore something like an
 

1233
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,549
to do is to sore something like an
adjacency list so uh right so the basic

1234
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
adjacency list so uh right so the basic
 

1235
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,390
adjacency list so uh right so the basic
idea of an adjacency

1236
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:07,400
idea of an adjacency
 

1237
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,990
idea of an adjacency
list is that what I'm going to

1238
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
list is that what I'm going to
 

1239
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,029
list is that what I'm going to
store uh is a

1240
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
store uh is a
 

1241
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,510
store uh is a
set that

1242
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
set that
 

1243
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,789
set that
Maps a

1244
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:17,799
Maps a
 

1245
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:23,310
Maps a
Vertex U to everything adjacent to

1246
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,320
Vertex U to everything adjacent to
 

1247
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,549
Vertex U to everything adjacent to
you right so in other words I'm just

1248
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:25,559
you right so in other words I'm just
 

1249
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,909
you right so in other words I'm just
going to keep track of all the outgoing

1250
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:26,919
going to keep track of all the outgoing
 

1251
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,789
going to keep track of all the outgoing
edges from every vertex

1252
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:29,799
edges from every vertex
 

1253
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,669
edges from every vertex
and now I have to decide how am I going

1254
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
and now I have to decide how am I going
 

1255
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,029
and now I have to decide how am I going
to store this

1256
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
to store this
 

1257
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,950
to store this
object and often times we're going to

1258
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
object and often times we're going to
 

1259
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,269
object and often times we're going to
have to answer queries like does there

1260
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:36,279
have to answer queries like does there
 

1261
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,950
have to answer queries like does there
exist an edge from V to W right so how

1262
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
exist an edge from V to W right so how
 

1263
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,070
exist an edge from V to W right so how
could I do that first I would look up V

1264
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
could I do that first I would look up V
 

1265
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,470
could I do that first I would look up V
and I get back sort of a list or set of

1266
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
and I get back sort of a list or set of
 

1267
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,070
and I get back sort of a list or set of
of all the things that are adjacent to V

1268
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
of all the things that are adjacent to V
 

1269
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,390
of all the things that are adjacent to V
and I have to query that thing and I

1270
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:47,400
and I have to query that thing and I
 

1271
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,029
and I have to query that thing and I
want it to be pretty fast so maybe what

1272
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:50,039
want it to be pretty fast so maybe what
 

1273
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,789
want it to be pretty fast so maybe what
I do is I

1274
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799

 

1275
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,230

store uh the set of adjacent

1276
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,240
store uh the set of adjacent
 

1277
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,590
store uh the set of adjacent
stuff as something like a uh direct

1278
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:00,600
stuff as something like a uh direct
 

1279
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,470
stuff as something like a uh direct
access array or a hash

1280
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:03,480
access array or a hash
 

1281
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:13,870
access array or a hash
table um to make that look up uh

1282
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:13,880

 

1283
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,909

fast so for example uh how long would it

1284
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:16,919
fast so for example uh how long would it
 

1285
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,029
fast so for example uh how long would it
take I see I'm going to finish the

1286
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:18,039
take I see I'm going to finish the
 

1287
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,630
take I see I'm going to finish the
sentence here uh how long would it take

1288
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,640
sentence here uh how long would it take
 

1289
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,510
sentence here uh how long would it take
me to check if an edge exists in my My

1290
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
me to check if an edge exists in my My
 

1291
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,630
me to check if an edge exists in my My
Graph well what would I do I would first

1292
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:23,640
Graph well what would I do I would first
 

1293
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,070
Graph well what would I do I would first
pull out this object and then I look

1294
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,080
pull out this object and then I look
 

1295
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,669
pull out this object and then I look
inside of here right so if I stored this

1296
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
inside of here right so if I stored this
 

1297
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,590
inside of here right so if I stored this
as a hash table than an expected time I

1298
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
as a hash table than an expected time I
 

1299
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,070
as a hash table than an expected time I
would have order one look up right

1300
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,080
would have order one look up right
 

1301
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,630
would have order one look up right
because this is order one and then you

1302
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
because this is order one and then you
 

1303
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,830
because this is order one and then you
have another order one look up there so

1304
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:34,840
have another order one look up there so
 

1305
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,190
have another order one look up there so
we went from v^2 to to one with one

1306
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
we went from v^2 to to one with one
 

1307
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,470
we went from v^2 to to one with one
simple trick

1308
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:41,480

 

1309
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,789

yes that's a great question um so

1310
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:43,799
yes that's a great question um so
 

1311
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,549
yes that's a great question um so
there's a design decision here I'm sorry

1312
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:45,559
there's a design decision here I'm sorry
 

1313
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,070
there's a design decision here I'm sorry
in my head I think a lot about

1314
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,080
in my head I think a lot about
 

1315
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,549
in my head I think a lot about
undirected graphs and I'm going to make

1316
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
undirected graphs and I'm going to make
 

1317
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,870
undirected graphs and I'm going to make
this mistake a lot and I'm glad that you

1318
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:49,880
this mistake a lot and I'm glad that you
 

1319
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,669
this mistake a lot and I'm glad that you
caught me um there's a totally

1320
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
caught me um there's a totally
 

1321
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,149
caught me um there's a totally
reasonable thing to do which is maybe

1322
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:53,159
reasonable thing to do which is maybe
 

1323
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,830
reasonable thing to do which is maybe
just to keep track of the outer edge the

1324
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:54,840
just to keep track of the outer edge the
 

1325
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,870
just to keep track of the outer edge the
outgoing edges for every vertex this is

1326
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
outgoing edges for every vertex this is
 

1327
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,909
outgoing edges for every vertex this is
a design decision for an algorithm

1328
00:24:58,909 --> 00:24:58,919
a design decision for an algorithm
 

1329
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,070
a design decision for an algorithm
maybe I want to keep track of the

1330
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
maybe I want to keep track of the
 

1331
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,830
maybe I want to keep track of the
incoming edges what whatever I just have

1332
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
incoming edges what whatever I just have
 

1333
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,470
incoming edges what whatever I just have
to make sure that it aligns with what I

1334
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,480
to make sure that it aligns with what I
 

1335
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,510
to make sure that it aligns with what I
want to do with my graph later yep

1336
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
want to do with my graph later yep
 

1337
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,389
want to do with my graph later yep
excellent point sorry as as a geometry

1338
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:08,399
excellent point sorry as as a geometry

graphs uh but it's important to keep

1342
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,240
graphs uh but it's important to keep
 

1343
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,590
graphs uh but it's important to keep
remembering that not everybody works on

1344
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:14,600
remembering that not everybody works on
 

1345
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,029
remembering that not everybody works on
the same problems that I

1346
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:16,039
the same problems that I
 

1347
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,310
the same problems that I
do okay um now if I wanted to be totally

1348
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,320
do okay um now if I wanted to be totally
 

1349
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,510
do okay um now if I wanted to be totally
extreme about it uh as as just a third

1350
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
extreme about it uh as as just a third

00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:23,159
example of representation which actually
 

1353
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,669
example of representation which actually
in some sense you could think of like an

1354
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:24,679
in some sense you could think of like an
 

1355
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,430
in some sense you could think of like an
adjacency list be an adjacency Matrix

1356
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
adjacency list be an adjacency Matrix
 

1357
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,909
adjacency list be an adjacency Matrix
where now I just keep like like a giant

1358
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:28,919
where now I just keep like like a giant
 

1359
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,029
where now I just keep like like a giant
v byv array of like does this Edge exist

1360
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:32,039
v byv array of like does this Edge exist
 

1361
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,549
v byv array of like does this Edge exist
Does that edge exist um now it's really

1362
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
Does that edge exist um now it's really
 

1363
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,669
Does that edge exist um now it's really
really easy to check if an edge

1364
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
really easy to check if an edge
 

1365
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,029
really easy to check if an edge
exists but now let's say that I make a

1366
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:40,039
exists but now let's say that I make a
 

1367
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,430
exists but now let's say that I make a
graph algorithm that's going to have a

1368
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440
graph algorithm that's going to have a
 

1369
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,149
graph algorithm that's going to have a
for Loop over all the neighbors of some

1370
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
for Loop over all the neighbors of some
 

1371
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,230
for Loop over all the neighbors of some
vertex right so

1372
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
vertex right so
 

1373
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,870
vertex right so
here that if I wanted to Loop over all

1374
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
here that if I wanted to Loop over all
 

1375
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,590
here that if I wanted to Loop over all
the neighbors of you I could do that in

1376
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:50,600
the neighbors of you I could do that in
 

1377
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,870
the neighbors of you I could do that in
time proportional to the number of

1378
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:51,880
time proportional to the number of
 

1379
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,269
time proportional to the number of
neighbors of

1380
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
neighbors of
 

1381
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,710
neighbors of
you but if I just have a big adjacency

1382
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:55,720
you but if I just have a big adjacency
 

1383
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,510
you but if I just have a big adjacency
Matrix just a bunch of binary values

1384
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
Matrix just a bunch of binary values
 

1385
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,070

like for pair of vertices are these

1386
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,080
like for pair of vertices are these
 

1387
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,950
like for pair of vertices are these
vertices adjacent yeah or nay if I want

1388
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
vertices adjacent yeah or nay if I want
 

1389
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,149
vertices adjacent yeah or nay if I want
to iterate over all my neighbors now I

1390
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:05,159
to iterate over all my neighbors now I
 

1391
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,070
to iterate over all my neighbors now I
have to iterate over all the vertices

1392
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,080
have to iterate over all the vertices
 

1393
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,269
have to iterate over all the vertices
and check is that number one and then do

1394
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:09,279
and check is that number one and then do
 

1395
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,110
and check is that number one and then do
something so actually that can incur

1396
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
something so actually that can incur
 

1397
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,830
something so actually that can incur
some additional time and additional

1398
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:12,840
some additional time and additional
 

1399
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,350
some additional time and additional
space does that make

1400
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
space does that make
 

1401
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,990
space does that make
sense so in any event that's a sort of

1402
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
sense so in any event that's a sort of
 

1403
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,710
sense so in any event that's a sort of
the Lazy Man's graph representation I

1404
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:19,720
the Lazy Man's graph representation I
 

1405
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,190
the Lazy Man's graph representation I
use it a lot when I'm coding uh because

1406
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
use it a lot when I'm coding uh because
 

1407
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,230
use it a lot when I'm coding uh because
adjy matrices are easy to work with but

1408
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,240
adjy matrices are easy to work with but
 

1409
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,590
adjy matrices are easy to work with but
it does incur a lot of additional space

1410
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
it does incur a lot of additional space
 

1411
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,590
it does incur a lot of additional space
uh and it's not always the most

1412
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:26,600
uh and it's not always the most
 

1413
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,909
uh and it's not always the most
efficient thing even if you have the

1414
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:27,919
efficient thing even if you have the
 

1415
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,830
efficient thing even if you have the
space because iterating over neighbors

1416
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
space because iterating over neighbors
 

1417
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,909
space because iterating over neighbors
is actually can take quite a bit of

1418
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
is actually can take quite a bit of
 

1419
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,110
is actually can take quite a bit of
time okay so the the real point of our

1420
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,120
time okay so the the real point of our
 

1421
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,510
time okay so the the real point of our
lecture today uh is to start introducing

1422
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:36,520
lecture today uh is to start introducing
 

1423
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,190
lecture today uh is to start introducing
sort of the canonical problem that we

1424
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,200
sort of the canonical problem that we
 

1425
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,230
sort of the canonical problem that we
all worry about on graphs which is

1426
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,240
all worry about on graphs which is
 

1427
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,470
all worry about on graphs which is
Computing paths in particular shortest

1428
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
Computing paths in particular shortest
 

1429
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,630
Computing paths in particular shortest
paths uh so the first thing we should do

1430
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
paths uh so the first thing we should do
 

1431
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,230
paths uh so the first thing we should do
is is of course Define what a a path is

1432
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:47,240
is is of course Define what a a path is
 

1433
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,389
is is of course Define what a a path is
on a graph so we're going to think about

1434
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:49,399
on a graph so we're going to think about
 

1435
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,590
on a graph so we're going to think about
our graph like a road Network right

1436
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
our graph like a road Network right
 

1437
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,510
our graph like a road Network right
let's think of maybe every node here as

1438
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
let's think of maybe every node here as
 

1439
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,990
let's think of maybe every node here as
an intersection right so this is a

1440
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000
an intersection right so this is a
 

1441
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,710
an intersection right so this is a
roughly Kendall Square see it's a it's a

1442
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:57,720
roughly Kendall Square see it's a it's a
 

1443
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,750
roughly Kendall Square see it's a it's a
square

1444
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:58,760
square
 

1445
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,710
square
um but in in in any event uh let's say

1446
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:01,720
um but in in in any event uh let's say
 

1447
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,669
um but in in in any event uh let's say
that I want to find uh maybe question

1448
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:04,679
that I want to find uh maybe question
 

1449
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,350
that I want to find uh maybe question
one would be you know does there exist a

1450
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,360
one would be you know does there exist a
 

1451
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,990
one would be you know does there exist a
way to get from vertex one to vertex 3

1452
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,000
way to get from vertex one to vertex 3
 

1453
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,470
way to get from vertex one to vertex 3
and then a better question to ask would

1454
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
and then a better question to ask would
 

1455
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,029
and then a better question to ask would
be does there exist a short way to get

1456
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:12,039
be does there exist a short way to get
 

1457
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,430
be does there exist a short way to get
from vertex one to vertex 3 then of

1458
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:14,440
from vertex one to vertex 3 then of
 

1459
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,549
from vertex one to vertex 3 then of
course the first thing I have to do is

1460
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:15,559
course the first thing I have to do is
 

1461
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,029
course the first thing I have to do is
Define my enemy I have to Define what

1462
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:17,039
Define my enemy I have to Define what
 

1463
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,710
Define my enemy I have to Define what
I'm looking for which is a path so a

1464
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:19,720
I'm looking for which is a path so a
 

1465
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,230
I'm looking for which is a path so a
path is nothing more than a sequence of

1466
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,240
path is nothing more than a sequence of
 

1467
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,430
path is nothing more than a sequence of
vertices in a graph where every pair of

1468
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:24,440
vertices in a graph where every pair of
 

1469
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,510
vertices in a graph where every pair of
adjacent vertices in that sequence is an

1470
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:26,520
adjacent vertices in that sequence is an
 

1471
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,230
adjacent vertices in that sequence is an
ed I think it's all with our intuition

1472
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,240
ed I think it's all with our intuition
 

1473
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,549
ed I think it's all with our intuition
of what a a path is in a graph so for

1474
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:31,559
of what a a path is in a graph so for
 

1475
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,269
of what a a path is in a graph so for
instance here's a path P equals V1 V2 V3

1476
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
instance here's a path P equals V1 V2 V3
 

1477
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,070
instance here's a path P equals V1 V2 V3
so notice that there's an edge from V1

1478
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,080
so notice that there's an edge from V1
 

1479
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,149
so notice that there's an edge from V1
to V2 and also an edge from V2 to V3 so

1480
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
to V2 and also an edge from V2 to V3 so
 

1481
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,590
to V2 and also an edge from V2 to V3 so
it satisfies the assumptions set forth

1482
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:42,600
it satisfies the assumptions set forth
 

1483
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,630
it satisfies the assumptions set forth
on our

1484
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
on our
 

1485
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,789
on our
definition what would not be a path in

1486
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
definition what would not be a path in
 

1487
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,149
definition what would not be a path in
our graph would be like V1 comma V3

1488
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:49,159
our graph would be like V1 comma V3
 

1489
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:51,029
our graph would be like V1 comma V3
right because there's no Edge

1490
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
right because there's no Edge
 

1491
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,710
right because there's no Edge
there okay so if we talk about paths uh

1492
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
there okay so if we talk about paths uh
 

1493
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,389
there okay so if we talk about paths uh
then there's a very natural uh notion

1494
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
then there's a very natural uh notion
 

1495
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,430
then there's a very natural uh notion
which is the length

1496
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,440
which is the length
 

1497
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,870
which is the length
length I guess you could think of like

1498
00:27:59,870 --> 00:27:59,880
length I guess you could think of like
 

1499
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,389
length I guess you could think of like
the number of vertices in your path

1500
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:01,399
the number of vertices in your path
 

1501
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:03,950
the number of vertices in your path
minus one or uh the number of edges that

1502
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:03,960
minus one or uh the number of edges that
 

1503
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,549
minus one or uh the number of edges that
your your path traverses those are the

1504
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:05,559
your your path traverses those are the
 

1505
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,990
your your path traverses those are the
same thing right so for instance the

1506
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,000
same thing right so for instance the
 

1507
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,710
same thing right so for instance the
length of the path P here is two

1508
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:10,720
length of the path P here is two
 

1509
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,470
length of the path P here is two
everybody see that a very common coding

1510
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:13,480
everybody see that a very common coding
 

1511
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,470
everybody see that a very common coding
bug that I encounter a lot is adding one

1512
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
bug that I encounter a lot is adding one
 

1513
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,029
bug that I encounter a lot is adding one
to that number by accident um because of

1514
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
to that number by accident um because of
 

1515
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,830
to that number by accident um because of
course there's one more vertex in your

1516
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:20,840
course there's one more vertex in your
 

1517
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,870
course there's one more vertex in your
your path than there are

1518
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880
your path than there are
 

1519
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,909
your path than there are
edges okay and and there are many

1520
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:24,919
edges okay and and there are many
 

1521
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:26,990
edges okay and and there are many
different uh there could be potentially

1522
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,000
different uh there could be potentially
 

1523
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,110
different uh there could be potentially
more than one uh path between any pair

1524
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
more than one uh path between any pair
 

1525
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,350
more than one uh path between any pair
of vertices so let's say that I have an

1526
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
of vertices so let's say that I have an
 

1527
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,950
of vertices so let's say that I have an
undirected graph uh that looks like the

1528
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:33,960
undirected graph uh that looks like the
 

1529
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,789
undirected graph uh that looks like the
following so it's just a square plus a

1530
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:36,799
following so it's just a square plus a
 

1531
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,750
following so it's just a square plus a
diagonal so here are

1532
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:40,760
diagonal so here are
 

1533
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,470
diagonal so here are
nodes right so then a perfectly valid

1534
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:43,480
nodes right so then a perfectly valid
 

1535
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,029
nodes right so then a perfectly valid
path from the lower left to the upper

1536
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:45,039
path from the lower left to the upper
 

1537
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,149
path from the lower left to the upper
right be to go one over and one up but

1538
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
right be to go one over and one up but
 

1539
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,430
right be to go one over and one up but
of course there's a more efficient way

1540
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,440
of course there's a more efficient way
 

1541
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,950
of course there's a more efficient way
to get from the lower left to the upper

1542
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
to get from the lower left to the upper
 

1543
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,750
to get from the lower left to the upper
right which is to go across the

1544
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:53,760
right which is to go across the
 

1545
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,669
right which is to go across the
diagonal and so when we talk about the

1546
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:55,679
diagonal and so when we talk about the
 

1547
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,350
diagonal and so when we talk about the
shortest path is nothing more than the

1548
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,360
shortest path is nothing more than the
 

1549
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,070
shortest path is nothing more than the
length of the path that has the fewest

1550
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,080
length of the path that has the fewest
 

1551
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,110
length of the path that has the fewest
number of edges or vertices in it

1552
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
number of edges or vertices in it
 

1553
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,870
number of edges or vertices in it
between any pair of vert uh vertices in

1554
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
between any pair of vert uh vertices in

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,430
between any pair of vert uh vertices in

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,269
Graph okay so this is our enemy this is
what we're after is Computing the

1560
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:08,279
what we're after is Computing the
 

1561
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,509
what we're after is Computing the
shortest uh uh path between vertices in

1562
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:10,519
shortest uh uh path between vertices in
 

1563
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,990
shortest uh uh path between vertices in
a graph uh and and this is a thing uh

1564
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,000
a graph uh and and this is a thing uh
 

1565
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,310
a graph uh and and this is a thing uh
that that we'll be talking about quite a

1566
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,320
that that we'll be talking about quite a
 

1567
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,669
that that we'll be talking about quite a
bit in this course because of course

1568
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
bit in this course because of course
 

1569
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,950
bit in this course because of course
it's a very practical matter right like

1570
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:16,960
it's a very practical matter right like
 

1571
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,710
it's a very practical matter right like
when I saw want to solve routing

1572
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:18,720
when I saw want to solve routing
 

1573
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,149
when I saw want to solve routing
problems I want to like move packets on

1574
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
problems I want to like move packets on
 

1575
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,110
problems I want to like move packets on

1576
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,120
my network I prefer not to well unless
 

1577
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,549
my network I prefer not to well unless
I'm doing tour I'd prefer them you know

1578
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:24,559
I'm doing tour I'd prefer them you know
 

1579
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,110
I'm doing tour I'd prefer them you know
not to hit too many uh computers in

1580
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,120
not to hit too many uh computers in
 

1581
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,310
not to hit too many uh computers in
between uh then maybe I want a a

1582
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
between uh then maybe I want a a
 

1583
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,470
between uh then maybe I want a a
shortest path or or uh you know on a

1584
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
shortest path or or uh you know on a
 

1585
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,350
shortest path or or uh you know on a
Surface maybe I want to uh you know move

1586
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
Surface maybe I want to uh you know move
 

1587
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,230
Surface maybe I want to uh you know move
information in a way that's not too far

1588
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:35,240
information in a way that's not too far
 

1589
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,549
information in a way that's not too far
away but of course there's sort of many

1590
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:37,559
away but of course there's sort of many
 

1591
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,310
away but of course there's sort of many
variations on that theme when we talk

1592
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,320
variations on that theme when we talk
 

1593
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,470
variations on that theme when we talk
about uh shortest paths or even just

1594
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:41,480
about uh shortest paths or even just
 

1595
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,590
about uh shortest paths or even just
existence of a path right so these are

1596
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
existence of a path right so these are
 

1597
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,149
existence of a path right so these are
three sort of model problems that we

1598
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:45,159
three sort of model problems that we
 

1599
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,549
three sort of model problems that we
might solve on a graph right so the

1600
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:47,559
might solve on a graph right so the
 

1601
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,029
might solve on a graph right so the
first one uh which in this course we're

1602
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:50,039
first one uh which in this course we're
 

1603
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,509
first one uh which in this course we're
calling single pair reachability would

1604
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:52,519
calling single pair reachability would
 

1605
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,710
calling single pair reachability would
the idea that I take two vertices s and

1606
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
the idea that I take two vertices s and
 

1607
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,750
the idea that I take two vertices s and
t on my graph G and I ask you does there

1608
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:58,760
t on my graph G and I ask you does there
 

1609
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,909
t on my graph G and I ask you does there
exist a path between s and

1610
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:00,919
exist a path between s and
 

1611
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,269
exist a path between s and
t so what would be the sort of extreme

1612
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
t so what would be the sort of extreme
 

1613
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,389
t so what would be the sort of extreme
example where uh uh this gra this

1617
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,710

answer yes right like in somehow in our

1618
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:09,720
answer yes right like in somehow in our
 

1619
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,470
answer yes right like in somehow in our
head I think we think of all graphs as

1620
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:11,480
head I think we think of all graphs as
 

1621
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,310
head I think we think of all graphs as
being connected right but a perfectly

1622
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320
being connected right but a perfectly
 

1623
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,909
being connected right but a perfectly
valid graph the way we defined it would

1624
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
valid graph the way we defined it would
 

1625
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,630
valid graph the way we defined it would
be like 10 vertices and no

1626
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:17,640
be like 10 vertices and no
 

1627
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,630
be like 10 vertices and no
edges right this this function would be

1628
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
edges right this this function would be
 

1629
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,870
edges right this this function would be
very easy to code if that were the only

1630
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:21,880
very easy to code if that were the only
 

1631
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,310
very easy to code if that were the only
graph you ever cared about uh but but in

1632
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
graph you ever cared about uh but but in
 

1633
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,669
graph you ever cared about uh but but in
any event uh the existence of a path uh

1634
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:26,679
any event uh the existence of a path uh
 

1635
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:28,029
any event uh the existence of a path uh
is already a query that that takes a

1636
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:28,039
is already a query that that takes a
 

1637
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,190
is already a query that that takes a
little bit of algorithmic thinking we

1638
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
little bit of algorithmic thinking we
 

1639
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,470
little bit of algorithmic thinking we
haven't we haven't figured out how to do

1640
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
haven't we haven't figured out how to do
 

1641
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,149
haven't we haven't figured out how to do
that yet

1642
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:32,159
that yet

right now another problem we can solve

1644
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,320
right now another problem we can solve
 

1645
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,230
right now another problem we can solve
be the shortest path right given a graph

1646
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
be the shortest path right given a graph
 

1647
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,430
be the shortest path right given a graph
and two vertices we might say well how

1648
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:38,440
and two vertices we might say well how
 

1649
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,990
and two vertices we might say well how
far apart are these vertices in My Graph

1650
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,000
far apart are these vertices in My Graph
 

1651
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,750
far apart are these vertices in My Graph
uh if I I want to use the shortest

1652
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:42,760
uh if I I want to use the shortest
 

1653
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,590
uh if I I want to use the shortest
possible distance from one to the other

1654
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:45,600
possible distance from one to the other
 

1655
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,190

notice that I can use the second problem

1656
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200
notice that I can use the second problem
 

1657
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,470
notice that I can use the second problem
to solve the first one right because

1658
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:49,480
to solve the first one right because
 

1659
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,789
to solve the first one right because
what's the shortest the length of the

1660
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
what's the shortest the length of the
 

1661
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,230
what's the shortest the length of the
shortest path between two vertices that

1662
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,240
shortest path between two vertices that
 

1663
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,710
shortest path between two vertices that
don't have a path between

1664
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:54,720
don't have a path between

don't have a path between
them infinity or shrug that's actually a

1666
00:30:57,629 --> 00:30:57,639
them infinity or shrug that's actually a
 

1667
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,269
them infinity or shrug that's actually a
totally valid answer yeah um that's

1668
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:00,279
totally valid answer yeah um that's
 

1669
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:02,149
totally valid answer yeah um that's
right so how could I implement the

1670
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
right so how could I implement the
 

1671
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,710
right so how could I implement the
reachability code well I could call my

1672
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
reachability code well I could call my
 

1673
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,149
reachability code well I could call my
shortest path code and it gives me

1674
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
shortest path code and it gives me
 

1675
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,350
shortest path code and it gives me
Infinity then I return no it's not

1676
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,360
Infinity then I return no it's not
 

1677
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,629
Infinity then I return no it's not
reachable and if it gives me not

1678
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:09,639
reachable and if it gives me not
 

1679
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:12,870
reachable and if it gives me not
Infinity I return yes right so remember

1680
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
Infinity I return yes right so remember
 

1681
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,950
Infinity I return yes right so remember
that a key idea in algorithm's class is

1682
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:14,960
that a key idea in algorithm's class is
 

1683
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,590
that a key idea in algorithm's class is
this idea of reduction that I can like

1684
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:16,600
this idea of reduction that I can like
 

1685
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,990
this idea of reduction that I can like
use one function to solve another right

1686
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,000
use one function to solve another right
 

1687
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,909
use one function to solve another right
so in this case if we can solve shortest

1688
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:20,919
so in this case if we can solve shortest
 

1689
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,830
so in this case if we can solve shortest
path then we can certainly solve uh the

1690
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:22,840
path then we can certainly solve uh the
 

1691
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,509
path then we can certainly solve uh the
reachability problem by calling that

1692
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:24,519
reachability problem by calling that
 

1693
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,629
reachability problem by calling that
that piece of

1694
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:25,639
that piece of
 

1695
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:28,509
that piece of
code and then finally we could talk

1696
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:28,519
code and then finally we could talk
 

1697
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,789
code and then finally we could talk
about single Source shortest path so

1698
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:30,799
about single Source shortest path so
 

1699
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,669
about single Source shortest path so
notice now that there's only one input

1700
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:32,679
notice now that there's only one input
 

1701
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,110
notice now that there's only one input
node here

1702
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,120

1703
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,830
node here
s so what this problem is saying is give

1704
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:36,840
s so what this problem is saying is give
 

1705
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,389
s so what this problem is saying is give
me the length of the shortest path from

1706
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
me the length of the shortest path from
 

1707
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,710
me the length of the shortest path from
s to every single other vertex in my

1708
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:41,720

1709
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,950

second problem but at least it shows

1740
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:15,399
second problem but at least it shows
 

1741
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:17,789

that if I can solve problem three I can

1742
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:17,799
that if I can solve problem three I can
 

1743
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:20,269
that if I can solve problem three I can

00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:23,919
so uh in today's lecture we're just
 

1749
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,190
so uh in today's lecture we're just
going to worry about uh problem three in

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,190
going to worry about uh problem three in
other words these things are sort of

and and instead uh thought i' I'd draw a

1772
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:46,279
and and instead uh thought i' I'd draw a
 

1773
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,230
and and instead uh thought i' I'd draw a
picture on the

00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,240
picture on the
 

1775
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,870
picture on the
board so uh let's uh draw a

1776
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:51,880
board so uh let's uh draw a
 

1777
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,430
board so uh let's uh draw a
graph so here we have a a b I'm going to

1778
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:56,440
graph so here we have a a b I'm going to
 

1779
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,389

use letters instead of numbers to refer

1780
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,399
use letters instead of numbers to refer

1783
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,430

1788
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:08,639

I think it's pretty easy to guess what
it is right so clearly the shortest path

1818
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:36,840
it is right so clearly the shortest path
 

1819
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,590
it is right so clearly the shortest path
from a to a has length zero the shortest

you know so the next uh shortest path

1828
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
you know so the next uh shortest path
 

1829
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,870
you know so the next uh shortest path
has length three and then four like that

about that I might think about well how

1858
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:22,520
about that I might think about well how
 

1859
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,030
about that I might think about well how
do I even write down a data structure

1860
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,040
do I even write down a data structure
 

1861
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,990
do I even write down a data structure
that can store all of those paths right

1862
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
that can store all of those paths right
 

1863
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,950
that can store all of those paths right
well every po path could have like V

1864
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:29,960
well every po path could have like V
 

1865
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,430
well every po path could have like V
vertices in it right like it could be

00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:33,480
the for whatever reason my there's like

00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,829
the for whatever reason my there's like
a lot of branching in My Graph and all

1870
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:34,839
a lot of branching in My Graph and all
 

1871
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,109
a lot of branching in My Graph and all
the paths are super long actually I

1872
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119
the paths are super long actually I
 

1873
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,550
the paths are super long actually I
guess I have to think about whether

1874
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,560
guess I have to think about whether
 

1875
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,829
guess I have to think about whether
branching would make them them longer or

1876
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:39,839
branching would make them them longer or
 

1877
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,909
branching would make them them longer or
shorter uh but but in any

1878
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:41,919
shorter uh but but in any
 

1879
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,990
shorter uh but but in any
event I could have a really boring data

you know certainly most it takes all the

take v^ s space

1900
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
take v^ s space
 

1901
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,910
take v^ s space
total that wouldn't be so good right

space to do that um but the answer is

1916
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
space to do that um but the answer is
 

1917
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,230
space to do that um but the answer is
that we actually don't that we're going

1918
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
that we actually don't that we're going
 

1919
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,990
that we actually don't that we're going
to only need linear space and the idea

1920
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,000
to only need linear space and the idea
 

1921
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,589
to only need linear space and the idea
for that is to store an object called

1922
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:25,599
for that is to store an object called
 

1923
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,740
for that is to store an object called
the shortest path tree yes

1924
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,750
the shortest path tree yes
 

1925
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,670
the shortest path tree yes
[Music]

1926
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:34,680

 

1927
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,030

so the question was about recursion we

1928
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,040
so the question was about recursion we
 

1929
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,310
so the question was about recursion we
haven't actually written down any graph

1930
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:37,320
haven't actually written down any graph
 

1931
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,870
haven't actually written down any graph
algorithms so we're going to defer on

1932
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:38,880
algorithms so we're going to defer on
 

1933
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,150
algorithms so we're going to defer on
that and until until we actually recurse

1934
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,160
that and until until we actually recurse
 

1935
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,230
that and until until we actually recurse
uh and then we'll think about it more

1936
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
uh and then we'll think about it more
 

1937
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,589
uh and then we'll think about it more
carefully yeah but it's a totally

1938
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:44,599
carefully yeah but it's a totally
 

1939
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,790
carefully yeah but it's a totally
reasonable question there are plenty of

1940
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:45,800
reasonable question there are plenty of
 

1941
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,910
reasonable question there are plenty of
recursive graph algorithms out there uh

1942
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:47,920
recursive graph algorithms out there uh
 

1943
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,950
recursive graph algorithms out there uh
and and and then we'll have to uh do our

1944
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:49,960
and and and then we'll have to uh do our
 

1945
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,630
and and and then we'll have to uh do our
our accounting very carefully for

1946
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:53,640

 

1947
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,030

sure right so uh instead uh we're going

1948
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040
sure right so uh instead uh we're going
 

1949
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,430
sure right so uh instead uh we're going
to Define an object called the shortest

1950
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:58,440
to Define an object called the shortest
 

1951
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,309
to Define an object called the shortest
path tree and the basic trick here is to

1952
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:01,319
path tree and the basic trick here is to
 

1953
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:03,710
path tree and the basic trick here is to
say well how did I get from a to

1954
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:03,720
say well how did I get from a to
 

1955
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,990
say well how did I get from a to
c well there's always a Vertex which is

1956
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,000
c well there's always a Vertex which is
 

1957
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,950
c well there's always a Vertex which is
its

1958
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:07,960
its
 

1959
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,270
its
predecessor on the shortest path and

1960
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:10,280
predecessor on the shortest path and
 

1961
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,390
predecessor on the shortest path and
shortest paths have this really

1962
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:11,400
shortest paths have this really
 

1963
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,230
shortest paths have this really
beautiful property right which is that

1964
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,240
beautiful property right which is that
 

1965
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,390
beautiful property right which is that
the shortest path from a to c if I

1966
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,400
the shortest path from a to c if I
 

1967
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,190
the shortest path from a to c if I
truncate it right so like it goes A to B

1968
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,200
truncate it right so like it goes A to B
 

1969
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,109
truncate it right so like it goes A to B
to

1970
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
to
 

1971
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,470
to
C then the truncated one is also the

1972
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:22,480
C then the truncated one is also the
 

1973
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,710
C then the truncated one is also the
shortest path to that previous vertex

1974
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:24,720
shortest path to that previous vertex
 

1975
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,829
shortest path to that previous vertex
right so so let's think about that a

1976
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
right so so let's think about that a
 

1977
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,230
right so so let's think about that a
little bit because that sentence was as

1978
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,240
little bit because that sentence was as
 

1979
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,790
little bit because that sentence was as
usual poorly phrased by your instructor

1980
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:29,800
usual poorly phrased by your instructor
 

1981
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,870
usual poorly phrased by your instructor
so let's say that I have the shortest

1982
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:31,880
so let's say that I have the shortest
 

1983
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,870
so let's say that I have the shortest
path from a to d which is is is very

1984
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:33,880
path from a to d which is is is very
 

1985
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,790
path from a to d which is is is very
clearly A B C

1986
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:37,800
clearly A B C
 

1987
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,270
clearly A B C
D I think we can all agree and now I

1988
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
D I think we can all agree and now I
 

1989
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,150
D I think we can all agree and now I
take like this subl list I just look

1990
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,160
take like this subl list I just look
 

1991
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,309
take like this subl list I just look
from a to

from a to
c is there ever a circumstance when this

1994
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,240
c is there ever a circumstance when this
 

1995
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,390
c is there ever a circumstance when this
is not the shortest path or a shortest

1996
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,400

1997
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,349

1999
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,390

c no right because if it were right if

2000
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:55,400
c no right because if it were right if
 

2001
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,829
c no right because if it were right if
there existed a shorter path from a to c

2002
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:57,839
there existed a shorter path from a to c
 

2003
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,309
there existed a shorter path from a to c
I could like splice it in here and find

00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:00,319
I could like splice it in here and find
 

2005
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,069
I could like splice it in here and find
a shortest path from a to

00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,079
a shortest path from a to
 

2007
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,670
a shortest path from a to
d you see that so based on that

2008
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
d you see that so based on that
 

2009
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,950
d you see that so based on that
reasoning rather than storing like this

2010
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:07,960
reasoning rather than storing like this
 

2011
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,430
reasoning rather than storing like this
giant set of shortest paths sort of

00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:10,440
giant set of shortest paths sort of

I can just think of the one vertex

2018
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:17,800
I can just think of the one vertex
 

2019
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,030
I can just think of the one vertex
that's before me in my shortest path I'm

2020
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,040
that's before me in my shortest path I'm
 

2021
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,750
that's before me in my shortest path I'm
going to trace backwards so let's take a

2022
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:21,760
going to trace backwards so let's take a
 

2023
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,870
going to trace backwards so let's take a
look at our graph

2024
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880

 

2025
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,230

here essentially the object to keep

2026
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,240
here essentially the object to keep
 

2027
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,829
here essentially the object to keep
track of of is like a

2028
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:28,839
track of of is like a
 

2029
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:30,990
track of of is like a
predecessor right

2030
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,000
predecessor right
 

2031
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,550
predecessor right
so what is the predecessor of f on the

2032
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:33,560
so what is the predecessor of f on the
 

2033
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,230
so what is the predecessor of f on the
shortest path it's actually either D or

2034
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,240
shortest path it's actually either D or
 

2035
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,309
shortest path it's actually either D or
E it doesn't matter in this case so

2036
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:37,319
E it doesn't matter in this case so
 

2037
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:41,670
E it doesn't matter in this case so
maybe the the predecessor is e for fun

2038
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
maybe the the predecessor is e for fun
 

2039
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,150
maybe the the predecessor is e for fun
right what's the predecessor of e well

2040
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
right what's the predecessor of e well
 

2041
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,430
right what's the predecessor of e well
clearly the previous Edge or vertex on

2042
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:46,440
clearly the previous Edge or vertex on
 

2043
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,270
clearly the previous Edge or vertex on
the shortest path is

2044
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:48,280
the shortest path is
 

2045
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,109
the shortest path is
C similarly for D now we have b and

2046
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
C similarly for D now we have b and
 

2047
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,390
C similarly for D now we have b and
a have a bunch of arrows that point this

2048
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:55,400
a have a bunch of arrows that point this
 

2049
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,910
a have a bunch of arrows that point this
way right so for every vert I'm just

2050
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:57,920
way right so for every vert I'm just
 

2051
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,510
way right so for every vert I'm just
going to St an arrow pointing toward the

2052
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,520
going to St an arrow pointing toward the
 

2053
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,270
going to St an arrow pointing toward the
previous vertex on the shortest path I'm

2054
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,280
previous vertex on the shortest path I'm
 

2055
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,589
previous vertex on the shortest path I'm
not going to store the whole shortest

2056
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:02,599
not going to store the whole shortest
 

2057
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:05,270
not going to store the whole shortest
path just the very last

2058
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,280
path just the very last
 

2059
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,430
path just the very last
Edge so first of all how much storage

2060
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440
Edge so first of all how much storage
 

2061
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,309
Edge so first of all how much storage
does this

2062
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:09,319
does this
 

2063
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:12,390
does this
take takes V Space do you see that or

2064
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
take takes V Space do you see that or
 

2065
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,550
take takes V Space do you see that or
the size of the vertices space because

2066
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:14,560
the size of the vertices space because
 

2067
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,390
the size of the vertices space because
every vertex just has to store one thing

2068
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,400
every vertex just has to store one thing
 

2069
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,710
every vertex just has to store one thing
which is the previous vertex on its

2070
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:17,720
which is the previous vertex on its
 

2071
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,230
which is the previous vertex on its
shortest path yeah now what is my

2072
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,240
shortest path yeah now what is my
 

2073
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,790
shortest path yeah now what is my
algorithm for tracing shortest paths

2074
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
algorithm for tracing shortest paths
 

2075
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,190
algorithm for tracing shortest paths
it's really simple right I just start

2076
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,200
it's really simple right I just start
 

2077
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,270
it's really simple right I just start
walking along these edges all the way

2078
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:26,280
walking along these edges all the way
 

2079
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,230
walking along these edges all the way
until I get back to a

2080
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,240
until I get back to a
 

2081
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,630
until I get back to a
now this object is called as shortest

2082
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,640
now this object is called as shortest
 

2083
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,349
now this object is called as shortest
path tree notice I snuck in one

2084
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:32,359
path tree notice I snuck in one
 

2085
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:34,109
path tree notice I snuck in one
additional word which is

2086
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:34,119
additional word which is
 

2087
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:36,470
additional word which is
tree why is that can I ever have a cycle

2088
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
tree why is that can I ever have a cycle
 

2089
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,150
tree why is that can I ever have a cycle
in this

2090
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
in this
 

2091
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,109
in this
graph wouldn't really make any sense

2092
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:40,119
graph wouldn't really make any sense
 

2093
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,390
graph wouldn't really make any sense
right these are shortest paths you

2094
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:41,400
right these are shortest paths you
 

2095
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,470
right these are shortest paths you
should be able to kind of follow the

2096
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,480
should be able to kind of follow the
 

2097
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,670
should be able to kind of follow the
gradient back to the uh original uh

2098
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:45,680
gradient back to the uh original uh
 

2099
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,349
gradient back to the uh original uh
vertex okay so in other words uh I'm

2100
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:48,359
vertex okay so in other words uh I'm
 

2101
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,550
vertex okay so in other words uh I'm
going to basically decorate my graph

2102
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:51,560
going to basically decorate my graph
 

2103
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,990
going to basically decorate my graph
with one additional thing we'll call it

2104
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,000
with one additional thing we'll call it
 

2105
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,109
with one additional thing we'll call it
P of V which is the previous vertex on

00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:56,119
P of V which is the previous vertex on
 

2107
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:58,109
P of V which is the previous vertex on
the shortest path from my source point

V and what I think I've I've tried to

2112
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:02,240
V and what I think I've I've tried to
 

2113
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,630
V and what I think I've I've tried to
argue to you guys today is that if I

2114
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:03,640
argue to you guys today is that if I
 

2115
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,870
argue to you guys today is that if I
have this information that's actually

2116
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
have this information that's actually
 

2117
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,670
have this information that's actually
enough to reconstruct the shortest path

2118
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:06,680
enough to reconstruct the shortest path
 

2119
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,230
enough to reconstruct the shortest path
I just keep you know taking P of v and

2120
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,240
I just keep you know taking P of v and
 

2121
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,069
I just keep you know taking P of v and
then P of P of v and then P of P of P of

2122
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:11,079
then P of P of v and then P of P of P of
 

2123
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,510
then P of P of v and then P of P of P of
v and so on which sounds more

2124
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:12,520
v and so on which sounds more
 

2125
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,910
v and so on which sounds more
complicated than it is uh until I I

2126
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:14,920
complicated than it is uh until I I
 

2127
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,069
complicated than it is uh until I I
trace back to my original vertex and

2128
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:17,079
trace back to my original vertex and

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,150
about
that yes

2136
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,160

 

2137
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:36,150

I had an edge I connected a to d

2138
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,160

 

2139
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,910

okay ah okay so the question was let's

2140
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
okay ah okay so the question was let's
 

2141
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,510
okay ah okay so the question was let's
say that uh our colleague here added an

2142
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
say that uh our colleague here added an
 

2143
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,790
say that uh our colleague here added an
edge this is a great

2144
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:46,800
edge this is a great
 

2145
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,550
edge this is a great
question you know somebody was evil like

2146
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:49,560
question you know somebody was evil like
 

2147
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,069
question you know somebody was evil like
my adversarial neural network STI an

2148
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:52,079
my adversarial neural network STI an
 

2149
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,790
my adversarial neural network STI an
edge here because it was adversarial and

2150
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:53,800
edge here because it was adversarial and
 

2151
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,470
edge here because it was adversarial and
it wanted my shortest path code to fail

2152
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:56,480
it wanted my shortest path code to fail
 

2153
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,829
it wanted my shortest path code to fail
and now somehow the the tree that I gave

2154
00:39:58,829 --> 00:39:58,839
and now somehow the the tree that I gave
 

2155
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,550
and now somehow the the tree that I gave
you is is no longer correct and my

2156
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:01,560
you is is no longer correct and my
 

2157
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,390
you is is no longer correct and my
answer to that is yes why is that well

2158
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,400
answer to that is yes why is that well
 

2159
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,790
answer to that is yes why is that well
by adding this edge here my the length

2160
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
by adding this edge here my the length
 

2161
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,349
by adding this edge here my the length
of my shortest path changed right the

2162
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:08,359
of my shortest path changed right the
 

2163
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:10,870
of my shortest path changed right the
the shortest path from a to d is now one

2164
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:10,880
the shortest path from a to d is now one
 

2165
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,470
the shortest path from a to d is now one
so this tree is no longer valid I need a

2166
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
so this tree is no longer valid I need a
 

2167
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,150
so this tree is no longer valid I need a
new tree so now what would be the uh the

2168
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
new tree so now what would be the uh the
 

2169
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,230
new tree so now what would be the uh the
previous like P of of of D here well

2170
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:19,240
previous like P of of of D here well
 

2171
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,790
previous like P of of of D here well
rather than being C it would be

2172
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:21,800
rather than being C it would be
 

2173
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,430
rather than being C it would be
a yeah so that's absolutely right and it

2174
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:24,440
a yeah so that's absolutely right and it
 

2175
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,630
a yeah so that's absolutely right and it
actually is reflective of an really

2176
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:26,640
actually is reflective of an really
 

2177
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,069
actually is reflective of an really
annoying proper property of shortest

2178
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
annoying proper property of shortest
 

2179
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,430
annoying proper property of shortest
paths which is if I add one Edge to My

2180
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:30,440
paths which is if I add one Edge to My
 

2181
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,470
paths which is if I add one Edge to My
Graph the length of the shortest path to

00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
Graph the length of the shortest path to
 

2183
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,750
Graph the length of the shortest path to
every vertex can change well I guess

2184
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:34,760
every vertex can change well I guess
 

2185
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,510
every vertex can change well I guess
with the the exception of the source

2186
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:36,520
with the the exception of the source
 

2187
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,510
with the the exception of the source
vertex yeah uh and and uh that's

2188
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
vertex yeah uh and and uh that's
 

2189
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,150
vertex yeah uh and and uh that's
actually a really big headache in

2190
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:41,160
actually a really big headache in
 

2191
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,510
actually a really big headache in
certain applications so uh for instance

2192
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:43,520
certain applications so uh for instance
 

2193
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,910
certain applications so uh for instance
and then I'll shut up about applications

2194
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:44,920
and then I'll shut up about applications
 

2195
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,550
and then I'll shut up about applications
and and do math again um I work a lot

2196
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:47,560
and and do math again um I work a lot
 

2197
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,470
and and do math again um I work a lot
with 3D models and there's a big data

2198
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:49,480
with 3D models and there's a big data
 

2199
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,790
with 3D models and there's a big data
set of 3D models of like ballerinas and

2200
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:51,800
set of 3D models of like ballerinas and
 

2201
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,109
set of 3D models of like ballerinas and
ballerinas are really annoying because

2202
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:53,119
ballerinas are really annoying because
 

2203
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,069
ballerinas are really annoying because
sometimes they put their hands together

2204
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:54,079
sometimes they put their hands together
 

2205
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,710
sometimes they put their hands together
like that and then suddenly the shortest

2206
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
like that and then suddenly the shortest
 

2207
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,230
like that and then suddenly the shortest
path between your fingers goes from like

2208
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,240
path between your fingers goes from like
 

2209
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,630
path between your fingers goes from like
your entire body to like zero and so

2210
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:03,640
your entire body to like zero and so
 

2211
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,030
your entire body to like zero and so
incremental algorithms for computing

2212
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
incremental algorithms for computing
 

2213
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,950
incremental algorithms for computing
shortest path can can fail here right

2214
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
shortest path can can fail here right
 

2215
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,790
shortest path can can fail here right
because I have to update like everything

2216
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
because I have to update like everything
 

2217
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,550
because I have to update like everything
if I accidentally glued together uh

2218
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
if I accidentally glued together uh
 

2219
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,950
if I accidentally glued together uh
fingers like that yeah um so anyway I'll

2220
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
fingers like that yeah um so anyway I'll
 

2221
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,990
fingers like that yeah um so anyway I'll
let you think about how you might fix

2222
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,000
let you think about how you might fix
 

2223
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,349
let you think about how you might fix
that problem and if you if you want to

2224
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
that problem and if you if you want to
 

2225
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,550
that problem and if you if you want to
know more you should take 683a

2226
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:19,560
know more you should take 683a
 

2227
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,829
know more you should take 683a
yes if you change your Source node the

2228
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:21,839
yes if you change your Source node the
 

2229
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,430
yes if you change your Source node the
shortest paths would change again yeah

2230
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
shortest paths would change again yeah
 

2231
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,510
shortest paths would change again yeah
so this is going to be one of these

2232
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:24,520
so this is going to be one of these
 

2233
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,750
so this is going to be one of these
really boring things I'm going to keep

2234
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:25,760
really boring things I'm going to keep
 

2235
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,790
really boring things I'm going to keep
answering like anytime I Chang anything

2236
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:27,800
answering like anytime I Chang anything
 

2237
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,589
answering like anytime I Chang anything
about my problem I changed my source I

2238
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
about my problem I changed my source I
 

2239
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,790
about my problem I changed my source I
changed my edges I have to just

2240
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:30,800
changed my edges I have to just
 

2241
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,550
changed my edges I have to just
recompute all the shortest paths there

2242
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
recompute all the shortest paths there
 

2243
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,069
recompute all the shortest paths there
are obviously algorithms out there that

2244
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
are obviously algorithms out there that
 

2245
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,950
are obviously algorithms out there that
don't do that uh but we're not going to

2246
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
don't do that uh but we're not going to
 

2247
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,470
don't do that uh but we're not going to
think about them yet okay so as usual

2248
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:40,480
think about them yet okay so as usual
 

2249
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,750
think about them yet okay so as usual
I've talked too much and left myself

2250
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
I've talked too much and left myself
 

2251
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,589
I've talked too much and left myself
about 10 minutes to uh do the actual

2252
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:43,599
about 10 minutes to uh do the actual
 

2253
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,430
about 10 minutes to uh do the actual
algorithm that's interesting uh in in

2254
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,440
algorithm that's interesting uh in in
 

2255
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,470
algorithm that's interesting uh in in
the lecture here although actually it's

2256
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:47,480
the lecture here although actually it's
 

2257
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,750
the lecture here although actually it's
really not so complicated so I think

2258
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:48,760
really not so complicated so I think
 

2259
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,750
really not so complicated so I think
we'll we'll do okay which is how do I

2260
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:50,760
we'll we'll do okay which is how do I
 

2261
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,910
we'll we'll do okay which is how do I
actually compute chtis paths yeah and

2262
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:52,920
actually compute chtis paths yeah and
 

2263
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,550
actually compute chtis paths yeah and
the basic thing we're going to do is is

2264
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:54,560
the basic thing we're going to do is is
 

2265
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,710
the basic thing we're going to do is is
sort of build on this this tree analogy

2266
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:56,720
sort of build on this this tree analogy
 

2267
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,510
sort of build on this this tree analogy
here we're going to Define one more

2268
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:58,520
here we're going to Define one more
 

2269
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,390
here we're going to Define one more
object which I really like actually I I

2270
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:00,400
object which I really like actually I I
 

2271
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,710
object which I really like actually I I
enjoy this from from Jason's notes

2272
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:01,720
enjoy this from from Jason's notes
 

2273
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,230
enjoy this from from Jason's notes
because it looks like calculus and I I

2274
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:03,240
because it looks like calculus and I I
 

2275
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,470
because it looks like calculus and I I
enjoy that um and and that's uh an idea

2276
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
enjoy that um and and that's uh an idea
 

2277
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,430
enjoy that um and and that's uh an idea
of a level set and so this is a whole

2278
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
of a level set and so this is a whole
 

2279
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,829
of a level set and so this is a whole
set of things L subk and these are all

2280
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:11,839
set of things L subk and these are all
 

2281
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,910
set of things L subk and these are all
the vertices that are distance K away

2282
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,920
the vertices that are distance K away
 

2283
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,589
the vertices that are distance K away
from my source right so for instance if

2284
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:16,599
from my source right so for instance if
 

2285
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,750
from my source right so for instance if
my source vertex in in this example is

2286
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:18,760
my source vertex in in this example is
 

2287
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,630
my source vertex in in this example is
the vertex all the way on the left then

2288
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:20,640
the vertex all the way on the left then
 

2289
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,950
the vertex all the way on the left then
l0 obviously contains just that vertex

2290
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:23,960
l0 obviously contains just that vertex
 

2291
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,109
l0 obviously contains just that vertex
right L1 is the the next one L2 is the

2292
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:26,119
right L1 is the the next one L2 is the
 

2293
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:29,870
right L1 is the the next one L2 is the
third one but now L3 is a set of three

2294
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:29,880
third one but now L3 is a set of three
 

2295
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,829
third one but now L3 is a set of three
vertices right because those are all the

2296
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:31,839
vertices right because those are all the
 

2297
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,309
vertices right because those are all the
things that are distanced three away

2298
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:33,319
things that are distanced three away
 

2299
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:34,750
things that are distanced three away
from the source that's what i' I've

2300
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:34,760
from the source that's what i' I've
 

2301
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,270
from the source that's what i' I've
labeled in pink here okay so that's all

2302
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:37,280
labeled in pink here okay so that's all
 

2303
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,230
labeled in pink here okay so that's all
that this uh this notation uh here means

2304
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,240
that this uh this notation uh here means
 

2305
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,710
that this uh this notation uh here means
oh oops I've made a slight typo because

2306
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:41,720
oh oops I've made a slight typo because
 

2307
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,589
oh oops I've made a slight typo because
in this class distance is Delta and not

2308
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:43,599
in this class distance is Delta and not
 

2309
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,270
in this class distance is Delta and not
D but whatever the shortest distance the

2310
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,280
D but whatever the shortest distance the
 

2311
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,790
D but whatever the shortest distance the
shortest distance that's absolutely

2312
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
shortest distance that's absolutely
 

2313
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,190
shortest distance that's absolutely
right so for instance I could have a

2314
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:50,200
right so for instance I could have a
 

2315
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,390
right so for instance I could have a
very long distance from l0 to L1 right I

2316
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:52,400
very long distance from l0 to L1 right I
 

2317
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,950
very long distance from l0 to L1 right I
could just flip back and forth between

2318
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:53,960
could just flip back and forth between
 

2319
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,109
could just flip back and forth between
l0 and L1 maybe go over to L4 and then

2320
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:56,119
l0 and L1 maybe go over to L4 and then
 

2321
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,910
l0 and L1 maybe go over to L4 and then
go back uh that that wouldn't be a

2322
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:57,920
go back uh that that wouldn't be a
 

2323
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,309
go back uh that that wouldn't be a
terribly helpful thing to compute that's

2324
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:00,319
terribly helpful thing to compute that's
 

2325
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,349
terribly helpful thing to compute that's
absolutely right

2326
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:03,359

 

2327
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,150

yes ah the red background is the set l

2328
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:07,160
yes ah the red background is the set l
 

2329
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,630
yes ah the red background is the set l
so for example L3 contains these three

2330
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:09,640
so for example L3 contains these three
 

2331
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,790
so for example L3 contains these three
vertices because they all the things

2332
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:11,800
vertices because they all the things
 

2333
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,470
vertices because they all the things
that are distance three away from the

2334
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:13,480
that are distance three away from the
 

2335
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,670
that are distance three away from the
left I got a little too slick drawing my

2336
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,680
left I got a little too slick drawing my
 

2337
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,030
left I got a little too slick drawing my
uh my diagram like late last night I'm

2338
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,040
uh my diagram like late last night I'm
 

2339
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,109
uh my diagram like late last night I'm
kind of proud of it

2340
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:21,119
kind of proud of it
 

2341
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,790
kind of proud of it
okay so essentially if I wanted to

2342
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:23,800
okay so essentially if I wanted to
 

2343
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,470
okay so essentially if I wanted to
compute the length of the shortest path

2344
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:25,480
compute the length of the shortest path
 

2345
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,510
compute the length of the shortest path
from vertex all the way on the left to

2346
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:27,520
from vertex all the way on the left to
 

2347
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,470
from vertex all the way on the left to
all the other

2348
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:28,480
all the other
 

2349
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,549
all the other
vertices um one way to do that would be

2350
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:30,559
vertices um one way to do that would be
 

2351
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,030
vertices um one way to do that would be
to compute all these level sets and then

2352
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,040
to compute all these level sets and then
 

2353
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,950
to compute all these level sets and then
just sort of check what level set I'm in

2354
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:33,960
just sort of check what level set I'm in
 

2355
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,390
just sort of check what level set I'm in
right uh so we're going to introduce an

2356
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:36,400
right uh so we're going to introduce an
 

2357
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,190
right uh so we're going to introduce an
algorithm called breath ver search which

2358
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
algorithm called breath ver search which
 

2359
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,030
algorithm called breath ver search which
does roughly uh that so uh breath ver

2360
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:42,040
does roughly uh that so uh breath ver
 

2361
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,910
does roughly uh that so uh breath ver
search the way we'll introduce it today

2362
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:43,920
search the way we'll introduce it today
 

2363
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,950
search the way we'll introduce it today
uh is going to be an algorithm for

2364
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:44,960
uh is going to be an algorithm for
 

2365
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,710
uh is going to be an algorithm for
computing all of those level sets L subi

2366
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:47,720
computing all of those level sets L subi
 

2367
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,109
computing all of those level sets L subi
uh and then from that we can construct

2368
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:49,119
uh and then from that we can construct
 

2369
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,870
uh and then from that we can construct
the length and and even the uh the shape

2370
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:50,880
the length and and even the uh the shape
 

2371
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,829
the length and and even the uh the shape
of the uh the shortest path so now I'm

2372
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:52,839
of the uh the shortest path so now I'm
 

2373
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,549
of the uh the shortest path so now I'm
going to move to my handwritten

2374
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:54,559
going to move to my handwritten
 

2375
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,230
going to move to my handwritten
notes okay

2376
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:57,240
notes okay
 

2377
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,270
notes okay
and here's what our algorithm is going

2378
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:58,280
and here's what our algorithm is going
 

2379
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,950
and here's what our algorithm is going
to

2380
00:43:59,950 --> 00:43:59,960
to
 

2381
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,069
to
do I'm going to write it in a slightly

2382
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
do I'm going to write it in a slightly
 

2383
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,309
do I'm going to write it in a slightly
different way than what's in the course

2384
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:03,319
different way than what's in the course
 

2385
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:04,750
different way than what's in the course
notes and on the screen but but only

2386
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:04,760
notes and on the screen but but only
 

2387
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,750
notes and on the screen but but only
slightly um so first of all one thing I

2388
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:08,760
slightly um so first of all one thing I
 

2389
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,030
slightly um so first of all one thing I
think we can all agree on is that level

2390
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,040
think we can all agree on is that level
 

2391
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,990
think we can all agree on is that level
set zero oh that's cool this chalk

2392
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
set zero oh that's cool this chalk
 

2393
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,510
set zero oh that's cool this chalk
bifurcated uh it contains one node what

2394
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:17,520
bifurcated uh it contains one node what
 

2395
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,589
bifurcated uh it contains one node what
should that node be the source right

2396
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:20,599
should that node be the source right
 

2397
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:21,829
should that node be the source right
because the only thing that's distance

2398
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
because the only thing that's distance
 

2399
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,589
because the only thing that's distance
away zero away from the source is the

2400
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
away zero away from the source is the
 

2401
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,030
away zero away from the source is the
source node yeah

2402
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040

 

2403
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,190

okay uh and uh in addition to that we

2404
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,200
okay uh and uh in addition to that we
 

2405
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,710
okay uh and uh in addition to that we
can initialize the distance from the

2406
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:33,720
can initialize the distance from the
 

2407
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,870
can initialize the distance from the
source to

2408
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
source to
 

2409
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,069
source to
itself everybody on three what is the

2410
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:37,079
itself everybody on three what is the
 

2411
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,150
itself everybody on three what is the
distance from the source to itself 1 two

2412
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:39,160
distance from the source to itself 1 two
 

2413
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,710
distance from the source to itself 1 two
three zero thank you see you're waking

2414
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:41,720
three zero thank you see you're waking
 

2415
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,829
three zero thank you see you're waking
up now it's it's getting it's almost 11

2416
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
up now it's it's getting it's almost 11
 

2417
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,230
up now it's it's getting it's almost 11
12 what time is it almost 12 okay and

2418
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:47,240
12 what time is it almost 12 okay and
 

2419
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,390
12 what time is it almost 12 okay and
then finally uh well maybe initially we

2420
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:50,400
then finally uh well maybe initially we
 

2421
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,510
then finally uh well maybe initially we
don't really know anything about the

2422
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,520
don't really know anything about the
 

2423
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,109
don't really know anything about the
array P so we just make it empty right

2424
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:54,119
array P so we just make it empty right
 

2425
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,390
array P so we just make it empty right
cuz P of of the source is somehow

2426
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
cuz P of of the source is somehow
 

2427
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,470
cuz P of of the source is somehow
doesn't matter right because once I've

2428
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:57,480
doesn't matter right because once I've
 

2429
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,910
doesn't matter right because once I've
made it back to the source I'm I'm done

2430
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:58,920
made it back to the source I'm I'm done
 

2431
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,109
made it back to the source I'm I'm done
Computing shortest paths so we're going

2432
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
Computing shortest paths so we're going
 

2433
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,670
Computing shortest paths so we're going
to write an algorithm that computes all

2434
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:02,680
to write an algorithm that computes all
 

2435
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,750
to write an algorithm that computes all
the level sets and fills in this array p

2436
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:05,760
the level sets and fills in this array p
 

2437
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,710
the level sets and fills in this array p
and fills in the distances all in one

2438
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:07,720
and fills in the distances all in one
 

2439
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,069
and fills in the distances all in one
big shot we're going to call it breath

2440
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:09,079
big shot we're going to call it breath
 

2441
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,190
big shot we're going to call it breath
first

2442
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:10,200
first
 

2443
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,750
first
search Okay so let's do

2444
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:14,760

 

2445
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,950

that so we can use the notation uh here

2446
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:17,960
that so we can use the notation uh here
 

2447
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,190
that so we can use the notation uh here
and notice that there's basically an

2448
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,200
and notice that there's basically an
 

2449
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,829
and notice that there's basically an
induction going on right which is I'm

2450
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:20,839
induction going on right which is I'm
 

2451
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:22,470
induction going on right which is I'm
going to compute level set one from

2452
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:22,480
going to compute level set one from
 

2453
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,990
going to compute level set one from
Level set zero level set two from Level

2454
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,000
Level set zero level set two from Level
 

2455
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,190
Level set zero level set two from Level
set one and so on until I filled in My

2456
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:27,200
set one and so on until I filled in My
 

2457
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,950
set one and so on until I filled in My
Level sets does that make sense uh so uh

2458
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:30,960
Level sets does that make sense uh so uh
 

2459
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,710
Level sets does that make sense uh so uh
here's a slightly different way to uh

2460
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:32,720
here's a slightly different way to uh
 

2461
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,750
here's a slightly different way to uh
notate the same thing I'm going to use a

2462
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:34,760
notate the same thing I'm going to use a
 

2463
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,349
notate the same thing I'm going to use a
while loop which I know is like slightly

2464
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:36,359
while loop which I know is like slightly
 

2465
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,670
while loop which I know is like slightly
non- kosher uh but that's okay um so I'm

2466
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:39,680
non- kosher uh but that's okay um so I'm
 

2467
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,630
non- kosher uh but that's okay um so I'm
going to initialize a number I to be one

2468
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:42,640
going to initialize a number I to be one
 

2469
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,670
going to initialize a number I to be one
this is going to be like our counter I'm

2470
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:44,680
this is going to be like our counter I'm
 

2471
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,630
this is going to be like our counter I'm
going to

2472
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:45,640
going to
 

2473
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,870
going to
say

2474
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:47,880
say
 

2475
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,630
say
while the

2476
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:50,640
while the
 

2477
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,030
while the
previous uh level set is not empty

2478
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:54,040
previous uh level set is not empty
 

2479
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,109
previous uh level set is not empty
meaning that potentially there's a path

2480
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:56,119
meaning that potentially there's a path
 

2481
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:57,950
meaning that potentially there's a path
that goes through the previous level set

2482
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:57,960
that goes through the previous level set
 

2483
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,150
that goes through the previous level set
into the next one right because as soon

2484
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:00,160
into the next one right because as soon
 

2485
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,270
into the next one right because as soon
as one of my My Level set is empty

2486
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:02,280
as one of my My Level set is empty
 

2487
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,470
as one of my My Level set is empty
notice that all the like the LI for even

2488
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,480
notice that all the like the LI for even
 

2489
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,069
notice that all the like the LI for even
bigger I are also going to be empty

2490
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:06,079
bigger I are also going to be empty
 

2491
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,309
bigger I are also going to be empty
there's like never a case when there's

2492
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:07,319
there's like never a case when there's
 

2493
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:09,549
there's like never a case when there's
something distance not distance I but

2494
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:09,559
something distance not distance I but
 

2495
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,309
something distance not distance I but
then distance like i+

2496
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:11,319
then distance like i+
 

2497
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:16,870
then distance like i+
5 okay so now what am I going to do well

2498
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
5 okay so now what am I going to do well
 

2499
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,829
5 okay so now what am I going to do well
let's think back to our

2500
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:21,839

 

2501
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,309

graph right so like now I know that this

2502
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
graph right so like now I know that this
 

2503
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,390
graph right so like now I know that this
guy is distance zero away that's what I

2504
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:26,400
guy is distance zero away that's what I
 

2505
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,950
guy is distance zero away that's what I
started with

2506
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:27,960
started with
 

2507
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,190
started with
so now I'm going to look at all the

2508
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
so now I'm going to look at all the
 

2509
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,230
so now I'm going to look at all the
neighbors of this vertex I'm going to

2510
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:31,240
neighbors of this vertex I'm going to
 

2511
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,589
neighbors of this vertex I'm going to
make them distance one away that make

2512
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:34,599
make them distance one away that make
 

2513
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:36,870
make them distance one away that make
sense and similarly here this guy's

2514
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:36,880
sense and similarly here this guy's
 

2515
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,870
sense and similarly here this guy's
distance

2516
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:37,880
distance
 

2517
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,870
distance
too and eventually I'm going to get in

2518
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:39,880
too and eventually I'm going to get in
 

2519
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,390
too and eventually I'm going to get in
trouble because

2520
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:41,400
trouble because
 

2521
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,390
trouble because
maybe well what's a good example here I

2522
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:44,400
maybe well what's a good example here I
 

2523
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,710
maybe well what's a good example here I
won't even try to draw uh I could run

2524
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,720
won't even try to draw uh I could run
 

2525
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,430
won't even try to draw uh I could run
into trouble if I don't want to add a

2526
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:48,440
into trouble if I don't want to add a
 

2527
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,510
into trouble if I don't want to add a
Vertex twice to two different level sets

2528
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:51,520
Vertex twice to two different level sets
 

2529
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,750
Vertex twice to two different level sets
right once I've I've put it in Li then I

2530
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
right once I've I've put it in Li then I
 

2531
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,670
right once I've I've put it in Li then I
don't want to put it in like Li I + 5

2532
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,680
don't want to put it in like Li I + 5
 

2533
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,950
don't want to put it in like Li I + 5
because I already know that it's just

2534
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
because I already know that it's just
 

2535
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,270
because I already know that it's just
since eye away does that make

2536
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,280
since eye away does that make
 

2537
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,710
since eye away does that make
sense okay so what I'm going to do is

2538
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:01,720
sense okay so what I'm going to do is
 

2539
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,349
sense okay so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to iterate over all the

2540
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:03,359
I'm going to iterate over all the
 

2541
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:08,750
I'm going to iterate over all the
vertices in my previous level

2542
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:08,760

 

2543
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,630

set and now I'm going to look at every

2544
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:11,640
set and now I'm going to look at every
 

2545
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,790
set and now I'm going to look at every
vertex that is adjacent to you because

2546
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:15,800
vertex that is adjacent to you because
 

2547
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,190
vertex that is adjacent to you because
what do I know I know that if I can get

2548
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,200
what do I know I know that if I can get
 

2549
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,109
what do I know I know that if I can get
to U in I minus one steps how many steps

2550
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:20,119
to U in I minus one steps how many steps
 

2551
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:21,870
to U in I minus one steps how many steps
should it take me to get to any neighbor

2552
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:21,880
should it take me to get to any neighbor
 

2553
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,309
should it take me to get to any neighbor
of

2554
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:23,319
of
 

2555
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:25,790
of
you ey steps right because I can go

2556
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:25,800
you ey steps right because I can go
 

2557
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,270
you ey steps right because I can go
through the path which is length IUS one

2558
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:28,280
through the path which is length IUS one
 

2559
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,870
through the path which is length IUS one
add one additional Edge and now get to

2560
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:30,880
add one additional Edge and now get to
 

2561
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,990
add one additional Edge and now get to
that new guy right so what can I do I

2562
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:35,000
that new guy right so what can I do I
 

2563
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,549
that new guy right so what can I do I
can iterate over all V which is in the

2564
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:39,559
can iterate over all V which is in the
 

2565
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:43,150
can iterate over all V which is in the
adjacent uh set of of of U but I have to

2566
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,160
adjacent uh set of of of U but I have to
 

2567
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,109
adjacent uh set of of of U but I have to
be a little bit careful because like

2568
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
be a little bit careful because like
 

2569
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,790
be a little bit careful because like
what if I have an edge backwards so like

2570
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:46,800
what if I have an edge backwards so like
 

2571
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,710
what if I have an edge backwards so like
for instance here I have an edge back to

2572
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,720
for instance here I have an edge back to
 

2573
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,549
for instance here I have an edge back to
the

2574
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:49,559
the
 

2575
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:52,910
the
source I guess this is yeah that's a

2576
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:52,920
source I guess this is yeah that's a
 

2577
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,309
source I guess this is yeah that's a
valid example like I wouldn't want to

2578
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:55,319
valid example like I wouldn't want to
 

2579
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:57,069
valid example like I wouldn't want to
add the source to like the third level

2580
00:47:57,069 --> 00:47:57,079
add the source to like the third level
 

2581
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:59,109
add the source to like the third level
set because I already added it in a

2582
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,119
set because I already added it in a
 

2583
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,109
set because I already added it in a
previous guy right so I want to get rid

2584
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
previous guy right so I want to get rid
 

2585
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,790
previous guy right so I want to get rid
of the Union of all the previous level

2586
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:08,800

 

2587
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,589

sets of uh does that make sense so in

2588
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:12,599
sets of uh does that make sense so in
 

2589
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,549
sets of uh does that make sense so in
other words I'm only going to look at

2590
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:14,559
other words I'm only going to look at
 

2591
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,270
other words I'm only going to look at
the adjacent vertices that I haven't

2592
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
the adjacent vertices that I haven't
 

2593
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,150
the adjacent vertices that I haven't
visited yet in My Level set computation

2594
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,160
visited yet in My Level set computation
 

2595
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,190
visited yet in My Level set computation
algorithm and now all I have to do is

2596
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:22,200
algorithm and now all I have to do is
 

2597
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,630
algorithm and now all I have to do is
update my arrays right so in particular

2598
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640
update my arrays right so in particular
 

2599
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,829
update my arrays right so in particular
I'm going to add

2600
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:27,839
I'm going to add
 

2601
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,870
I'm going to add
vertex V uh to level

2602
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
vertex V uh to level
 

2603
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,790
vertex V uh to level
set I CU I haven't seen V yet I'm going

2604
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:34,800
set I CU I haven't seen V yet I'm going
 

2605
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,549
set I CU I haven't seen V yet I'm going
to set the distance from s to

2606
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
to set the distance from s to
 

2607
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,710
to set the distance from s to
v um equal to

2608
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:41,720
v um equal to
 

2609
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,230
v um equal to
I right because uh I'm I'm currently

2610
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,240
I right because uh I'm I'm currently
 

2611
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,190
I right because uh I'm I'm currently
filling in My Level set I uh and then

2612
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:48,200
filling in My Level set I uh and then
 

2613
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,270
filling in My Level set I uh and then
finally what is

2614
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:50,280
finally what is
 

2615
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,750
finally what is
p of V what is the previous vertex to V

2616
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:53,760
p of V what is the previous vertex to V
 

2617
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,470
p of V what is the previous vertex to V
in my shortest path from my source

2618
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480

 

2619
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,990

it's you right because that's the guy in

2620
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:01,000
it's you right because that's the guy in
 

2621
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,630
it's you right because that's the guy in
the previous level set that I'm building

2622
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:02,640
the previous level set that I'm building
 

2623
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,349
the previous level set that I'm building
my path from right going to say that to

2624
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:06,359
my path from right going to say that to
 

2625
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,789
my path from right going to say that to
you and then sorry I ran out of space

2626
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:08,799
you and then sorry I ran out of space
 

2627
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:12,190
you and then sorry I ran out of space
but I also have to increment

2628
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:12,200
but I also have to increment
 

2629
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,870
but I also have to increment
I okay so what does this algorithm do

2630
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:15,880
I okay so what does this algorithm do
 

2631
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,589
I okay so what does this algorithm do
it's just building one level set at a

2632
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:17,599
it's just building one level set at a
 

2633
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,950
it's just building one level set at a
time we go back to our picture right so

2634
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:19,960
time we go back to our picture right so
 

2635
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,270
time we go back to our picture right so
it starts by initializing l0 to just be

2636
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:22,280
it starts by initializing l0 to just be
 

2637
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,549
it starts by initializing l0 to just be
the source vertex then it looks at all

2638
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:24,559
the source vertex then it looks at all
 

2639
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,150
the source vertex then it looks at all
the edges coming out of that in that

2640
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
the edges coming out of that in that
 

2641
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,470
the edges coming out of that in that
case just one

2642
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:27,480
case just one
 

2643
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,270
case just one
makes that length one and so on right

2644
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:30,280
makes that length one and so on right
 

2645
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,390
makes that length one and so on right
and so this is just incrementally

2646
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:31,400
and so this is just incrementally
 

2647
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,470
and so this is just incrementally
building up all these level sets now

2648
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:33,480
building up all these level sets now
 

2649
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,710
building up all these level sets now
there's a pretty straightforward proof

2650
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,720
there's a pretty straightforward proof
 

2651
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,910
there's a pretty straightforward proof
by induction uh that this uh algorithm

2652
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:36,920
by induction uh that this uh algorithm
 

2653
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,390
by induction uh that this uh algorithm
correctly computes the L's the P's and

2654
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:39,400
correctly computes the L's the P's and
 

2655
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,950
correctly computes the L's the P's and
the Deltas which is all the information

2656
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:40,960
the Deltas which is all the information
 

2657
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,430
the Deltas which is all the information
that we need uh uh uh to compute the uh

2658
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,440
that we need uh uh uh to compute the uh
 

2659
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,030
that we need uh uh uh to compute the uh
the shortest path I think you guys can

2660
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
the shortest path I think you guys can
 

2661
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,510
the shortest path I think you guys can
do that in your recitation if you still

2662
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:46,520
do that in your recitation if you still
 

2663
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,710
do that in your recitation if you still
need a little bit of pro uh induction uh

2664
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
need a little bit of pro uh induction uh
 

2665
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,750
need a little bit of pro uh induction uh
proof uh practice here um and the final

2666
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760
proof uh practice here um and the final
 

2667
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,549
proof uh practice here um and the final
thing that we should check is what is

2668
00:49:53,549 --> 00:49:53,559
thing that we should check is what is
 

2669
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:56,030
thing that we should check is what is
the runtime of this algorithm I'm going

2670
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:56,040
the runtime of this algorithm I'm going
 

2671
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,990
the runtime of this algorithm I'm going
to squeeze in there just at the last

2672
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,000
to squeeze in there just at the last
 

2673
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,630
to squeeze in there just at the last
second here so let's take a look so

2674
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:01,640
second here so let's take a look so
 

2675
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,950
second here so let's take a look so
first of

2676
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:02,960
first of
 

2677
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,430
first of
all I did something a little oh oops

2678
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:06,440
all I did something a little oh oops
 

2679
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,470
all I did something a little oh oops
uh no that's okay um in my algorithm

2680
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:09,480
uh no that's okay um in my algorithm
 

2681
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,829
uh no that's okay um in my algorithm
actually in Step Zero I had to make an

2682
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:10,839
actually in Step Zero I had to make an
 

2683
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,510
actually in Step Zero I had to make an
array which was the size equal to the

2684
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:12,520
array which was the size equal to the
 

2685
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,630
array which was the size equal to the
number of

2686
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:13,640
number of
 

2687
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,829
number of
vertices remember that in in 66 how much

2688
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:16,839
vertices remember that in in 66 how much
 

2689
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:19,150
vertices remember that in in 66 how much
time does it take to allocate

2690
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:19,160
time does it take to allocate
 

2691
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,270
time does it take to allocate
memory yeah it takes the amount of time

2692
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:21,280
memory yeah it takes the amount of time
 

2693
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,510
memory yeah it takes the amount of time
proportional to the amount of memory

2694
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:22,520
proportional to the amount of memory
 

2695
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,390
proportional to the amount of memory
that I

2696
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:23,400
that I
 

2697
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,789
that I
allocate right so already that's I see

2698
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:25,799
allocate right so already that's I see
 

2699
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:27,190
allocate right so already that's I see
your hand but we're low on time so we're

2700
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,200
your hand but we're low on time so we're
 

2701
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,670
your hand but we're low on time so we're
going to make it to the end um already

2702
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,680
going to make it to the end um already
 

2703
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,789
going to make it to the end um already
we've incurred V time right because our

2704
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:31,799
we've incurred V time right because our
 

2705
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:34,789
we've incurred V time right because our
our shortest path array takes V space

2706
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:34,799
our shortest path array takes V space
 

2707
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:37,150
our shortest path array takes V space
but in addition to that we have this

2708
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,160
but in addition to that we have this
 

2709
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,030
but in addition to that we have this
kind of funny for Loop where for every

2710
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,040
kind of funny for Loop where for every
 

2711
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,549
kind of funny for Loop where for every
node I have to visit all of its

2712
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:43,559
node I have to visit all of its
 

2713
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:45,750
node I have to visit all of its
neighbors now first of all do I ever see

2714
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:45,760
neighbors now first of all do I ever see
 

2715
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,230
neighbors now first of all do I ever see
a node twice

2716
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,240
a node twice
 

2717
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,990
a node twice
here no right because I'm going in order

2718
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:51,000
here no right because I'm going in order
 

2719
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,349
here no right because I'm going in order
of distance and the second that I've

2720
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:53,359
of distance and the second that I've
 

2721
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,030
of distance and the second that I've
seen a node in one level set it can't be

2722
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:55,040
seen a node in one level set it can't be
 

2723
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,309
seen a node in one level set it can't be
in another right that's sort of our our

2724
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:56,319
in another right that's sort of our our
 

2725
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,870
in another right that's sort of our our
basic construction

2726
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:57,880
basic construction
 

2727
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,109
basic construction
here well conveniently for you guys we

2728
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:01,119
here well conveniently for you guys we
 

2729
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,630
here well conveniently for you guys we
already proved exactly the formula that

2730
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,640
already proved exactly the formula that
 

2731
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,270
already proved exactly the formula that
we need and if I'm lucky I didn't erase

2732
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:04,280
we need and if I'm lucky I didn't erase
 

2733
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,030
we need and if I'm lucky I didn't erase
it yeah here we

2734
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:06,040
it yeah here we
 

2735
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,430
it yeah here we
are if we take a look here this is

2736
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:08,440
are if we take a look here this is
 

2737
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,829
are if we take a look here this is
exactly the scenario that we're in right

2738
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:10,839
exactly the scenario that we're in right
 

2739
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:12,670
exactly the scenario that we're in right
because what did we do we iterated over

2740
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:12,680
because what did we do we iterated over
 

2741
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,270
because what did we do we iterated over
all the nodes in our graph and then we

2742
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
all the nodes in our graph and then we
 

2743
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,710
all the nodes in our graph and then we
iterated over all the neighbors of those

2744
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:16,720
iterated over all the neighbors of those
 

2745
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,390
iterated over all the neighbors of those
nodes and that's the basic computational

2746
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:18,400
nodes and that's the basic computational
 

2747
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,109
nodes and that's the basic computational
time in our

2748
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:20,119
time in our

for breath first search well we need to

2760
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:34,440
for breath first search well we need to
 

2761
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,630
for breath first search well we need to
construct that

00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:35,640
construct that
 

2763
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,950
construct that
array even so just in Step Zero we've

2764
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:37,960
array even so just in Step Zero we've
 

2765
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,990
array even so just in Step Zero we've
inquired V uh time and then we have to

2766
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:42,000
inquired V uh time and then we have to
 

2767
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,390
inquired V uh time and then we have to
iterate over something that takes at

iterate over something that takes at
 

2769
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,950
iterate over something that takes at
most the number of edges so overall our

00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,160
you're using to store your graph I think
 

2789
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,789
you're using to store your graph I think
that's a little fishy personally because

uh right why do we need both of these

2798
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,200
uh right why do we need both of these
 

2799
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,349
uh right why do we need both of these
terms

2800
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:18,359
terms
 

2801
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:21,470
terms
here well notice that you know if I had

2802
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:21,480
here well notice that you know if I had
 

2803
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,230
here well notice that you know if I had
no edges in My Graph right now this term

2804
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
no edges in My Graph right now this term
 

2805
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,990
no edges in My Graph right now this term
is going to dominate uh but as I add a

2806
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,000
is going to dominate uh but as I add a
 

2807
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,349
is going to dominate uh but as I add a
just to My Graph this thing could go up

2808
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:29,359
just to My Graph this thing could go up
 

2809
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,390
just to My Graph this thing could go up
to v^2 right so this is somehow a more

2810
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:31,400
to v^2 right so this is somehow a more
 

2811
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,069
to v^2 right so this is somehow a more
informative expression than just saying

2812
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:33,079
informative expression than just saying
 

2813
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:35,150
informative expression than just saying
well at worst this is v^2 time does that

2814
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:35,160
well at worst this is v^2 time does that
 

2815
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,910
well at worst this is v^2 time does that
make sense this is a slightly better

2816
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:36,920
make sense this is a slightly better
 

2817
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,230
make sense this is a slightly better
formula to have okay so with that we

2818
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:39,240
formula to have okay so with that we
 

2819
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,710
formula to have okay so with that we
just squeaked into the Finish Line we

2820
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720
just squeaked into the Finish Line we
 

2821
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,270
just squeaked into the Finish Line we
have an algorithm for computing shortest

2822
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:42,280
have an algorithm for computing shortest
 

2823
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,069
have an algorithm for computing shortest
paths uh and I'll see you guys again I

2824
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:45,079
paths uh and I'll see you guys again I
 

2825
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:48,359
paths uh and I'll see you guys again I
guess on Tuesday
