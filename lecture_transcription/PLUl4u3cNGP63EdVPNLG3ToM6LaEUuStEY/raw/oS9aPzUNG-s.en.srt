around some interesting themes um so i

48
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
around some interesting themes um so i

around some interesting themes um so i
thought i'd start with just a tiny bit

last year i got feedback that said i

00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
have serial killer handwriting i'm not
 

65
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,429
have serial killer handwriting i'm not
100 sure what that means

66
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
100 sure what that means
 

67
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,350
100 sure what that means
but we're gonna use the slides a tiny

68
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
but we're gonna use the slides a tiny
 

69
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,789
but we're gonna use the slides a tiny
bit more than normal just to make sure

70
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
bit more than normal just to make sure
 

71
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,830

you guys can read

72
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
you guys can read

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,670
you guys can read
and when i'm writing on the board at any

74
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
and when i'm writing on the board at any
 

75
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,030

point if you can't

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,789
point if you can't
tell what i wrote it's it's definitely

78
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
tell what i wrote it's it's definitely
 

79
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,109
tell what i wrote it's it's definitely
me and not you so just just let me know

00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
me and not you so just just let me know

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,710
me and not you so just just let me know
uh but in any event uh in 6006 uh

82
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
uh but in any event uh in 6006 uh
 

83

all the way back in our lecture one i

84
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
all the way back in our lecture one i
 

85
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,990
all the way back in our lecture one i
know that was a long time ago we we

86
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
know that was a long time ago we we
 

87
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,109
know that was a long time ago we we
introduced two

88
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
introduced two
 

89
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,590
introduced two
uh big keywords uh that are closely

90
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
uh big keywords uh that are closely
 

91
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,350
uh big keywords uh that are closely
related but not precisely the same

92
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
related but not precisely the same
 

93
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,350
related but not precisely the same
hopefully i've gotten this right uh but

94
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
hopefully i've gotten this right uh but
 

95
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,550
hopefully i've gotten this right uh but
but roughly uh

96
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
but roughly uh
 

97
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,670
but roughly uh
there's a theme here which is that

98
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
there's a theme here which is that
 

99
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,310
there's a theme here which is that
there's an object called an interface

100
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
there's an object called an interface
 

101
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,429
there's an object called an interface
right which is just sort of like a

102
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
right which is just sort of like a
 

103
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,950
right which is just sort of like a
program specification right it's just

104
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
program specification right it's just
 

105
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,749
program specification right it's just
telling us that

106
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
telling us that
 

107
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,429
telling us that
there's a collection of operations that

108
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
there's a collection of operations that
 

109
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,590
there's a collection of operations that
we want to implement so for example

110
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
we want to implement so for example
 

111
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,670
we want to implement so for example
a set as we're going to see today is

112
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
a set as we're going to see today is
 

113
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,429
a set as we're going to see today is
like a big pile of things

114
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
like a big pile of things
 

115
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,910
like a big pile of things

can affect the run time and and sort of

120
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
can affect the run time and and sort of
 

121
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,950
can affect the run time and and sort of
how efficient my set is

122
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
how efficient my set is
 

123
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,630
how efficient my set is
but the actual way that i interact with

124
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
but the actual way that i interact with
 

125
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,389
but the actual way that i interact with
it is the same whether i use you know an

126
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
it is the same whether i use you know an
 

127
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,069
it is the same whether i use you know an
unsorted array a sorted array or what

128
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
unsorted array a sorted array or what
 

129
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,270
unsorted array a sorted array or what
have you

130
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
have you
 

131
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,270
have you
on the other hand what happens behind

132
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
on the other hand what happens behind
 

133
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,270
on the other hand what happens behind
the scenes is something called a data

134
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
the scenes is something called a data
 

135
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,150
the scenes is something called a data
structure

136
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
structure
 

137
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,550
structure
which is a way to actually in some sense

138
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
which is a way to actually in some sense
 

139
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,229
which is a way to actually in some sense
implement an interface right so this is

140
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
implement an interface right so this is
 

141
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,030
implement an interface right so this is
an object

142
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
an object
 

143
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,949
an object
that on my computer is actually storing

144
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
that on my computer is actually storing
 

145
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,030
that on my computer is actually storing
the information and implementing

146
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
the information and implementing
 

147
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,949
the information and implementing
the set of operations that i've laid out

148
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
the set of operations that i've laid out
 

149
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,470
the set of operations that i've laid out
in my interface

150
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
in my interface
 

151
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,390
in my interface
right and so this sort of distinction i

152
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
right and so this sort of distinction i
 

153
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,229
right and so this sort of distinction i
think is is sort of a critical theme

154
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
think is is sort of a critical theme
 

155
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,910
think is is sort of a critical theme
uh in this course because for instance

156
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
uh in this course because for instance
 

157
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,589
uh in this course because for instance
in the first couple weeks

158
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
in the first couple weeks
 

159
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,710
in the first couple weeks
we're going to talk about many different

160
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
we're going to talk about many different
 

161
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,630
we're going to talk about many different
ways to implement a set i'm going to see

162
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
ways to implement a set i'm going to see
 

163
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,830
ways to implement a set i'm going to see
that there's a bunch of trade-offs right

164
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
that there's a bunch of trade-offs right
 

165
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,509
that there's a bunch of trade-offs right
some of them are really fast for certain

166
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
some of them are really fast for certain
 

167
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,270
some of them are really fast for certain
operations and slow for others

168
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
operations and slow for others
 

169
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,830
operations and slow for others
uh and and so essentially we have two

170
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
uh and and so essentially we have two
 

171
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,190
uh and and so essentially we have two
different decisions to make when we

172
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
different decisions to make when we
 

173
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,229
different decisions to make when we
choose an algorithm

174
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
choose an algorithm
 

175
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,309
choose an algorithm
one is making sure that the interface is

176
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
one is making sure that the interface is
 

177
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,430
one is making sure that the interface is
correct for the problem that we're

178
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
correct for the problem that we're
 

179
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,470
correct for the problem that we're
concerned with

180
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
concerned with
 

181
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,309
concerned with
and the other is choosing an appropriate

182
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
and the other is choosing an appropriate
 

183
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,470
and the other is choosing an appropriate
data structure whose efficiency

184
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
data structure whose efficiency
 

185
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,790
data structure whose efficiency
and memory usage and so on kind of

186
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
and memory usage and so on kind of
 

187
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,509
and memory usage and so on kind of
aligns

188
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
aligns
 

189
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,030
aligns
with the priorities that we have for the

190
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
with the priorities that we have for the
 

191
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,630
with the priorities that we have for the
application we have in mind

192
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
application we have in mind
 

193
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,910
application we have in mind
so hopefully this kind of high-level

194
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
so hopefully this kind of high-level
 

195
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,589
so hopefully this kind of high-level
theme makes sense and really kind of

196
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
theme makes sense and really kind of
 

197
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,710
theme makes sense and really kind of
spiritually i think

198
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
spiritually i think
 

199
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,470
spiritually i think
that's sort of the main message to get

200
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
that's sort of the main message to get
 

201
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,149
that's sort of the main message to get
out of this course in the first couple

202
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
out of this course in the first couple
 

203
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,949
out of this course in the first couple
weeks even if

204
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
weeks even if
 

205
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,630
weeks even if
you know these o's and thetas and and so

206
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
you know these o's and thetas and and so
 

207
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,550
you know these o's and thetas and and so
on you know are kind of easy to

208
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
on you know are kind of easy to
 

209
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,949
on you know are kind of easy to
lose the force through the trees in any

210
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
lose the force through the trees in any
 

211
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,750
lose the force through the trees in any
event

212
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
event
 

213
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,990
event
today uh in our lecture we're concerned

214
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
today uh in our lecture we're concerned
 

215
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,830
today uh in our lecture we're concerned
with one particular interface which is

216
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
with one particular interface which is
 

217
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,270
with one particular interface which is
called a set

218
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
called a set
 

219
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,630
called a set
set is exactly what it sounds like it's

220
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
set is exactly what it sounds like it's
 

221
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,390
set is exactly what it sounds like it's
a big pile of things

222
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
a big pile of things
 

223
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,750
a big pile of things
uh and and so a set interface is sort of

224
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
uh and and so a set interface is sort of
 

225
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,430
uh and and so a set interface is sort of
like an object that just you can keep

226
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
like an object that just you can keep
 

227
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,270
like an object that just you can keep
adding things to it and then querying

228
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
adding things to it and then querying
 

229
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,910
adding things to it and then querying
inside of my set is this object here can

230
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
inside of my set is this object here can
 

231
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,830
inside of my set is this object here can
i find it and then maybe i associate

232
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
i find it and then maybe i associate
 

233
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,550
i find it and then maybe i associate
with my

234
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
with my
 

235
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,390
with my
objects in my set different information

236
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
objects in my set different information
 

237
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,910
objects in my set different information
so for example

238
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
so for example
 

239
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,589
so for example
maybe i have a set which represents all

240
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
maybe i have a set which represents all
 

241
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,229
maybe i have a set which represents all
the students in our classroom today

242
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
the students in our classroom today
 

243
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,229
the students in our classroom today
yeah and all of you guys are associated

244
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
yeah and all of you guys are associated
 

245
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,229
yeah and all of you guys are associated
uh with your student id which i believe

246
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
uh with your student id which i believe
 

247
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,990
uh with your student id which i believe
at mit is a number

248
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
at mit is a number
 

249
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,830
at mit is a number
yeah which has a less than sign which is

250
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
yeah which has a less than sign which is
 

251
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,270
yeah which has a less than sign which is
convenient so we can sort all of you

252
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
convenient so we can sort all of you
 

253
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,229
convenient so we can sort all of you
guys

254
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
guys
 

255
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,509
guys
and that might be the key that's

256
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
and that might be the key that's
 

257
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,990
and that might be the key that's
associated to every object in the room

258
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
associated to every object in the room
 

259
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,589
associated to every object in the room
and so when i'm searching for students

260
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
and so when i'm searching for students
 

261
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,350
and so when i'm searching for students
maybe i enter in the student

262
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
maybe i enter in the student
 

263
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,429
maybe i enter in the student
number and then i want to ask my set

264
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
number and then i want to ask my set
 

265
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,030
number and then i want to ask my set
does this number exist in the set of

266
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
does this number exist in the set of
 

267
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,190
does this number exist in the set of
students that are in 6006

268
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
students that are in 6006
 

269
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,789
students that are in 6006
right and if it does then i can pull

270
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
right and if it does then i can pull
 

271
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,630
right and if it does then i can pull
that student back and then associated

272
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
that student back and then associated
 

273
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,070
that student back and then associated
with that object is a bunch of other

274
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
with that object is a bunch of other
 

275
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,750
with that object is a bunch of other
information that i'm not using to search

276
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
information that i'm not using to search
 

277
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,149
information that i'm not using to search
so for instance your name your your i

278
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
so for instance your name your your i
 

279
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,830
so for instance your name your your i
don't know your social security number

280
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
don't know your social security number
 

281
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,590
don't know your social security number
credit card number all the stuff that i

282
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
credit card number all the stuff that i
 

283
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,870
credit card number all the stuff that i
need to uh

284
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
need to uh
 

285
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,229
need to uh
you know have a more interesting

286
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
you know have a more interesting
 

287
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,030
you know have a more interesting
profession so uh in any event

288
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
profession so uh in any event
 

289
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,510
profession so uh in any event
um let's let's kind of fill in the

290
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
um let's let's kind of fill in the
 

291
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,270
um let's let's kind of fill in the
details of our our set interface a

292
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
details of our our set interface a
 

293
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,550
details of our our set interface a
little bit more

294
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
little bit more
 

295
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,590
little bit more
uh so our set is a container right it

296
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
uh so our set is a container right it
 

297
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,710
uh so our set is a container right it
contains

298
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
contains
 

299
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,710
contains
all of the students in this classroom in

300
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
all of the students in this classroom in
 

301
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,469
all of the students in this classroom in
some virtual sense at least

302
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
some virtual sense at least
 

303
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,830
some virtual sense at least
uh and so to build up our set of course

304
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
uh and so to build up our set of course
 

305
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,510
uh and so to build up our set of course
we need an operation that takes some

306
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
we need an operation that takes some
 

307
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,110
we need an operation that takes some
iterable object a

308
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
iterable object a
 

309
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,710
iterable object a
and builds a set out of it right so in

310
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
and builds a set out of it right so in
 

311
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,550
and builds a set out of it right so in
other words i have you know all the

312
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
other words i have you know all the
 

313
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,070
other words i have you know all the
students in this classroom represented

314
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
students in this classroom represented
 

315
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,430
students in this classroom represented
maybe in some other fashion

316
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
maybe in some other fashion
 

317
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,790
maybe in some other fashion
and i have to insert them all into my

318
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
and i have to insert them all into my
 

319
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,590
and i have to insert them all into my
set i can also ask my set for how much

320
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
set i can also ask my set for how much
 

321
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,390
set i can also ask my set for how much
stuff is in it

322
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
stuff is in it
 

323
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,230
stuff is in it
personally i would call that size but

324
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
personally i would call that size but
 

325
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,590
personally i would call that size but
length is cool too

326
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
length is cool too
 

327
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,909
length is cool too
um and then of course there are a lot of

328
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
um and then of course there are a lot of
 

329
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,350
um and then of course there are a lot of
different ways that we can interact with

330
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
different ways that we can interact with
 

331
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,230
different ways that we can interact with
our set

332
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
our set
 

333
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,790
our set
right so for instance we could say you

334
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
right so for instance we could say you
 

335
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,749
right so for instance we could say you
know

336
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
know
 

337
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,950
know
is this student taking 6006 so in set

338
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
is this student taking 6006 so in set
 

339
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,590
is this student taking 6006 so in set
language

340
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
language
 

341
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,110
language
one way to understand that is to say

342
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
one way to understand that is to say
 

343
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,270
one way to understand that is to say
that the key right the

344
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
that the key right the
 

345
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,629
that the key right the
each person in this classroom is

346
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
each person in this classroom is
 

347
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,390
each person in this classroom is
associated with the key

348
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
associated with the key
 

349
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,670
associated with the key
does that key k exist in my set in which

350
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
does that key k exist in my set in which
 

351
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,070
does that key k exist in my set in which
case i'll i'll call this find function

352
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
case i'll i'll call this find function
 

353
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,990
case i'll i'll call this find function
which uh will give me back uh the the

354
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
which uh will give me back uh the the
 

355
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,270
which uh will give me back uh the the
item with key k

356
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
item with key k
 

357
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,029
item with key k
or maybe like null or something if it

358
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
or maybe like null or something if it
 

359
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,550
or maybe like null or something if it
doesn't exist

360
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
doesn't exist
 

361
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,230
doesn't exist
uh maybe i can delete an object uh from

362
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
uh maybe i can delete an object uh from
 

363
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,150
uh maybe i can delete an object uh from
my my set or insert it notice that these

364
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
my my set or insert it notice that these
 

365
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,270
my my set or insert it notice that these
are dynamic

366
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
are dynamic
 

367
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,710
are dynamic
operations meaning that they actually

368
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
operations meaning that they actually
 

369
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,430
operations meaning that they actually
edit what's inside of my set

370
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
edit what's inside of my set
 

371
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,110
edit what's inside of my set
and then finally there are all kinds of

372
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
and then finally there are all kinds of
 

373
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,870
and then finally there are all kinds of
different sort of operations that i

374
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
different sort of operations that i
 

375
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,790
different sort of operations that i
might want to do to interact with my set

376
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
might want to do to interact with my set
 

377
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,629
might want to do to interact with my set
beyond is this thing inside of it right

378
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
beyond is this thing inside of it right
 

379
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,830
beyond is this thing inside of it right
so for instance

380
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
so for instance
 

381
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,029
so for instance
maybe okay so for for the student id

382
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
maybe okay so for for the student id
 

383
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,469
maybe okay so for for the student id
example probably finding like the

384
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
example probably finding like the
 

385
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,629
example probably finding like the
minimum id number in a class isn't

386
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
minimum id number in a class isn't
 

387
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,550
minimum id number in a class isn't
a terribly exciting exercise but maybe

388
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
a terribly exciting exercise but maybe
 

389
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,590
a terribly exciting exercise but maybe
i'm trying to find the student who's

390
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
i'm trying to find the student who's
 

391
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,350
i'm trying to find the student who's
been at mit the longest and so that

392
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
been at mit the longest and so that
 

393
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,990
been at mit the longest and so that
would be a

394
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
would be a
 

395
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,670
would be a
kind of reasonable heuristic i actually

396
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
kind of reasonable heuristic i actually
 

397
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,990
kind of reasonable heuristic i actually
have no idea whether mit student ids are

398
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
have no idea whether mit student ids are
 

399
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,230
have no idea whether mit student ids are
assigned linearly or not but in any

400
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
assigned linearly or not but in any
 

401
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,950
assigned linearly or not but in any
event uh

402
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
event uh
 

403
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,110
event uh
i could find the smallest key the

404
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
i could find the smallest key the
 

405
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,469
i could find the smallest key the
largest key and so on

406
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
largest key and so on
 

407
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,150
largest key and so on
uh in my set and these are all kind of

408
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
uh in my set and these are all kind of
 

409
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,550
uh in my set and these are all kind of
reasonable operations to query

410
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
reasonable operations to query
 

411
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,870
reasonable operations to query
uh where my object is just a thing that

412
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
uh where my object is just a thing that
 

413
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,870
uh where my object is just a thing that
stores a lot of different entities

414
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
stores a lot of different entities

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
right and the way to remember that is
 

427
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,350
right and the way to remember that is
that i haven't told you how i've

that i haven't told you how i've
 

429
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,909
that i haven't told you how i've
actually

actually
 

431
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,270
actually
implemented this right i haven't told

432
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
implemented this right i haven't told
 

433
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,029
implemented this right i haven't told
you that you know i'm gonna behind the

434
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
you that you know i'm gonna behind the
 

435
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,950
you that you know i'm gonna behind the
scenes have an array of information

436
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
scenes have an array of information
 

437
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,550
scenes have an array of information
and and look inside of it and that's how

438
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
and and look inside of it and that's how
 

439
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,390
and and look inside of it and that's how
i'm gonna implement you know find min or

440
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
i'm gonna implement you know find min or
 

441
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,390
i'm gonna implement you know find min or
find max with a for loop or whatever

all i'm telling you is that a set is a

444
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
all i'm telling you is that a set is a
 

445
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,830
all i'm telling you is that a set is a
thing that implements these operations

446
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
thing that implements these operations
 

447
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,510
thing that implements these operations
and behind the scenes my computer does

448
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
and behind the scenes my computer does
 

449
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,870
and behind the scenes my computer does
what it does

450
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
what it does
 

451
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,309
what it does
that might sound abstract but it's more

452
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
that might sound abstract but it's more
 

453
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,510
that might sound abstract but it's more
or less what you guys do when you write

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,870
you know addictive i think in python
what we're calling a set is maybe a

460
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
what we're calling a set is maybe a
 

461
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,749
what we're calling a set is maybe a
dictionary

462
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759

i'm a matlab coder i'm sorry i'm a
numerical analysis kind of guy

466
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
numerical analysis kind of guy
 

467
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,270
numerical analysis kind of guy
but um essentially you know that one of

468
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
but um essentially you know that one of
 

469
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,790
but um essentially you know that one of
the beautiful things about coding

470
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
the beautiful things about coding
 

471
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,070
the beautiful things about coding
in in these high-level programming

472
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
in in these high-level programming
 

473
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,990
in in these high-level programming
languages is that they take care

474
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
languages is that they take care
 

475
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,830
languages is that they take care
of these ugly details and what you're

476
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
of these ugly details and what you're
 

477
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,510
of these ugly details and what you're
left with is just the kind of

478
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
left with is just the kind of
 

479
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,350
left with is just the kind of
high-level uh interfacing with this

480
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
high-level uh interfacing with this
 

481
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,350
high-level uh interfacing with this
object that you need at the end of the

482
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
object that you need at the end of the
 

483
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,629
object that you need at the end of the
day

484
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
day
 

485
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,469
day
so of course in today's lecture now that

486
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
so of course in today's lecture now that
 

487
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,230
so of course in today's lecture now that
we've set out our goal

488
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
we've set out our goal
 

489
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,830
we've set out our goal
right which is to fill in like if i

490
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
right which is to fill in like if i
 

491
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,909
right which is to fill in like if i
wanted to write code for a set

492
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
wanted to write code for a set
 

493
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,990
wanted to write code for a set
how could i do it now of course our goal

494
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
how could i do it now of course our goal
 

495
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,589
how could i do it now of course our goal
is to give different data structures

496
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
is to give different data structures
 

497
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,270
is to give different data structures
that implement these and then understand

498
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
that implement these and then understand
 

499
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,469
that implement these and then understand
them in terms of their

500
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
them in terms of their
 

501
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,710
them in terms of their
efficiency data storage correctness all

502
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
efficiency data storage correctness all
 

503
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,629
efficiency data storage correctness all
that good stuff

504
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
that good stuff
 

505
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,270
that good stuff
so before we get into all these ugly

506
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
so before we get into all these ugly
 

507
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,550
so before we get into all these ugly
details let me pause for a second are

508
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
details let me pause for a second are
 

509
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,110
details let me pause for a second are
there any

510
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
there any
 

511
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,230
there any
questions about this basic interface

512
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
questions about this basic interface
 

513
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,510
questions about this basic interface
y'all should feel free to stop me

514
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
y'all should feel free to stop me
 

515
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,950
y'all should feel free to stop me
anytime because this is going to be

516
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
anytime because this is going to be
 

517
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,309
anytime because this is going to be
hella boring if you're not getting the

518
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
hella boring if you're not getting the
 

519
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,410
hella boring if you're not getting the
first slide or two

520
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:53,420

 

521
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,830

[Music]

522
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
[Music]
 

523
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,390
[Music]
yes

524
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400

 

525
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,629

so the question was uh what exactly is

526
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
so the question was uh what exactly is
 

527
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,550
so the question was uh what exactly is
this insert operation doing

528
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
this insert operation doing
 

529
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,990
this insert operation doing
so i think working in the analogy of the

530
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
so i think working in the analogy of the
 

531
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,670
so i think working in the analogy of the
students in this classroom is kind of a

532
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
students in this classroom is kind of a
 

533
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,710
students in this classroom is kind of a
reasonable one

534
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
reasonable one
 

535
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,150
reasonable one
so i'm going to build up an object which

536
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
so i'm going to build up an object which
 

537
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,230
so i'm going to build up an object which
is a student right so in this

538
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
is a student right so in this
 

539
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,749
is a student right so in this
uh lecture notes i think we've been

540
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
uh lecture notes i think we've been
 

541
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,990
uh lecture notes i think we've been
consistent i caught one or two typos we

542
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
consistent i caught one or two typos we
 

543
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,909
consistent i caught one or two typos we
think of x as the object that contains

544
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
think of x as the object that contains
 

545
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,589
think of x as the object that contains
all of the information

546
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
all of the information
 

547
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,990
all of the information
and then associated with that is one

548
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
and then associated with that is one
 

549
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,670
and then associated with that is one
piece which is called the key

550
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
piece which is called the key
 

551
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,749
piece which is called the key
that's we're going to use the letter k

552
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
that's we're going to use the letter k
 

553
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,110
that's we're going to use the letter k
right and that's like your student id

554
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
right and that's like your student id
 

555
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,150
right and that's like your student id
that's the thing i'm going to use to

556
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
that's the thing i'm going to use to
 

557
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,950
that's the thing i'm going to use to
search

558
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
search
 

559
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,269
search
right so what the insert operation does

560
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
right so what the insert operation does
 

561
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,190
right so what the insert operation does
is it takes this whole student object

562
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
is it takes this whole student object
 

563
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,790
is it takes this whole student object
x which includes your id your name your

564
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
x which includes your id your name your
 

565
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,389
x which includes your id your name your
phone number all that good stuff

566
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
phone number all that good stuff
 

567
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,550
phone number all that good stuff
and it starts it into the set with the

568
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
and it starts it into the set with the
 

569
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,230
and it starts it into the set with the
understanding that when i search my set

570
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
understanding that when i search my set
 

571
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,750
understanding that when i search my set
i'm going to be searching by key

572
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
i'm going to be searching by key
 

573
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,269
i'm going to be searching by key
right so when i want to find a student i

574
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
right so when i want to find a student i
 

575
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,269
right so when i want to find a student i
have to put in my id number

576
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
have to put in my id number
 

577
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,470
have to put in my id number
does that make sense cool any other

578
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
does that make sense cool any other
 

579
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,269
does that make sense cool any other
questions it's great

580
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
questions it's great
 

581
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,470
questions it's great
fabulous okay so now uh let's let's talk

582
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
fabulous okay so now uh let's let's talk
 

583
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,829
fabulous okay so now uh let's let's talk
about how to actually implement this

584
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
about how to actually implement this
 

585
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,190
about how to actually implement this
thing and thankfully

586
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
thing and thankfully
 

587
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,269
thing and thankfully
we're already equipped with uh at least

588
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
we're already equipped with uh at least
 

589
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,470
we're already equipped with uh at least
a very simple way that we could

590
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
a very simple way that we could
 

591
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,670
a very simple way that we could
implement a set

592
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
implement a set
 

593
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,430
implement a set
uh based on what you've already seen in

594
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
uh based on what you've already seen in
 

595
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,790
uh based on what you've already seen in
your previous programming classes or

596
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
your previous programming classes or
 

597
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,269
your previous programming classes or
even in just in the last two lectures

598
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
even in just in the last two lectures
 

599
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,190
even in just in the last two lectures
which is one way to understand a set or

600
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
which is one way to understand a set or
 

601
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,790
which is one way to understand a set or
to implement it rather

602
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
to implement it rather
 

603
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,949
to implement it rather
would be to just store a giant array

604
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959

 

605
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,949

of objects that are in my set

606
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959

 

607
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,870

i suppose uh continuing with the sort of

608
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
i suppose uh continuing with the sort of
 

609
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,150
i suppose uh continuing with the sort of
theme of the last two lectures

610
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
theme of the last two lectures
 

611
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,150
theme of the last two lectures
this is not a space in memory but rather

612
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
this is not a space in memory but rather
 

613
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,350
this is not a space in memory but rather
a

614
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
a
 

615
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,430
a
metaphorical array you know a

616
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
metaphorical array you know a
 

617
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,110
metaphorical array you know a
theoretical but it doesn't really matter

618
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
theoretical but it doesn't really matter
 

619
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,590
theoretical but it doesn't really matter
and

620
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
and
 

621
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,030
and
so one way to store my set

622
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
so one way to store my set
 

623
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,910
so one way to store my set
would be to just store a bunch of x's in

624
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
would be to just store a bunch of x's in
 

625
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,670
would be to just store a bunch of x's in
no particular order

626
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
no particular order
 

627
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,190
no particular order
does that make sense so i have a big

628
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
does that make sense so i have a big
 

629
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,590
does that make sense so i have a big
piece of memory every piece of memory uh

630
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
piece of memory every piece of memory uh
 

631
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,430
piece of memory every piece of memory uh
is associated with a different object in

632
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
is associated with a different object in
 

633
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,910
is associated with a different object in
my set

634
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
my set
 

635
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,590
my set
obviously this is quite easy to build

636
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
obviously this is quite easy to build
 

637
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,269
obviously this is quite easy to build
right i just make a big ray and dump

638
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
right i just make a big ray and dump
 

639
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,949
right i just make a big ray and dump
everything in there

640
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
everything in there
 

641
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,030
everything in there
and the question is is this particularly

642
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
and the question is is this particularly
 

643
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,949
and the question is is this particularly
efficient or useful way

644
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
efficient or useful way
 

645
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,070
efficient or useful way
to implement a set right so for instance

646
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
to implement a set right so for instance
 

647
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,509
to implement a set right so for instance
let's say that i have

648
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
let's say that i have
 

649
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,350
let's say that i have
you know i i have a set of all the

650
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
you know i i have a set of all the
 

651
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,030
you know i i have a set of all the
students in this classroom

652
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
students in this classroom
 

653
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,389
students in this classroom
there's like some ridiculous number of

654
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
there's like some ridiculous number of
 

655
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,470
there's like some ridiculous number of
you guys so actually you know asymptotic

656
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
you guys so actually you know asymptotic
 

657
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,670
you guys so actually you know asymptotic
efficiency maybe actually

658
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
efficiency maybe actually
 

659
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,550
efficiency maybe actually
matters a little bit and i want to query

660
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
matters a little bit and i want to query
 

661
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,910
matters a little bit and i want to query
does this student

662
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
does this student

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,030
domain taking 606
the answer is no i think teaching taking

668
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
the answer is no i think teaching taking
 

669
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,150
the answer is no i think teaching taking
i don't know

670
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
i don't know
 

671
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,030
i don't know
uh but in any event how do i implement

672
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
uh but in any event how do i implement
 

673
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,150
uh but in any event how do i implement
it if my set is unordered

674
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
it if my set is unordered
 

675
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:35,350
it if my set is unordered
we'll think about it for a second yeah

676
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360

 

677
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,269

it's actually an interesting uh

678
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
it's actually an interesting uh
 

679
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,710
it's actually an interesting uh
suggestion which is going to anticipate

680
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
suggestion which is going to anticipate
 

681
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,990
suggestion which is going to anticipate
what's happening later in this lecture

682
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
what's happening later in this lecture
 

683
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,670
what's happening later in this lecture
which was to sort the set

684
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
which was to sort the set
 

685
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,910
which was to sort the set
and then binary search right but let's

686
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
and then binary search right but let's
 

687
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,190
and then binary search right but let's
say that actually i only have to do this

688
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
say that actually i only have to do this
 

689
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,550
say that actually i only have to do this
once for some reason i build up a whole

690
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
once for some reason i build up a whole
 

691
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,470
once for some reason i build up a whole
set of the people in this classroom

692
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
set of the people in this classroom
 

693
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,829
set of the people in this classroom
and i just want to know is eric domain

694
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
and i just want to know is eric domain
 

695
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,509
and i just want to know is eric domain
in this class right so then that

696
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
in this class right so then that
 

697
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,350
in this class right so then that
algorithm would take n log n time

698
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
algorithm would take n log n time
 

699
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,509
algorithm would take n log n time
right because i've got to sort everybody

700
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
right because i've got to sort everybody
 

701
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,269
right because i've got to sort everybody
and then i have to do binary search

702
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
and then i have to do binary search
 

703
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:57,910
and then i have to do binary search
which is maybe

704
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
which is maybe
 

705
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,470
which is maybe
login time but i claim that if the only

706
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
login time but i claim that if the only
 

707
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,750
login time but i claim that if the only
thing i care about is building up my

708
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
thing i care about is building up my
 

709
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,389
thing i care about is building up my
entire set

710
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
entire set
 

711
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,910
entire set
and searching it once there's actually a

712
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
and searching it once there's actually a
 

713
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,430
and searching it once there's actually a
faster algorithm this is going to be

714
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
faster algorithm this is going to be
 

715
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,870
faster algorithm this is going to be
needlessly confusing because we're going

716
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
needlessly confusing because we're going
 

717
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,069
needlessly confusing because we're going
to see that this is really

718
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
to see that this is really
 

719
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,350
to see that this is really
not the right way to implement it in

720
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
not the right way to implement it in
 

721
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,430
not the right way to implement it in
about 38 seconds

722
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
about 38 seconds
 

723
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,870
about 38 seconds
yes yeah just iterate from beginning to

724
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
yes yeah just iterate from beginning to
 

725
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,509
yes yeah just iterate from beginning to
this array

726
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
this array
 

727
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,990
this array
and say is this guy eric no is this guy

728
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
and say is this guy eric no is this guy
 

729
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,590
and say is this guy eric no is this guy
eric no is this guy eric

730
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
eric no is this guy eric
 

731
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,870
eric no is this guy eric
yes and then return him right so in the

732
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
yes and then return him right so in the
 

733
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,990
yes and then return him right so in the
worst case

734
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
worst case
 

735
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,230
worst case
how long will that algorithm take well

736
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
how long will that algorithm take well
 

737
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,949
how long will that algorithm take well
in the worst case i have really bad luck

738
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
in the worst case i have really bad luck
 

739
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,630
in the worst case i have really bad luck
and your instructor is all the way at

740
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
and your instructor is all the way at
 

741
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,470
and your instructor is all the way at
the end of the list

742
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
the end of the list
 

743
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,790
the end of the list
right so in this case what is that going

744
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
right so in this case what is that going
 

745
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,150
right so in this case what is that going
to mean that means that i have to walk

746
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
to mean that means that i have to walk
 

747
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,069
to mean that means that i have to walk
along the entire array

748
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
along the entire array
 

749
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,230
along the entire array
before i find him so that algorithm

750
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
before i find him so that algorithm
 

751
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,829
before i find him so that algorithm
takes order and time

752
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
takes order and time
 

753
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,430
takes order and time
and so your colleague's intuition that

754
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
and so your colleague's intuition that
 

755
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,350
and so your colleague's intuition that
somehow this is quite inefficient

756
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
somehow this is quite inefficient
 

757
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,190
somehow this is quite inefficient
is absolutely correct right if i know

758
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
is absolutely correct right if i know
 

759
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,310
is absolutely correct right if i know
that i'm going to have to search my

760
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
that i'm going to have to search my
 

761
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,750
that i'm going to have to search my
array many many times for different

762
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
array many many times for different
 

763
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,629
array many many times for different
people

764
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
people
 

765
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,990
people
then probably it makes sense to do a

766
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
then probably it makes sense to do a
 

767
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,190
then probably it makes sense to do a
little bit of work ahead of time like

768
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
little bit of work ahead of time like
 

769
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,870
little bit of work ahead of time like
sorting the list

770
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
sorting the list
 

771
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,710
sorting the list
and then my my query is much more

772
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
and then my my query is much more
 

773
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,230
and then my my query is much more
efficient

774
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
efficient
 

775
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,670
efficient
but this is all just to say that an

776
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
but this is all just to say that an
 

777
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,190
but this is all just to say that an
unordered array is a perfectly

778
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
unordered array is a perfectly
 

779
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,030
unordered array is a perfectly
reasonable way to implement the set

780
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
reasonable way to implement the set
 

781
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,150
reasonable way to implement the set
interface

782
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
interface
 

783
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,670
interface
and then searching that array will take

784
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
and then searching that array will take
 

785
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,629
and then searching that array will take
linear time every single time i search

786
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
linear time every single time i search
 

787
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,870
linear time every single time i search
yup and of course if you go down your

788
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
yup and of course if you go down your
 

789
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,629
yup and of course if you go down your
list of all of the different operations

790

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
you might want to do
 

793
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,670
you might want to do
on a set you'll see that they all take

794
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
on a set you'll see that they all take
 

795
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,670
on a set you'll see that they all take
linear time so for instance how do i

796
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
linear time so for instance how do i
 

797
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,470
linear time so for instance how do i
build my set

798

students isn't sorted

834
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
students isn't sorted
 

835
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,030
students isn't sorted
is to what just iterate over every

836
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
is to what just iterate over every
 

837
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,310
is to what just iterate over every
single student in the class

838
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
single student in the class
 

839
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,829
single student in the class
and if the guy that i'm looking at has a

840
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
and if the guy that i'm looking at has a
 

841
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,910
and if the guy that i'm looking at has a
smaller id than the one that i found

842
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
smaller id than the one that i found
 

843
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,710
smaller id than the one that i found
replace it does that make sense to

844
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
replace it does that make sense to
 

845
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,069
replace it does that make sense to
everybody so basically everything you

846
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
everybody so basically everything you
 

847
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,190
everybody so basically everything you
can do in a set

848
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
can do in a set
 

849
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,710
can do in a set
you can implement and i think all of you

850
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
you can implement and i think all of you
 

851
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,990
you can implement and i think all of you
guys are more than qualified to

852
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
guys are more than qualified to
 

853
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,710
guys are more than qualified to

as an unordered array it's just going to

856
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
as an unordered array it's just going to
 

857
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,350
as an unordered array it's just going to
be slow yes

858
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360

 

859
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,190

yeah that's right so i actually i don't

860
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
yeah that's right so i actually i don't
 

861
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,550
yeah that's right so i actually i don't
know in this class

862
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
know in this class
 

863
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,949
know in this class
if if you're i guess the set interface

864
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
if if you're i guess the set interface
 

865
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,150
if if you're i guess the set interface
the way that we've described it here is

866
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
the way that we've described it here is
 

867
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,910
the way that we've described it here is
dynamic we can just keep adding stuff to

868
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
dynamic we can just keep adding stuff to
 

869
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,550
dynamic we can just keep adding stuff to
it

870
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
it
 

871
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,470
it
uh in that case remember this amortized

872
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
uh in that case remember this amortized
 

873
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,310
uh in that case remember this amortized

874
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
even better sorry
 

883
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,150
even better sorry
uh even if it weren't dynamic um if

884
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
uh even if it weren't dynamic um if
 

885
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,710
uh even if it weren't dynamic um if
i wanted to replace an existing key like

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
for some reason two students have

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,910
for some reason two students have
the same id this is a terrible analogy

890
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
the same id this is a terrible analogy
 

891
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,990
the same id this is a terrible analogy
i'm sorry uh but but in any event if i

892
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
i'm sorry uh but but in any event if i
 

893
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,870
i'm sorry uh but but in any event if i
wanted to replace

894
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
wanted to replace
 

895
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,910
wanted to replace
uh an object with a new one well what i

896
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
uh an object with a new one well what i
 

897
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,110
uh an object with a new one well what i
have to do i'd have to search for that

898
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
have to do i'd have to search for that
 

899
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,030
have to do i'd have to search for that
object first and then replace it

900
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
object first and then replace it
 

901
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,550
object first and then replace it
and that search is gonna take order and

902
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
and that search is gonna take order and
 

903
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,230
and that search is gonna take order and
time from our argument before

904
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
time from our argument before
 

905
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,069
time from our argument before
thank you okay so uh right

906
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
thank you okay so uh right
 

907
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,670
thank you okay so uh right
in some sense we're done right we've now

908
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
in some sense we're done right we've now
 

909
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,710
in some sense we're done right we've now
implemented this interface life is good

910
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
implemented this interface life is good
 

911
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,150
implemented this interface life is good
and and of course this is the difference

912
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
and and of course this is the difference
 

913
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,069
and and of course this is the difference
between you know existence and and

914
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
between you know existence and and
 

915
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,110
between you know existence and and
actually uh

916
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
actually uh
 

917
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,629
actually uh
caring about the details inside of this

918
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
caring about the details inside of this
 

919
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,150
caring about the details inside of this
thing right we've shown that one can

920
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
thing right we've shown that one can
 

921
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,750
thing right we've shown that one can
implement a set

922
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
implement a set
 

923
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,110
implement a set
but it's not a terribly efficient way to

924
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
but it's not a terribly efficient way to
 

925
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,870
but it's not a terribly efficient way to
do it by just storing a big like hot

926
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
do it by just storing a big like hot
 

927
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,350
do it by just storing a big like hot

order yeah

932
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
order yeah
 

933
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,509
order yeah
so instead of that uh conveniently our

934
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
so instead of that uh conveniently our
 

935
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,790
so instead of that uh conveniently our
colleague in the front row here has

936
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
colleague in the front row here has
 

937
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,470
colleague in the front row here has
already suggested a different data

938
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
already suggested a different data
 

939
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,430
already suggested a different data

940
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
structure
 

941
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,230
structure
which is to store our set not as just a

942
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
which is to store our set not as just a
 

943
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,310
which is to store our set not as just a
disorganized array in any

disorganized array in any
 

945
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,110
disorganized array in any
arbitrary order but rather to keep the

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
arbitrary order but rather to keep the
 

947
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,150

organized by key right so in other words

950
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
organized by key right so in other words
 

951
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,030
organized by key right so in other words
like if i have this array of all of the

952
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
like if i have this array of all of the
 

953
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,389
like if i have this array of all of the
students in our classroom

954
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
students in our classroom
 

955
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,069
students in our classroom
and the very first element in my array

956
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
and the very first element in my array
 

957
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,110
and the very first element in my array
is going to be the student with the

958
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
is going to be the student with the
 

959
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,470
is going to be the student with the
smallest id number

960
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
smallest id number
 

961
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,069
smallest id number
the second is the second smallest id

962
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
the second is the second smallest id
 

963
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,670
the second is the second smallest id
number all the way to the end of the

964
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
number all the way to the end of the
 

965
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,710
number all the way to the end of the
array which is a student with the

966
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
array which is a student with the
 

967
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,949
array which is a student with the
biggest id number

968
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
biggest id number
 

969
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,350
biggest id number
now does that mean i want to like do

970
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
now does that mean i want to like do
 

971
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,949
now does that mean i want to like do
arithmetic on student id numbers

972
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
arithmetic on student id numbers
 

973
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,910
arithmetic on student id numbers
absolutely not

974
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
absolutely not
 

975
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,829
absolutely not
but it's just a way to sort of impose

976
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
but it's just a way to sort of impose
 

977
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,430
but it's just a way to sort of impose
order on that list so that i can search

978
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
order on that list so that i can search
 

979
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,829
order on that list so that i can search
it very quickly later

980
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
it very quickly later
 

981
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,230
it very quickly later
okay so if i want to fill in the set

982
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
okay so if i want to fill in the set
 

983
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,590
okay so if i want to fill in the set
interface

984
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
interface
 

985
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,230
interface
and i have somehow a sorted array of

986
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
and i have somehow a sorted array of
 

987
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,350
and i have somehow a sorted array of
students

988
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
students
 

989
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,189
students
right so again they're organized by

990
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
right so again they're organized by
 

991
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,870
right so again they're organized by
student id number

992
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
student id number
 

993
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,550
student id number
then my runtime starts to get a little

994
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
then my runtime starts to get a little
 

995
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,470
then my runtime starts to get a little
more interesting

996
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
more interesting
 

997
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,110
more interesting
yeah so now uh insertion deletion still

998
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
yeah so now uh insertion deletion still
 

999
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,550
yeah so now uh insertion deletion still
takes the same amount of time but let's

1000
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
takes the same amount of time but let's
 

1001
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,990
takes the same amount of time but let's
say that i want to find the student with

1002
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
say that i want to find the student with
 

1003
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,910
say that i want to find the student with
the minimum id number right this find

1004
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
the minimum id number right this find
 

1005
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,389
the minimum id number right this find
min

1006
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
min
 

1007
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,110
min
function well how could i do it in a

1008
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
function well how could i do it in a
 

1009
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,790
function well how could i do it in a
sorted array

1010
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
sorted array
 

1011
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,310
sorted array
keyword is sorted here where's the main

1012
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
keyword is sorted here where's the main
 

1013
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,230
keyword is sorted here where's the main
element of an array yes

1014
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240

 

1015
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,230

uh yeah in fact i can give a moderately

1016
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
uh yeah in fact i can give a moderately
 

1017
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,749
uh yeah in fact i can give a moderately
faster algorithm which is just look at

1018
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
faster algorithm which is just look at
 

1019
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,629
faster algorithm which is just look at
the first one

1020
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
the first one
 

1021
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,949
the first one
right if i want the minimum element of

1022
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
right if i want the minimum element of
 

1023
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,990
right if i want the minimum element of
an array it

1024
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
an array it
 

1025
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,590
an array it
and the array is in sorted order i know

1026
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
and the array is in sorted order i know
 

1027
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,350
and the array is in sorted order i know
that's the first thing

1028
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
that's the first thing
 

1029
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,189
that's the first thing
right so that's order one time to answer

1030
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
right so that's order one time to answer
 

1031
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,870
right so that's order one time to answer
that kind of a question and similarly if

1032
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
that kind of a question and similarly if
 

1033
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,710
that kind of a question and similarly if
i want the the thing with the biggest id

1034
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
i want the the thing with the biggest id
 

1035
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,269
i want the the thing with the biggest id
number

1036
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
number
 

1037
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,310
number
i look all the way at the end now uh in

1038
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
i look all the way at the end now uh in
 

1039
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,189
i look all the way at the end now uh in
six double o

1040
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
six double o
 

1041
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,590
six double o
what triple o this mit student class

1042
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
what triple o this mit student class
 

1043
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,230
what triple o this mit student class
numbers are

1044
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
numbers are
 

1045
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,350
numbers are
super confusing to me uh this in 6 001

1046
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
super confusing to me uh this in 6 001
 

1047
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,590
super confusing to me uh this in 6 001
604 2 you guys already i think learned

1048
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
604 2 you guys already i think learned
 

1049
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,389
604 2 you guys already i think learned
about binary search and

1050
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
about binary search and
 

1051
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,629
about binary search and
even may have implemented it so what do

1052
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
even may have implemented it so what do
 

1053
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,550
even may have implemented it so what do
we know if my array is sorted

1054
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
we know if my array is sorted
 

1055
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,150
we know if my array is sorted
how long does it take for me to search

1056
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
how long does it take for me to search
 

1057
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,870
how long does it take for me to search
for any given element

1058
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
for any given element
 

1059
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,430
for any given element
yes login time that's absolutely right

1060
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
yes login time that's absolutely right
 

1061
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,590
yes login time that's absolutely right
right because i can cut my array in half

1062
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
right because i can cut my array in half
 

1063
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,350
right because i can cut my array in half
you know if my key is bigger or smaller

1064
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
you know if my key is bigger or smaller
 

1065
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,829
you know if my key is bigger or smaller
then i look on the left or the right

1066
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
then i look on the left or the right
 

1067
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,870
then i look on the left or the right
and and so this is a much more efficient

1068
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
and and so this is a much more efficient
 

1069
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,389
and and so this is a much more efficient
uh means of searching a set yeah

1070
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
uh means of searching a set yeah
 

1071
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,509
uh means of searching a set yeah
uh so in particular you know 6006 this

1072
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
uh so in particular you know 6006 this
 

1073
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,350
uh so in particular you know 6006 this
year has 400 students maybe next year it

1074
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
year has 400 students maybe next year it
 

1075
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,949
year has 400 students maybe next year it
has 4 000. you know eventually it's

1076
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
has 4 000. you know eventually it's
 

1077
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,550
has 4 000. you know eventually it's
going to have like billions

1078
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
going to have like billions
 

1079
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,550
going to have like billions
right uh then then what's going to

1080
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
right uh then then what's going to
 

1081
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,269
right uh then then what's going to
happen well if i use my unordered array

1082
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
happen well if i use my unordered array
 

1083
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,629
happen well if i use my unordered array
you know and i have a billion students

1084
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
you know and i have a billion students
 

1085
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,870
you know and i have a billion students
in this class it's going to happen

1086
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
in this class it's going to happen
 

1087
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,629
in this class it's going to happen
well then it's going to take me roughly

1088
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
well then it's going to take me roughly
 

1089
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,550
well then it's going to take me roughly
a billion computations to find any one

1090
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
a billion computations to find any one
 

1091
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,470
a billion computations to find any one
student in this course

1092
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
student in this course
 

1093
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,230
student in this course
whereas log of a billion is a heck of a

1094
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
whereas log of a billion is a heck of a
 

1095
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,590
whereas log of a billion is a heck of a
lot faster

1096
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
lot faster
 

1097
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,549
lot faster
right on the other hand i've kind of

1098
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
right on the other hand i've kind of
 

1099
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,110
right on the other hand i've kind of
swept a detail under the rug here

1100
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
swept a detail under the rug here
 

1101
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,189
swept a detail under the rug here
which is how do i actually get a sorted

1102
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
which is how do i actually get a sorted
 

1103
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,549
which is how do i actually get a sorted
array to begin with

1104
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
array to begin with
 

1105
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,590
array to begin with
and what we're going to see in today's

1106
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
and what we're going to see in today's
 

1107
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,510
and what we're going to see in today's
lecture is that that takes more time

1108
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
lecture is that that takes more time
 

1109
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,789
lecture is that that takes more time
than building it if i just have a

1110
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
than building it if i just have a
 

1111
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,230
than building it if i just have a
disorganized list right building a

1112
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
disorganized list right building a
 

1113
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,590
disorganized list right building a
disorganized list is the easy thing to

1114
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
disorganized list is the easy thing to
 

1115
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,029
disorganized list is the easy thing to
do you probably all do it at home when

1116
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
do you probably all do it at home when
 

1117
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,909
do you probably all do it at home when
you're cleaning house yeah but actually

1118
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
you're cleaning house yeah but actually
 

1119
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,510
you're cleaning house yeah but actually
sorting a list of numbers requires a

1120
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
sorting a list of numbers requires a
 

1121
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,110
sorting a list of numbers requires a
little bit more work

1122
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
little bit more work
 

1123
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,630
little bit more work
and so this is a great example where

1124
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
and so this is a great example where
 

1125
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,070
and so this is a great example where
there's at least a tiny amount of

1126
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
there's at least a tiny amount of
 

1127
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,190
there's at least a tiny amount of
trade-off right

1128
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
trade-off right
 

1129
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,430
trade-off right
where now building my sorted array to

1130
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
where now building my sorted array to
 

1131
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,870
where now building my sorted array to
represent my set is going to take a

1132
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
represent my set is going to take a
 

1133
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,990
represent my set is going to take a
little more computation we're going to

1134
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
little more computation we're going to
 

1135
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,750
little more computation we're going to
see it's n log n time

1136
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
see it's n log n time
 

1137
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,510
see it's n log n time
but then once i've done that sort of at

1138
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
but then once i've done that sort of at
 

1139
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,350
but then once i've done that sort of at
step zero now

1140
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
step zero now
 

1141
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,950
step zero now
a lot of these other operations that i

1142
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
a lot of these other operations that i
 

1143
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,390
a lot of these other operations that i
typically care about at a set like

1144
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
typically care about at a set like
 

1145
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,909
typically care about at a set like
searching it for a given key

1146
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
searching it for a given key
 

1147
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,390
searching it for a given key
are going to go a lot faster using you

1148
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
are going to go a lot faster using you
 

1149
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,549
are going to go a lot faster using you
know binary search

1150
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
know binary search
 

1151
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,430
know binary search
okay so so this is our basic uh uh sort

1152
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
okay so so this is our basic uh uh sort
 

1153
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,710
okay so so this is our basic uh uh sort
of motivator here

1154
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
of motivator here
 

1155
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,549
of motivator here
and and so now we've seen the set

1156
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
and and so now we've seen the set
 

1157
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,070
and and so now we've seen the set
interface and two potential data

1158
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
interface and two potential data
 

1159
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,870
interface and two potential data
structures

1160
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880

and our goal for the day is going to be

1162
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
and our goal for the day is going to be
 

1163
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,789
and our goal for the day is going to be
to kind of fill in the details of that

1164
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
to kind of fill in the details of that
 

1165
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,909
to kind of fill in the details of that
second one

1166
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
second one
 

1167
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,669
second one
and since you all have already seen

1168
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
and since you all have already seen
 

1169
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,950
and since you all have already seen
binary search you've probably also

1170
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
binary search you've probably also
 

1171
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,310
binary search you've probably also
already seen sorting

1172
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
already seen sorting
 

1173
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,470
already seen sorting
but in any event uh today we're going to

1174
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
but in any event uh today we're going to
 

1175
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,190
but in any event uh today we're going to
focus mostly on the sort of lower left

1176
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
focus mostly on the sort of lower left
 

1177
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,750
focus mostly on the sort of lower left
square here right on just how can i take

1178
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
square here right on just how can i take
 

1179
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,909
square here right on just how can i take
a disorganized list of objects

1180
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
a disorganized list of objects
 

1181
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,430
a disorganized list of objects
and put it into sorted order so that i

1182
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
and put it into sorted order so that i
 

1183
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,029
and put it into sorted order so that i
can search for it later

1184
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
can search for it later
 

1185
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,590
can search for it later
right so in other words our big problem

1186
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
right so in other words our big problem
 

1187
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,750
right so in other words our big problem
for a lecture today

1188
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760

1189
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,669
for a lecture today
is the second thing here right just

1190
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
is the second thing here right just
 

1191
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,950
is the second thing here right just
sorting

1192
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960

incidentally in the next couple lectures

1194
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
incidentally in the next couple lectures
 

1195
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,070
incidentally in the next couple lectures
we're going to see other data sets or

1196
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
we're going to see other data sets or
 

1197
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,630
we're going to see other data sets or

1198
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
data
 

1199
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,710
data
structures rather so data structs that

1200
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720

was i used to teach machine learning

1202
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
was i used to teach machine learning
 

1203
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,630

1204
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640

1205
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,669

uh and we'll see that they have

1206
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
uh and we'll see that they have
 

1207
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,549
uh and we'll see that they have
different

1208
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
different
 

1209
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,150
different
sort of efficiency operations that we

1210
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
sort of efficiency operations that we
 

1211
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,590
sort of efficiency operations that we
can fill in this table so we're not done

1212
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
can fill in this table so we're not done
 

1213
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,630
can fill in this table so we're not done
yet but this is one step forward

1214
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
yet but this is one step forward
 

1215
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,190
yet but this is one step forward
okay so hopefully i have sort of ad

1216
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
okay so hopefully i have sort of ad
 

1217
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,110
okay so hopefully i have sort of ad
nauseam justified why one might want to

1218
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
nauseam justified why one might want to
 

1219
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,549
nauseam justified why one might want to
sort things

1220
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
sort things
 

1221
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,990
sort things
and indeed there are a couple vocabulary

1222
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
and indeed there are a couple vocabulary
 

1223
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,230
and indeed there are a couple vocabulary
words that are worth noting uh so one

1224
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
words that are worth noting uh so one
 

1225
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,230
words that are worth noting uh so one
uh so you remember that your sorting

1226
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
uh so you remember that your sorting
 

1227
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,990
uh so you remember that your sorting
algorithm is is pretty straightforward

1228
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
algorithm is is pretty straightforward
 

1229
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,830
algorithm is is pretty straightforward
in terms of how you specify it right

1230
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
in terms of how you specify it right
 

1231
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,630
in terms of how you specify it right
so in sorting your input

1232
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640

 

1233
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,390

is an array of

1234
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,400
is an array of
 

1235
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,470
is an array of
n numbers i suppose actually really

1236
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
n numbers i suppose actually really
 

1237
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:16,870
n numbers i suppose actually really
these

1238
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
these
 

1239
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,070
these
we should think of them like keys it's

1240
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
we should think of them like keys it's
 

1241
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,710
we should think of them like keys it's
not going to matter a whole lot

1242
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
not going to matter a whole lot
 

1243
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,549
not going to matter a whole lot
right and our output

1244
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
right and our output
 

1245
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,909
right and our output
i'm always very concerned that if i

1246
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
i'm always very concerned that if i
 

1247
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,350
i'm always very concerned that if i
write on the board on the back i can

1248
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
write on the board on the back i can
 

1249
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,909
write on the board on the back i can
like i

1250
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
like i
 

1251
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,270
like i
have to cover it up um it's going to be

1252
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
have to cover it up um it's going to be
 

1253
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,710
have to cover it up um it's going to be
uh

1254
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720

 

1255
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,750

out it's going to be a sorted

1256
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
out it's going to be a sorted
 

1257
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,430
out it's going to be a sorted
um array right and we'll call this guy b

1258
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
um array right and we'll call this guy b
 

1259
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,350
um array right and we'll call this guy b
and we'll call this one uh hey

1260
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
and we'll call this one uh hey
 

1261
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,710
and we'll call this one uh hey
this classroom is not optimized for

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,390
this classroom is not optimized for
short people

short people
 

1265
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,789
short people
okay uh so there's a lot of variations

1266
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
okay uh so there's a lot of variations
 

1267
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,630
okay uh so there's a lot of variations
on the basic sort of sorting problem and

1268
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
on the basic sort of sorting problem and
 

1269
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,909
on the basic sort of sorting problem and
the different algorithms that are out

1270
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
the different algorithms that are out
 

1271
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:56,390
the different algorithms that are out
there

1272
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
there
 

1273
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,830
there
uh two vocabulary words i'm gonna

1274
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
uh two vocabulary words i'm gonna
 

1275
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,590
uh two vocabulary words i'm gonna
highlight really quick one is if your

1276
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
highlight really quick one is if your
 

1277
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,950
highlight really quick one is if your
sort is destructive

1278
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
sort is destructive
 

1279
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,110
sort is destructive
what that means is the rather than like

1280
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
what that means is the rather than like
 

1281
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,350
what that means is the rather than like
reserving some new memory for my sorted

1282
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
reserving some new memory for my sorted
 

1283
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,630
reserving some new memory for my sorted
array b

1284
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
array b
 

1285
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,870
array b
and then putting a sorted version of a

1286
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
and then putting a sorted version of a
 

1287
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,070
and then putting a sorted version of a
into b

1288
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
into b
 

1289
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,230
into b
a destructive algorithm is one that just

1290
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
a destructive algorithm is one that just
 

1291
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,950
a destructive algorithm is one that just
overwrites a with a sorted version of a

1292
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
overwrites a with a sorted version of a
 

1293
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,950
overwrites a with a sorted version of a
right so a lot of like certainly the c

1294
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
right so a lot of like certainly the c
 

1295
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,149
right so a lot of like certainly the c
plus interface

like you could imagine a sorting

1316
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
like you could imagine a sorting
 

1317
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,070
like you could imagine a sorting
algorithm that like

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,310
right like for instance the world's
dumbest uh

1328
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
dumbest uh
 

1329
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,990
dumbest uh
destructive sort might be to call your

1330
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
destructive sort might be to call your
 

1331
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,590
destructive sort might be to call your
non-destructive sort and then copy it

1332
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
non-destructive sort and then copy it
 

1333
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:49,909
non-destructive sort and then copy it
back

1334
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
back
 

1335
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,710
back
into the into a right but that would

1336
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
into the into a right but that would
 

1337
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,230
into the into a right but that would
require order n space

1338
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
require order n space
 

1339
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,630
require order n space
to do so if my algorithm additionally

1340
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
to do so if my algorithm additionally
 

1341
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,149
to do so if my algorithm additionally
has the property that it doesn't reserve

1342
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
has the property that it doesn't reserve
 

1343
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,430
has the property that it doesn't reserve
any extra space

1344
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
any extra space
 

1345
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,669
any extra space
at least up to a constant uh then we

1346
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
at least up to a constant uh then we
 

1347
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,750
at least up to a constant uh then we
call that in place

1348
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
call that in place
 

1349
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,350
call that in place
okay so those are our basic vocabulary

1350
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,360
okay so those are our basic vocabulary
 

1351
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,470
okay so those are our basic vocabulary
words and they're ways to kind of

1352
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
words and they're ways to kind of
 

1353
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,750
words and they're ways to kind of
understand the differences between

1354
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
understand the differences between
 

1355
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,630
understand the differences between
different sorting algorithms

1356
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640

 

1357
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,390

why do they end up using extra oh one

1358
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
why do they end up using extra oh one
 

1359
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,470
why do they end up using extra oh one
space oh yeah sure like any time

1360
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
space oh yeah sure like any time
 

1361
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,070
space oh yeah sure like any time
i just make a temporary variable like a

1362
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
i just make a temporary variable like a
 

1363
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,510
i just make a temporary variable like a
loop counter that

1364
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
loop counter that
 

1365
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,110
loop counter that
that's going to count toward that order

1366
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
that's going to count toward that order
 

1367
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,870
that's going to count toward that order
one but the important thing is that the

1368
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
one but the important thing is that the
 

1369
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,630
one but the important thing is that the
number of variables i need doesn't scale

1370
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
number of variables i need doesn't scale
 

1371
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,230
number of variables i need doesn't scale
in the length of the list

1372
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
in the length of the list
 

1373
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,590
in the length of the list
yep okay so i present to you the

1374
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
yep okay so i present to you the
 

1375
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,190
yep okay so i present to you the
beginning and end of our sorting lecture

1376
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
beginning and end of our sorting lecture
 

1377
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,390
beginning and end of our sorting lecture
which is the world's

1378
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
which is the world's
 

1379
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,029
which is the world's
simplest uh sorting algorithm i call it

1380
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
simplest uh sorting algorithm i call it
 

1381
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,710
simplest uh sorting algorithm i call it
permutation sort

1382
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
permutation sort
 

1383
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,830
permutation sort
i think it's very easy to prove

1384
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
i think it's very easy to prove
 

1385
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,950
i think it's very easy to prove
correctness for this particular

1386
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
correctness for this particular
 

1387
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,230
correctness for this particular
technique

1388
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
technique
 

1389
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,950
technique
uh so in permutation sort what can i do

1390
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
uh so in permutation sort what can i do
 

1391
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,070
uh so in permutation sort what can i do
well i know

1392
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
well i know
 

1393
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,390
well i know
that if i have an input that's a list of

1394
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
that if i have an input that's a list of
 

1395
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,750
that if i have an input that's a list of
numbers

1396
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
numbers
 

1397
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,470
numbers
there exists a permutation of that list

1398
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
there exists a permutation of that list
 

1399
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,870
there exists a permutation of that list
of numbers that is sorted

1400
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
of numbers that is sorted
 

1401
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,149
of numbers that is sorted
kind of by definition right because the

1402
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
kind of by definition right because the
 

1403
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,750
kind of by definition right because the
sword is a permutation of your original

1404
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
sword is a permutation of your original
 

1405
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,029
sword is a permutation of your original
list

1406
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
list
 

1407
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,630
list
so what is uh what's a very simple

1408
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
so what is uh what's a very simple
 

1409
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,149
so what is uh what's a very simple
sorting algorithm well

1410
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
sorting algorithm well
 

1411
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,630
sorting algorithm well
list every possible permutation

1412
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:04,640

 

1413
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,830

and then just double check which one's

1414
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
and then just double check which one's
 

1415
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,230
and then just double check which one's
in the right order yeah

1416
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,240
in the right order yeah
 

1417
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,789
in the right order yeah
so there's sort of two key uh pieces to

1418
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
so there's sort of two key uh pieces to
 

1419
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,310
so there's sort of two key uh pieces to
this particular technique if we want to

1420
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
this particular technique if we want to
 

1421
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,510
this particular technique if we want to
analyze it i don't see a reason to

1422
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
analyze it i don't see a reason to
 

1423
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,110
analyze it i don't see a reason to
belabor it too much

1424
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
belabor it too much
 

1425
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,270
belabor it too much
but there's sort of one is that we have

1426
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
but there's sort of one is that we have
 

1427
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,270
but there's sort of one is that we have
to enumerate

1428
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280

 

1429
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,950

the permutations

1430
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960

 

1431
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,029

now if i have a list of n numbers how

1432
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
now if i have a list of n numbers how
 

1433
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,870
now if i have a list of n numbers how
many different permutations of n numbers

1434
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
many different permutations of n numbers
 

1435
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,070
many different permutations of n numbers
are there

1436
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
are there
 

1437
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,750
are there
yes n factorial right

1438
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760
yes n factorial right
 

1439
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,909
yes n factorial right
so just by virtue of calling this

1440
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
so just by virtue of calling this
 

1441
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,470
so just by virtue of calling this
permutations function

1442
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
permutations function
 

1443
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,950
permutations function
i know that i incur at least n factorial

1444
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
i know that i incur at least n factorial
 

1445
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,070
i know that i incur at least n factorial
time

1446
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
time
 

1447
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,590
time
it might be worse right it might be that

1448
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
it might be worse right it might be that
 

1449
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,430
it might be worse right it might be that
like actually listing permutations takes

1450
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
like actually listing permutations takes
 

1451
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,870
like actually listing permutations takes
a lot of time for some reason like every

1452
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
a lot of time for some reason like every
 

1453
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,070
a lot of time for some reason like every
permutation itself takes

1454
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
permutation itself takes
 

1455
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,950
permutation itself takes
order and time but at the very least you

1456
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:50,960
order and time but at the very least you
 

1457
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,270
order and time but at the very least you
know each one of these things looks like

1458
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,280
know each one of these things looks like
 

1459
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,430
know each one of these things looks like
n factorial i want you my my handwriting

1460
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
n factorial i want you my my handwriting
 

1461
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,630
n factorial i want you my my handwriting
is terrible

1462
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
is terrible
 

1463
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,990
is terrible
all right so that's what this omega

1464
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
all right so that's what this omega
 

1465
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,390
all right so that's what this omega
thing is doing if i recall properly

1466
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
thing is doing if i recall properly
 

1467
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,110
thing is doing if i recall properly
uh and then secondarily well we've got

1468
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
uh and then secondarily well we've got
 

1469
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,510
uh and then secondarily well we've got
to check

1470
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
to check
 

1471
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,350
to check
if that particular permutation is sorted

1472
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
if that particular permutation is sorted
 

1473
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,549
if that particular permutation is sorted
um

1474
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559

 

1475
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,350

how are we going to do that well there's

1476
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
how are we going to do that well there's
 

1477
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,950
how are we going to do that well there's
a very easy way to check if a list is

1478
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:20,960
a very easy way to check if a list is
 

1479
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,549
a very easy way to check if a list is
sorted right i'm gonna do

1480
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
sorted right i'm gonna do
 

1481
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,590
sorted right i'm gonna do
maybe four i

1482
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
maybe four i
 

1483
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,630
maybe four i
equals one two and minus one

1484
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:28,640
equals one two and minus one
 

1485
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,470
equals one two and minus one
notice not not a python quota it's gonna

1486
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
notice not not a python quota it's gonna
 

1487
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,149
notice not not a python quota it's gonna
look a little different right

1488
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
look a little different right
 

1489
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,190
look a little different right
then check you know is b

1490
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
then check you know is b
 

1491
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,549
then check you know is b
i less than or equal to

1492
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
i less than or equal to
 

1493
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,909
i less than or equal to
b i uh

1494
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
b i uh
 

1495
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,950
b i uh
plus one right and so if this uh

1496
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960
plus one right and so if this uh
 

1497
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,430
plus one right and so if this uh
uh relationship is true for every single

1498
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
uh relationship is true for every single
 

1499
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,590
uh relationship is true for every single
i that's supposed to be a question mark

1500
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
i that's supposed to be a question mark
 

1501
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,950
i that's supposed to be a question mark
right this was less than or equal to

1502
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960
right this was less than or equal to
 

1503
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,549
right this was less than or equal to
with a question mark over it it was my

1504
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
with a question mark over it it was my
 

1505
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,830
with a question mark over it it was my
special notation

1506
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
special notation
 

1507
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,110
special notation
right so if i get all the way to the end

1508
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
right so if i get all the way to the end
 

1509
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,310
right so if i get all the way to the end
of this for loop and this is true

1510
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
of this for loop and this is true
 

1511
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,190
of this for loop and this is true
everywhere

1512
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
everywhere
 

1513
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,430
everywhere
then my list is sorted and and life is

1514
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
then my list is sorted and and life is
 

1515
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,350
then my list is sorted and and life is
good

1516
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
good
 

1517
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,950
good
right so how long does this algorithm

1518
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
right so how long does this algorithm
 

1519
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,230
right so how long does this algorithm
take what's kind of staring you right in

1520
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
take what's kind of staring you right in
 

1521
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,350
take what's kind of staring you right in
the face right because you have an

1522
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
the face right because you have an
 

1523
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:05,990
the face right because you have an
algorithm

1524
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
algorithm
 

1525
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,950
algorithm
which is looping from one to n minus one

1526
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
which is looping from one to n minus one
 

1527
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,269
which is looping from one to n minus one
so

1528
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:09,279
so
 

1529
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,549
so
this step incurs order n time i guess

1530
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
this step incurs order n time i guess
 

1531
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,669
this step incurs order n time i guess
theta event time

1532
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
theta event time
 

1533
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,789
theta event time
because we gotta go all the way into the

1534
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
because we gotta go all the way into the
 

1535
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,390
because we gotta go all the way into the
list so when i put these things together

1536
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
list so when i put these things together
 

1537
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,590
list so when i put these things together
permutation sort well remember that

1538
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
permutation sort well remember that
 

1539
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,990
permutation sort well remember that
this check if sorted happens for every

1540
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,000
this check if sorted happens for every
 

1541
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,669
this check if sorted happens for every
single permutation

1542
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
single permutation
 

1543
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,350
single permutation
so at the end of the day our algorithm

1544
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
so at the end of the day our algorithm
 

1545
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,750
so at the end of the day our algorithm
takes at least

1546
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
takes at least
 

1547
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,710
takes at least
n factorial times n time

1548
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:34,720
n factorial times n time
 

1549
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,149
n factorial times n time
it's a great example of something that's

1550
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
it's a great example of something that's
 

1551
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,750
it's a great example of something that's
even worse

1552
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
even worse
 

1553
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,510
even worse
than n factorial which somehow in my

1554
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
than n factorial which somehow in my
 

1555
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,710
than n factorial which somehow in my
head is like the worst possible

1556
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
head is like the worst possible
 

1557
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,750
head is like the worst possible
algorithm

1558
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
algorithm
 

1559
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,390
algorithm
yeah so do you think that python

1560
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400
yeah so do you think that python
 

1561
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,149
yeah so do you think that python
implements permutation sword

1562
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
implements permutation sword
 

1563
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,669
implements permutation sword
i certainly hope not yes

1564
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679

 

1565
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,029

right so the question was why is it

1566
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
right so the question was why is it
 

1567
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,110
right so the question was why is it
omega and not big o which is a fabulous

1568
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
omega and not big o which is a fabulous
 

1569
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,549
omega and not big o which is a fabulous
question in this course

1570
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
question in this course
 

1571
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,630
question in this course
so here's the basic issue i haven't

1572
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
so here's the basic issue i haven't
 

1573
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,070
so here's the basic issue i haven't
given you an algorithm for how to

1574
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
given you an algorithm for how to
 

1575
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,029
given you an algorithm for how to
compute

1576
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
compute
 

1577
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,630
compute
the set of permutations for a list of

1578
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
the set of permutations for a list of
 

1579
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,549
the set of permutations for a list of
numbers i just kind of call some magic

1580
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
numbers i just kind of call some magic
 

1581
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,149
numbers i just kind of call some magic
function that i made up

1582
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
function that i made up
 

1583
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,990
function that i made up
but i know that that algorithm takes at

1584
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
but i know that that algorithm takes at
 

1585
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,230
but i know that that algorithm takes at
least n factorial time in some sense or

1586
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
least n factorial time in some sense or
 

1587
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,070
least n factorial time in some sense or
if nothing else the list of permutations

1588
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
if nothing else the list of permutations
 

1589
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,590
if nothing else the list of permutations
is n factorial big

1590
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
is n factorial big
 

1591
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,710
is n factorial big
because that's all the stuff i have to

1592
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
because that's all the stuff i have to
 

1593
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,350
because that's all the stuff i have to
compute so i haven't told you how to

1594
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
compute so i haven't told you how to
 

1595
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,630
compute so i haven't told you how to
solve this problem but i'm convinced

1596
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
solve this problem but i'm convinced
 

1597
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,470
solve this problem but i'm convinced
that at least this amount of time

1598
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
that at least this amount of time
 

1599
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,950
that at least this amount of time
so remember that omega means lower bound

1600
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
so remember that omega means lower bound
 

1601
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,950
so remember that omega means lower bound
right so when i put it all together

1602
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
right so when i put it all together
 

1603
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,590
right so when i put it all together
in some sense okay this isn't satisfying

1604
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
in some sense okay this isn't satisfying
 

1605
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:27,990
in some sense okay this isn't satisfying
in the sense

1606
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
in the sense
 

1607
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,269
in the sense
that i didn't give you precisely the

1608
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
that i didn't give you precisely the
 

1609
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,029
that i didn't give you precisely the
runtime of this algorithm but hopefully

1610
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
runtime of this algorithm but hopefully
 

1611
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,149
runtime of this algorithm but hopefully
i've convinced you that it's super

1612
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
i've convinced you that it's super
 

1613
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,590
i've convinced you that it's super
useless

1614
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
useless
 

1615
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,549
useless
yeah okay any other questions about that

1616
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
yeah okay any other questions about that
 

1617
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,149
yeah okay any other questions about that
but great so so if we go back to our

1618
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
but great so so if we go back to our
 

1619
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,470
but great so so if we go back to our
table for the set interface

1620
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
table for the set interface
 

1621
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,070
table for the set interface
well in some sense if we implemented it

1622
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
well in some sense if we implemented it
 

1623
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,830
well in some sense if we implemented it
using this goofy algorithm

1624
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
using this goofy algorithm
 

1625
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,070
using this goofy algorithm
then the lower left entry in our table

1626
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
then the lower left entry in our table
 

1627
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,830
then the lower left entry in our table
would be n factorial times n which

1628
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:49,840
would be n factorial times n which
 

1629
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,269
would be n factorial times n which
wouldn't be so hot

1630
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
wouldn't be so hot
 

1631
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,350
wouldn't be so hot
but notice that actually all the rest of

1632
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
but notice that actually all the rest of
 

1633
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,110
but notice that actually all the rest of
our our operations are not quite

1634
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
our our operations are not quite
 

1635
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,870
our our operations are not quite
efficient right i can use binary search

1636
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
efficient right i can use binary search
 

1637
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,669
efficient right i can use binary search
i just

1638
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
i just
 

1639
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,149
i just
obtain the algorithm that i rather

1640
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
obtain the algorithm that i rather
 

1641
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,350
obtain the algorithm that i rather
obtain the sorted array

1642
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
obtain the sorted array
 

1643
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,470
obtain the sorted array
in kind of a funny fashion okay so let's

1644
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
in kind of a funny fashion okay so let's
 

1645
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,510
in kind of a funny fashion okay so let's
let's fill in some more interesting

1646
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
let's fill in some more interesting
 

1647
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,710
let's fill in some more interesting
algorithms

1648
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
algorithms
 

1649
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,870
algorithms
as usual i'm talking too much and i'm

1650
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
as usual i'm talking too much and i'm
 

1651
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,549
as usual i'm talking too much and i'm
nervous about the time but we can we can

1652
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
nervous about the time but we can we can
 

1653
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,549
nervous about the time but we can we can
skip one of them if we need to

1654
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
skip one of them if we need to
 

1655
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,430
skip one of them if we need to
okay so uh i'm gonna have seen uh

1656
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,440
okay so uh i'm gonna have seen uh
 

1657
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,590
okay so uh i'm gonna have seen uh
selection sort before

1658
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
selection sort before
 

1659
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,029
selection sort before
i see your hand but we're gonna defer

1660
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039
i see your hand but we're gonna defer
 

1661
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,350
i see your hand but we're gonna defer
for a little bit i'm sorry

1662
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360

 

1663
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,029

uh that's fabulous why don't we defer to

1664
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
uh that's fabulous why don't we defer to
 

1665
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,549
uh that's fabulous why don't we defer to
the end of lecture and we'll we'll do it

1666
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:26,559
the end of lecture and we'll we'll do it
 

1667
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,350
the end of lecture and we'll we'll do it
then

1668
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
then
 

1669
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,909
then
okay so so uh the first algorithm that

1670
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
okay so so uh the first algorithm that
 

1671
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,269
okay so so uh the first algorithm that
we'll talk about for sorting which is

1672
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
we'll talk about for sorting which is
 

1673
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,390
we'll talk about for sorting which is
somewhat sensible

1674
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,400
somewhat sensible
 

1675
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,630
somewhat sensible
uh is something called selection sort

1676
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
uh is something called selection sort
 

1677
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,990
uh is something called selection sort
selection source exactly what it sounds

1678
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
selection source exactly what it sounds
 

1679
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,110
selection source exactly what it sounds
like

1680
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,120
like
 

1681
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,029
like
so uh let's say that we have a list of

1682
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
so uh let's say that we have a list of
 

1683
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,590
so uh let's say that we have a list of
oops my laptop and the screen are not

1684
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
oops my laptop and the screen are not
 

1685
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,070
oops my laptop and the screen are not
agreed

1686
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
agreed
 

1687
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,190
agreed
okay let's say i have a list of numbers

1688
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,200
okay let's say i have a list of numbers
 

1689
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,310
okay let's say i have a list of numbers
82493

1690
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
82493
 

1691
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,630
82493
this is a message that jason i think is

1692
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,640
this is a message that jason i think is
 

1693
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,750
this is a message that jason i think is
sending me in the course notes but i

1694
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:49,760
sending me in the course notes but i
 

1695
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,230
sending me in the course notes but i
haven't figured it out uh

1696
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,240
haven't figured it out uh
 

1697
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,470
haven't figured it out uh
but in any event and i want to sort uh

1698
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
but in any event and i want to sort uh
 

1699
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,630
but in any event and i want to sort uh
this list of numbers

1700
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
this list of numbers
 

1701
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,070
this list of numbers
here's a simple algorithm for how to do

1702
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
here's a simple algorithm for how to do
 

1703
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,990
here's a simple algorithm for how to do
it which is i can find the

1704
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000
it which is i can find the
 

1705
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,990
it which is i can find the
biggest number in this whole list and

1706
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
biggest number in this whole list and
 

1707
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,830
biggest number in this whole list and
stick it at the end

1708
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
stick it at the end
 

1709
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,510
stick it at the end
yeah so in this case what's the biggest

1710
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
yeah so in this case what's the biggest
 

1711
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,830
yeah so in this case what's the biggest
number in this list everybody

1712
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
number in this list everybody
 

1713
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,470
number in this list everybody
nine good see this is why you go to mit

1714
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
nine good see this is why you go to mit
 

1715
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,190
nine good see this is why you go to mit
okay so

1716
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,200
okay so
 

1717
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,590
okay so
uh i'm gonna take that nine i'll find it

1718
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
uh i'm gonna take that nine i'll find it
 

1719
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,029
uh i'm gonna take that nine i'll find it
and then swap it out with the

1720
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,039
and then swap it out with the
 

1721
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,750
and then swap it out with the
the three which is at the end and now

1722
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
the three which is at the end and now
 

1723
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,510
the three which is at the end and now
what's my sort of inductive hypothesis

1724
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
what's my sort of inductive hypothesis
 

1725
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,190
what's my sort of inductive hypothesis
well in some sense it's that everything

1726
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,200
well in some sense it's that everything
 

1727
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,470
well in some sense it's that everything
to the right of this little red line

1728
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
to the right of this little red line
 

1729
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,230
to the right of this little red line
that i've drawn here is in sorted order

1730
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,240
that i've drawn here is in sorted order
 

1731
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,350
that i've drawn here is in sorted order
in this case because there's only one

1732
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,360
in this case because there's only one
 

1733
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,350
in this case because there's only one
thing yeah

1734
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,360
thing yeah
 

1735
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,389
thing yeah
so now what am i going to do i'm going

1736
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:28,399
so now what am i going to do i'm going
 

1737
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,230
so now what am i going to do i'm going
to look to the left of the red line find

1738
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
to look to the left of the red line find
 

1739
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,070
to look to the left of the red line find
the next biggest thing

1740
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,080
the next biggest thing
 

1741
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,789
the next biggest thing
what's that oh come on

1742
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
what's that oh come on
 

1743
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,510
what's that oh come on
there we go yeah yeah wake up okay so uh

1744
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520
there we go yeah yeah wake up okay so uh
 

1745
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,870
there we go yeah yeah wake up okay so uh
right so the next biggest one is the

1746
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
right so the next biggest one is the
 

1747
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,070
right so the next biggest one is the
eight so we're gonna swap it with the

1748
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,080
eight so we're gonna swap it with the
 

1749
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,870
eight so we're gonna swap it with the
three

1750
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
three
 

1751
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,269
three
put it at the end and so on i think you

1752
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:45,279
put it at the end and so on i think you
 

1753
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,269
put it at the end and so on i think you
guys could all finish this off

1754
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:47,279
guys could all finish this off
 

1755
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,870
guys could all finish this off
i suppose there should be one last line

1756
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:48,880
i suppose there should be one last line
 

1757
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,310
i suppose there should be one last line
here where everything is green and we're

1758
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
here where everything is green and we're
 

1759
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,110
here where everything is green and we're
happy but

1760
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
happy but
 

1761
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,110
happy but
but in some sense we're pretty sure that

1762
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
but in some sense we're pretty sure that
 

1763
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,310
but in some sense we're pretty sure that
an array of one item is in sorted order

1764
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
an array of one item is in sorted order
 

1765
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,389
an array of one item is in sorted order
uh and so essentially from a high level

1766
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
uh and so essentially from a high level
 

1767
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,230
uh and so essentially from a high level
what did selection sort do

1768
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
what did selection sort do
 

1769
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,230
what did selection sort do
well it just kept choosing the element

1770
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
well it just kept choosing the element
 

1771
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,430
well it just kept choosing the element
which was the biggest

1772
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,440
which was the biggest
 

1773
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,269
which was the biggest
and swapping it into the back and then

1774
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
and swapping it into the back and then
 

1775
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,950
and swapping it into the back and then
iterating

1776
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
iterating
 

1777
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,190
iterating
now in 6006 we're going to write

1778
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
now in 6006 we're going to write
 

1779
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,470
now in 6006 we're going to write
selection sort in a way that you might

1780
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:10,480
selection sort in a way that you might
 

1781
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,149
selection sort in a way that you might
not be familiar with

1782
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
not be familiar with
 

1783
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,549
not be familiar with
uh in some sense this is not so hard to

1784
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:14,559
uh in some sense this is not so hard to
 

1785
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,909
uh in some sense this is not so hard to
implement with two for loops i think you

1786
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:15,919
implement with two for loops i think you
 

1787
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,110
implement with two for loops i think you
guys could all do this at home in fact

1788
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,120
guys could all do this at home in fact
 

1789
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,710
guys could all do this at home in fact
you may have already

1790
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
you may have already
 

1791
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,830
you may have already
but in this class because we're

1792
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
but in this class because we're
 

1793
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,830
but in this class because we're
concerned with proving correctness

1794
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
concerned with proving correctness
 

1795
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,149
concerned with proving correctness
proving efficiency all that good stuff

1796
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:24,159
proving efficiency all that good stuff
 

1797
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,269
proving efficiency all that good stuff
we're going to write it in kind of a

1798
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
we're going to write it in kind of a
 

1799
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,029
we're going to write it in kind of a
funny way which is recursive

1800
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
funny way which is recursive
 

1801
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,350
funny way which is recursive
now i can't emphasize strongly enough

1802
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
now i can't emphasize strongly enough
 

1803
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,269
now i can't emphasize strongly enough
how little

1804
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
how little
 

1805
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,870
how little
you guys should implement this at home

1806
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:34,880
you guys should implement this at home
 

1807
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,630
you guys should implement this at home
this is mostly a theoretical version of

1808
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
this is mostly a theoretical version of
 

1809
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,590
this is mostly a theoretical version of
selection sort

1810
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
selection sort
 

1811
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,789
selection sort
rather than one that you would actually

1812
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:38,799
rather than one that you would actually
 

1813
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,389
rather than one that you would actually
want to write in code because there's

1814
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
want to write in code because there's
 

1815
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,669
want to write in code because there's
obviously much better way to do it and

1816
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
obviously much better way to do it and
 

1817
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,269
obviously much better way to do it and
you'll see that in your recitation this

1818
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279
you'll see that in your recitation this
 

1819
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,389
you'll see that in your recitation this
week i believe

1820
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
week i believe
 

1821
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,950
week i believe
um but in terms of analysis there's a

1822
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
um but in terms of analysis there's a
 

1823
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,269
um but in terms of analysis there's a
nice easy way to write it down

1824
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
nice easy way to write it down
 

1825
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,870
nice easy way to write it down
so we're going to sort of take the

1826
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
so we're going to sort of take the
 

1827
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,950
so we're going to sort of take the
selection sort algorithm

1828
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
selection sort algorithm
 

1829
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,549
selection sort algorithm
and we're going to divide it into two

1830
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559
and we're going to divide it into two
 

1831
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,470
and we're going to divide it into two
kind of chunks right one of them

1832
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
kind of chunks right one of them
 

1833
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,029
kind of chunks right one of them
is find me the biggest thing in the

1834
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
is find me the biggest thing in the
 

1835
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,909
is find me the biggest thing in the
first

1836
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
first
 

1837
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,070
first
k elements of my array i shouldn't use k

1838
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,080
k elements of my array i shouldn't use k
 

1839
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,950
k elements of my array i shouldn't use k
because that means key

1840
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:02,960
because that means key
 

1841
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,830
because that means key
the first i elements of my array and the

1842
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
the first i elements of my array and the
 

1843
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,310
the first i elements of my array and the
next one

1844
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,320
next one
 

1845
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,070
next one
is to swap it into place and then sort

1846
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
is to swap it into place and then sort
 

1847
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,269
is to swap it into place and then sort
everything to the left right that's sort

1848
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
everything to the left right that's sort
 

1849
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,470
everything to the left right that's sort
of the two pieces here so

1850
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
of the two pieces here so
 

1851
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,389
of the two pieces here so
let's write that down right

1852
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
let's write that down right
 

1853
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,909
let's write that down right
so what did i do well in some sense in

1854
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
so what did i do well in some sense in
 

1855
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,830
so what did i do well in some sense in
step one here

1856
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
step one here
 

1857
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,070
step one here
i found the biggest uh

1858
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
i found the biggest uh
 

1859
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,510
i found the biggest uh
uh with index

1860
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,520

 

1861
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,430

less than or equal to i right so i

1862
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
less than or equal to i right so i
 

1863
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,789
less than or equal to i right so i
started at the end of the list and then

1864
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799
started at the end of the list and then
 

1865
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,310
started at the end of the list and then
kind of moved backward

1866
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
kind of moved backward
 

1867
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,310
kind of moved backward
right and then uh step two

1868
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
right and then uh step two
 

1869
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,669
right and then uh step two
was to swap that into place notice when

1870
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
was to swap that into place notice when
 

1871
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,190
was to swap that into place notice when
i say swap so for instance when i put

1872
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
i say swap so for instance when i put
 

1873
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,389
i say swap so for instance when i put
the eight there

1874
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:44,399
the eight there
 

1875
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,590
the eight there
well i had to do something with that

1876
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
well i had to do something with that
 

1877
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,789
well i had to do something with that
three so i just put it where the eight

1878
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:46,799
three so i just put it where the eight
 

1879
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,630
three so i just put it where the eight
used to be

1880
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
used to be
 

1881
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,310
used to be
and then finally

1882
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320

 

1883
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,149

well am i done no i just put the biggest

1884
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
well am i done no i just put the biggest
 

1885
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,990
well am i done no i just put the biggest
thing at the end of my array

1886
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,000
thing at the end of my array
 

1887
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,950
thing at the end of my array
so now i have to sort from index one to

1888
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
so now i have to sort from index one to
 

1889
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,990
so now i have to sort from index one to
i minus one

1890
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,000
i minus one
 

1891
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,590
i minus one
right because now i know that the last

1892
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:01,600
right because now i know that the last
 

1893
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,110
right because now i know that the last
guy is in sorted order

1894
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
guy is in sorted order
 

1895
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:11,110
guy is in sorted order
i see i'll return again just a second so

1896
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,120

 

1897
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,789

yes you can't read the handwriting

1898
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799

 

1899
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,590

this is index less than or equal to i

1900
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
this is index less than or equal to i
 

1901
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,669
this is index less than or equal to i
great question

1902
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
great question
 

1903
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,909
great question
i warned you it's going to be a problem

1904
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:23,919
i warned you it's going to be a problem
 

1905
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:24,870
i warned you it's going to be a problem
okay

1906
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:24,880
okay
 

1907
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,669
okay
uh so let's uh let's do step one uh

1908
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:27,679
uh so let's uh let's do step one uh
 

1909
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,110
uh so let's uh let's do step one uh
first

1910
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
first
 

1911
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,269
first
uh so i'm gonna put code on the board uh

1912
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:31,279
uh so i'm gonna put code on the board uh
 

1913
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,789
uh so i'm gonna put code on the board uh
and then we're gonna fill in the details

1914
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:34,799
and then we're gonna fill in the details
 

1915
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,029
and then we're gonna fill in the details
eric is posting on facebook i'm going to

1916
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:37,039
eric is posting on facebook i'm going to
 

1917
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,950
eric is posting on facebook i'm going to
turn that feature off on my watch later

1918
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
turn that feature off on my watch later
 

1919
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,070
turn that feature off on my watch later
uh okay so uh right the uh

1920
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
uh okay so uh right the uh
 

1921
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,070
uh okay so uh right the uh
let's let's let's uh let's implement

1922
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,080
let's let's let's uh let's implement
 

1923
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,669
let's let's let's uh let's implement
this this helper function here

1924
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:45,679
this this helper function here
 

1925
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,710
this this helper function here
this is something we're going to call

1926
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
this is something we're going to call
 

1927
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,190
this is something we're going to call
prefix max and this is going to find me

prefix max and this is going to find me
the biggest element of array

1930
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,600
the biggest element of array
 

1931
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,950
the biggest element of array
between index 0 and index i inclusive i

1932
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
between index 0 and index i inclusive i
 

1933
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,430
between index 0 and index i inclusive i
believe

1934
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
believe
 

1935
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,789
believe
yeah well here's an interesting

1936
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:58,799
yeah well here's an interesting
 

1937
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,590
yeah well here's an interesting
observation

1938
00:30:59,590 --> 00:30:59,600
observation
 

1939
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,630
observation
really a deep one which is the

1940
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,640
really a deep one which is the
 

1941
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,149
really a deep one which is the
the biggest

1942
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159

 

1943
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,789

uh element from zero to i

1944
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:10,799
uh element from zero to i
 

1945
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,149
uh element from zero to i
that's an i sorry uh there's sort of two

1946
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
that's an i sorry uh there's sort of two
 

1947
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:14,950
that's an i sorry uh there's sort of two
cases

1948
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:14,960
cases
 

1949
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,070
cases
right either

1950
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
right either
 

1951
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,830
right either
it's uh

1952
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,840

 

1953
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,669

at index i

1954
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
at index i
 

1955
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,190
at index i
meaning like i have the first 10

1956
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
meaning like i have the first 10
 

1957
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,269
meaning like i have the first 10
elements of my array either

1958
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
elements of my array either
 

1959
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,630
elements of my array either
it is element number 10 or

1960
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
it is element number 10 or
 

1961
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,149
it is element number 10 or
what's the other case it ain't yeah

1962
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
what's the other case it ain't yeah
 

1963
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,669
what's the other case it ain't yeah
in other words

1964
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679

 

1965
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,909

it has index

1966
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
it has index
 

1967
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,909
it has index
less than i this is kind of a tautology

1968
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
less than i this is kind of a tautology
 

1969
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,350
less than i this is kind of a tautology
right like either the biggest thing is

1970
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,360
right like either the biggest thing is
 

1971
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,710
right like either the biggest thing is
at this index or it's not

1972
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
at this index or it's not
 

1973
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,710
at this index or it's not
in which case it has to be to the left

1974
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:52,720
in which case it has to be to the left
 

1975
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,470
in which case it has to be to the left
does that make sense

1976
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
does that make sense
 

1977
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,149
does that make sense
so this gives us a really simple

1978
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:56,159
so this gives us a really simple
 

1979
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,870
so this gives us a really simple
algorithm for finding the biggest

1980
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:58,880
algorithm for finding the biggest
 

1981
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,789
algorithm for finding the biggest
element in the array between index zero

1982
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
element in the array between index zero
 

1983
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,990
element in the array between index zero
and index i

1984
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,000
and index i
 

1985
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,110
and index i
which is what i've shown you on the

1986
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
which is what i've shown you on the
 

1987
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,630
which is what i've shown you on the
screen here i'd write it on the board

1988
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:04,640
screen here i'd write it on the board
 

1989
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,470
screen here i'd write it on the board
but i am a slow writer and already low

1990
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,480
but i am a slow writer and already low
 

1991
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,909
but i am a slow writer and already low
on time

1992
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:07,919
on time
 

1993
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,389
on time
and so essentially what did i implement

1994
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:10,399
and so essentially what did i implement
 

1995
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,029
and so essentially what did i implement
well i

1996
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
well i
 

1997
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,710
well i
found the biggest element between

1998
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
found the biggest element between
 

1999
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,750
found the biggest element between
index 0 and index i minus 1

2000
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
index 0 and index i minus 1
 

2001
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,830
index 0 and index i minus 1
right so if i have let's say that i have

2002
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:19,840
right so if i have let's say that i have
 

2003
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,789
right so if i have let's say that i have
an array

2004
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799

 

2005
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,710

i forget the sequence of numbers like 8

2006
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
i forget the sequence of numbers like 8
 

2007
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,990
i forget the sequence of numbers like 8
3 5

2008
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
3 5
 

2009
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,110
3 5
7 9. that'll do it yeah

2010
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
7 9. that'll do it yeah
 

2011
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,269
7 9. that'll do it yeah
and so like i give a pointer here which

2012
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:31,279
and so like i give a pointer here which
 

2013
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,269
and so like i give a pointer here which
is i

2014
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
is i
 

2015
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,549
is i
right then the very first thing that i

2016
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:34,559
right then the very first thing that i
 

2017
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,470
right then the very first thing that i
do is i compute

2018
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:36,480
do is i compute
 

2019
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,750
do is i compute
the biggest number all the way to the

2020
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
the biggest number all the way to the
 

2021
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,269
the biggest number all the way to the
left of this stuff in this case that is

2022
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
left of this stuff in this case that is
 

2023
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,310
left of this stuff in this case that is
eight there we go

2024
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320

 

2025
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,990

now i look at the very last element of

2026
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000
now i look at the very last element of
 

2027
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,149
now i look at the very last element of
my array which is

2028
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
my array which is
 

2029
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,269
my array which is
nine are you killing me today guys okay

2030
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:51,279
nine are you killing me today guys okay
 

2031
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,710
nine are you killing me today guys okay
and then what do i return well i want

2032
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
and then what do i return well i want
 

2033
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,789
and then what do i return well i want
the biggest one between zero

2034
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
the biggest one between zero
 

2035
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,789
the biggest one between zero
and index i so in this case i return

2036
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
and index i so in this case i return
 

2037
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,230
and index i so in this case i return
the nine that makes sense so

2038
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,240
the nine that makes sense so
 

2039
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,750
the nine that makes sense so
you know there's this uh i know jerry

2040
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
you know there's this uh i know jerry
 

2041
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,430
you know there's this uh i know jerry
kane at stanford likes to talk about the

2042
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
kane at stanford likes to talk about the
 

2043
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:05,909
kane at stanford likes to talk about the
uh

2044
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
uh
 

2045
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,070
uh
what is it the recursive leap of faith

2046
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080
what is it the recursive leap of faith
 

2047
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,070
what is it the recursive leap of faith
that happens uh another term for this is

2048
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
that happens uh another term for this is
 

2049
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,269
that happens uh another term for this is
induction

2050
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
induction
 

2051
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,190
induction
right so we want to prove that our uh

2052
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
right so we want to prove that our uh
 

2053
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,630
right so we want to prove that our uh
our algorithm works

2054
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
our algorithm works
 

2055
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,830
our algorithm works
well what do we have to do we have to

2056
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:15,840
well what do we have to do we have to
 

2057
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,830
well what do we have to do we have to
show that when i call this function

2058
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
show that when i call this function
 

2059
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,190
show that when i call this function
it gives me the max of my array between

2060
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
it gives me the max of my array between
 

2061
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,710
it gives me the max of my array between
index 0 and index i

2062
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:22,720
index 0 and index i
 

2063
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,669
index 0 and index i
for all i right so let's maybe do this

2064
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:25,679
for all i right so let's maybe do this
 

2065
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,110
for all i right so let's maybe do this
inductive proof a little bit carefully

2066
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
inductive proof a little bit carefully
 

2067
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,230
inductive proof a little bit carefully
and then the rest will be we'll be

2068
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240
and then the rest will be we'll be
 

2069
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,430
and then the rest will be we'll be
sloppy about it

2070
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,440
sloppy about it
 

2071
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,110
sloppy about it
right so the base uh case

2072
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,120
right so the base uh case
 

2073
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,029
right so the base uh case
is i equals zero right well in this case

2074
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
is i equals zero right well in this case
 

2075
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,789
is i equals zero right well in this case
there's only one element in my array so

2076
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:38,799
there's only one element in my array so
 

2077
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,310
there's only one element in my array so
it's pretty clear that it's the max

2078
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
it's pretty clear that it's the max
 

2079
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,269
it's pretty clear that it's the max
right

2080
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279

 

2081
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,310

okay and now we have to do our inductive

2082
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,320
okay and now we have to do our inductive
 

2083
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,549
okay and now we have to do our inductive
step

2084
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
step
 

2085
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,950
step
right which means that if i call prefix

2086
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:52,960
right which means that if i call prefix
 

2087
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,190
right which means that if i call prefix
max with i minus 1 i really do

2088
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
max with i minus 1 i really do
 

2089
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,230
max with i minus 1 i really do
get the max of my array between 0 and

2090
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,240
get the max of my array between 0 and
 

2091
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,149
get the max of my array between 0 and
index i minus 1

2092
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:00,159
index i minus 1
 

2093
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,669
index i minus 1
and then really i can just look at my

2094
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
and then really i can just look at my
 

2095
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,509
and then really i can just look at my
proof

2096
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:03,519
proof
 

2097
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,470
proof
my very deep statement which is that

2098
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480
my very deep statement which is that
 

2099
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,430
my very deep statement which is that
either

2100
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,440
either
 

2101
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,190
either
my object is at the end of the array or

2102
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
my object is at the end of the array or
 

2103
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,310
my object is at the end of the array or
it's not

2104
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,320

 

2105
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,829

and this is precisely what we need to

2106
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
and this is precisely what we need to
 

2107
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,589
and this is precisely what we need to
justify the inductive step

2108
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
justify the inductive step
 

2109
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,750
justify the inductive step
right essentially there are two cases

2110
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
right essentially there are two cases
 

2111
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,349
right essentially there are two cases
either the biggest element of my array

2112
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:19,359
either the biggest element of my array
 

2113
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,069
either the biggest element of my array
is the last one

2114
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,079
is the last one
 

2115
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,030
is the last one
or it's not we already by our inductive

2116
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
or it's not we already by our inductive
 

2117
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,909
or it's not we already by our inductive
hypothesis

2118
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:23,919
hypothesis
 

2119
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:25,589
hypothesis
have argued that our code can find the

2120
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
have argued that our code can find the
 

2121
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,270
have argued that our code can find the
biggest element between

2122
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,280
biggest element between
 

2123
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,190
biggest element between
index 0 and index i minus 1.

2124
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,200
index 0 and index i minus 1.
 

2125
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,790
index 0 and index i minus 1.
so as long as we take the max of that

2126
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:32,800
so as long as we take the max of that
 

2127
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,230
so as long as we take the max of that
and the very last guy we're in good

2128
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,240
and the very last guy we're in good
 

2129
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,109
and the very last guy we're in good
shape

2130
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:35,119
shape
 

2131
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,270
shape
okay so this is our our sort of very

2132
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,280
okay so this is our our sort of very
 

2133
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,470
okay so this is our our sort of very
informal proof of correctness

2134
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:40,480
informal proof of correctness
 

2135
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,629
informal proof of correctness
okay so now we have to to justify

2136
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
okay so now we have to to justify
 

2137
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,230
okay so now we have to to justify
runtime for this algorithm and that's

2138
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,240
runtime for this algorithm and that's
 

2139
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,909
runtime for this algorithm and that's
like actually not 100 obvious from the

2140
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
like actually not 100 obvious from the
 

2141
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:46,869
like actually not 100 obvious from the
way i've written it here right there's

2142
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
way i've written it here right there's
 

2143
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,030
way i've written it here right there's
no for loop

2144
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,040
no for loop
 

2145
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,829
no for loop
but what do i do well in some sense if

2146
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
but what do i do well in some sense if
 

2147
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,190
but what do i do well in some sense if
my runtime is a function

2148
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
my runtime is a function
 

2149
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,230
my runtime is a function
s well for one thing

2150
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
s well for one thing
 

2151
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,430
s well for one thing
if my array has one element in it

2152
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
if my array has one element in it
 

2153
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,190
if my array has one element in it
well my runtime you know it might be

2154
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
well my runtime you know it might be
 

2155
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,630
well my runtime you know it might be
seven it might be 23

2156
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
seven it might be 23
 

2157
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,390
seven it might be 23
but at the end of the day it only does

2158
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,400
but at the end of the day it only does
 

2159
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,829
but at the end of the day it only does
one thing it just returns i

2160
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:05,839
one thing it just returns i
 

2161
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,390
one thing it just returns i
right so in other words it's theta of

2162
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
right so in other words it's theta of
 

2163
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,109
right so in other words it's theta of
one

2164
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119

 

2165
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,349

this isn't terribly insightful but what

2166
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:13,359
this isn't terribly insightful but what
 

2167
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,790
this isn't terribly insightful but what
else do we know well

2168
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:14,800
else do we know well
 

2169
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,150
else do we know well
when i call my function i call it

2170
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
when i call my function i call it
 

2171
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,910
when i call my function i call it
recursively on

2172
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:17,920
recursively on
 

2173
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,829
recursively on
one smaller index and then i do a

2174
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:19,839
one smaller index and then i do a
 

2175
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,270
one smaller index and then i do a
constant amount of work

2176
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,280
constant amount of work
 

2177
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,470
constant amount of work
so i know that s of n is equal to

2178
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,480
so i know that s of n is equal to
 

2179
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,750
so i know that s of n is equal to
s of n minus one plus

2180
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:27,760
s of n minus one plus
 

2181
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,670
s of n minus one plus
theta of one right i do a little bit of

2182
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
theta of one right i do a little bit of
 

2183
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,310
theta of one right i do a little bit of
extra computation on top of that

2184
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,320
extra computation on top of that
 

2185
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,910
extra computation on top of that
anybody guess what this total run time

2186
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
anybody guess what this total run time
 

2187
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,870
anybody guess what this total run time
is going to be

2188
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880

 

2189
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,910

yes yeah order n right

2190
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
yes yeah order n right
 

2191
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,510
yes yeah order n right
so let's say that we hypothesize that

2192
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
so let's say that we hypothesize that
 

2193
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,030
so let's say that we hypothesize that
this takes end time kind of see that

2194
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
this takes end time kind of see that
 

2195
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,990
this takes end time kind of see that
right because like

2196
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
right because like
 

2197
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,630
right because like
at step n we call n minus one we call it

2198
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:46,640
at step n we call n minus one we call it
 

2199
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,750
at step n we call n minus one we call it
minus two

2200
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
minus two
 

2201
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,030
minus two
and so on all the way down to one

2202
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
and so on all the way down to one
 

2203
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,630
and so on all the way down to one
right if we want to improve this one of

2204
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
right if we want to improve this one of
 

2205
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,550
right if we want to improve this one of
the ways that we uh i think in theory

2206
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
the ways that we uh i think in theory
 

2207
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,670
the ways that we uh i think in theory
you guys have learned in the past and

2208
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
you guys have learned in the past and
 

2209
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,150
you guys have learned in the past and
you're gonna

2210
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,160
you're gonna
 

2211
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,950
you're gonna
cover in in recitation is a technique

2212
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:58,960
cover in in recitation is a technique
 

2213
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,390
cover in in recitation is a technique
called substitution

2214
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
called substitution
 

2215
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,910
called substitution
what we do is we're going to look at

2216
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
what we do is we're going to look at
 

2217
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,349
what we do is we're going to look at
this relationship and we're going to

2218
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:03,359
this relationship and we're going to
 

2219
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,550
this relationship and we're going to
hypothesize

2220
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
hypothesize
 

2221
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,230
hypothesize
that we think s of n maybe

2222
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,240
that we think s of n maybe
 

2223
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,630
that we think s of n maybe
looks something like c n for some

2224
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:10,640
looks something like c n for some
 

2225
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,270
looks something like c n for some
constant c

2226
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
constant c
 

2227
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,750
constant c
that doesn't depend on n then all we

2228
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
that doesn't depend on n then all we
 

2229
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,190
that doesn't depend on n then all we
have to do is double check that that

2230
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,200
have to do is double check that that
 

2231
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,870
have to do is double check that that
relationship is consistent with our

2232
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:16,880
relationship is consistent with our
 

2233
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,710
relationship is consistent with our
inductive hypothesis

2234
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
inductive hypothesis
 

2235
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,630
inductive hypothesis
or rather just this recursive function

2236
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:20,640
or rather just this recursive function
 

2237
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,790
or rather just this recursive function
and if it is then we're in good shape

2238
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
and if it is then we're in good shape
 

2239
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,150
and if it is then we're in good shape
yeah so in this case well what do i know

2240
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
yeah so in this case well what do i know
 

2241
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,390
yeah so in this case well what do i know
i

2242
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
i
 

2243
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,670
i
i've guessed that s of n

2244
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
i've guessed that s of n
 

2245
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,349
i've guessed that s of n
is theta of n so oops in particular

2246
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:33,359
is theta of n so oops in particular
 

2247
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,349
is theta of n so oops in particular
uh if i plug into this recursive

2248
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
uh if i plug into this recursive
 

2249
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,790
uh if i plug into this recursive
relationship here on the left hand side

2250
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
relationship here on the left hand side
 

2251
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,589
relationship here on the left hand side
i'm going to get cn

2252
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:39,599
i'm going to get cn
 

2253
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,510
i'm going to get cn
on the right hand side i'm going to get

2254
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,520
on the right hand side i'm going to get
 

2255
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,150
on the right hand side i'm going to get
c n minus 1

2256
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,160
c n minus 1
 

2257
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,670
c n minus 1
plus theta of 1.

2258
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:47,680
plus theta of 1.
 

2259
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,710
plus theta of 1.
we just have to make sure that this is

2260
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
we just have to make sure that this is
 

2261
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,870
we just have to make sure that this is
like an okay equal sign

2262
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
like an okay equal sign
 

2263
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,950
like an okay equal sign
so what can i do i can subtract c n from

2264
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:52,960
so what can i do i can subtract c n from
 

2265
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,069
so what can i do i can subtract c n from
both sides

2266
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:54,079
both sides
 

2267
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,510
both sides
maybe put that one on the other side

2268
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
maybe put that one on the other side
 

2269
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,349
maybe put that one on the other side
here i'm gonna get the

2270
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
here i'm gonna get the
 

2271
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,390
here i'm gonna get the
c equals big o of one c

2272
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,400
c equals big o of one c
 

2273
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,990
c equals big o of one c
is of course a constant so we're in good

2274
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,000
is of course a constant so we're in good
 

2275
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,109
is of course a constant so we're in good
shape

2276
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119

 

2277
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,950

my undergrad algorithms professor told

2278
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:06,960
my undergrad algorithms professor told
 

2279
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,870
my undergrad algorithms professor told
me never to write a victory mark at the

2280
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:08,880
me never to write a victory mark at the
 

2281
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,750
me never to write a victory mark at the
end of a proof

2282
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:09,760
end of a proof
 

2283
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,109
end of a proof
you have to like do a little square but

2284
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
you have to like do a little square but
 

2285
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,230
you have to like do a little square but
he's not here okay uh

2286
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,240
he's not here okay uh
 

2287
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,310
he's not here okay uh
right so now uh i see you but we're a

2288
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,320
right so now uh i see you but we're a
 

2289
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,750
right so now uh i see you but we're a
little low on time so we'll save it for

2290
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:19,760
little low on time so we'll save it for
 

2291
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,109
little low on time so we'll save it for
the end of lecture

2292
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
the end of lecture
 

2293
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,190
the end of lecture
um okay so if we want to implement the

2294
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,200
um okay so if we want to implement the
 

2295
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,109
um okay so if we want to implement the
selection sort algorithm

2296
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,119
selection sort algorithm
 

2297
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,510
selection sort algorithm
well what do we do well we're going to

2298
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,520
well what do we do well we're going to
 

2299
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,310
well what do we do well we're going to
think of i

2300
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
think of i
 

2301
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,230
think of i
as the index of like that that red line

2302
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
as the index of like that that red line
 

2303
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,589
as the index of like that that red line
that i was showing you before

2304
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:31,599
that i was showing you before
 

2305
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,510
that i was showing you before
right so everything beyond i is already

2306
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
right so everything beyond i is already
 

2307
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,589
right so everything beyond i is already
sorted

2308
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:35,599
sorted
 

2309
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,430
sorted
so in selection store the first thing

2310
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:37,440
so in selection store the first thing
 

2311
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,030
so in selection store the first thing
i'm going to do is find the max element

2312
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,040
i'm going to do is find the max element
 

2313
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,950
i'm going to do is find the max element
between 0 and i

2314
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:40,960
between 0 and i
 

2315
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,750
between 0 and i
and then i'm going to swap it into place

2316
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760
and then i'm going to swap it into place
 

2317
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,270
and then i'm going to swap it into place
right so this is just a code

2318
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
right so this is just a code
 

2319
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,790
right so this is just a code
version of the the technique we've

2320
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800
version of the the technique we've
 

2321
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,550
version of the the technique we've
already talked about hopefully this

2322
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
already talked about hopefully this
 

2323
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,190
already talked about hopefully this
makes sense

2324
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
makes sense
 

2325
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,349
makes sense
right so you find the biggest element

2326
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:51,359
right so you find the biggest element
 

2327
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,870
right so you find the biggest element
between zero and index i

2328
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:52,880
between zero and index i
 

2329
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,630
between zero and index i
right that's what we're going to call j

2330
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:54,640
right that's what we're going to call j
 

2331
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,030
right that's what we're going to call j
here i swap that

2332
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,040
here i swap that
 

2333
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,310
here i swap that
with the one in index i that's step two

2334
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
with the one in index i that's step two
 

2335
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,990
with the one in index i that's step two
and then step three is i still have to

2336
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,000
and then step three is i still have to
 

2337
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,670
and then step three is i still have to
sort everything to the left of index i

2338
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
sort everything to the left of index i
 

2339
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,990
sort everything to the left of index i
and that's that recursive call

2340
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
and that's that recursive call
 

2341
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,190
and that's that recursive call
okay so if i want to justify the uh

2342
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,200
okay so if i want to justify the uh
 

2343
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,990
okay so if i want to justify the uh
the runtime of this particular technique

2344
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000
the runtime of this particular technique
 

2345
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,710
the runtime of this particular technique
well now

2346
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:12,720
well now
 

2347
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,150
well now
let's call that t for time yeah

2348
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,160
let's call that t for time yeah
 

2349
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,150
let's call that t for time yeah
well what do i do well for one i call

2350
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
well what do i do well for one i call
 

2351
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,950
well what do i do well for one i call
selection sort with index i minus one

2352
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:22,960
selection sort with index i minus one
 

2353
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,870
selection sort with index i minus one
right so that incurs time that looks

2354
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:24,880
right so that incurs time that looks
 

2355
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,270
right so that incurs time that looks
like this

2356
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,280
like this
 

2357
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,109
like this
but i also call that prefix max function

2358
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,119
but i also call that prefix max function
 

2359
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,310
but i also call that prefix max function
and how much time does that take that

2360
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
and how much time does that take that
 

2361
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,270
and how much time does that take that
takes order end time yeah

2362
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
takes order end time yeah
 

2363
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,030
takes order end time yeah
so at the end of the day

2364
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,040

 

2365
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,550

i have some relationship that looks like

2366
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,560
i have some relationship that looks like
 

2367
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,030
i have some relationship that looks like
this does that make sense

2368
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
this does that make sense
 

2369
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,950
this does that make sense
so by the way notice that this order n

2370
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:44,960
so by the way notice that this order n
 

2371
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,710
so by the way notice that this order n
kind of swallowed up the like order one

2372
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:46,720
kind of swallowed up the like order one
 

2373
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,310
kind of swallowed up the like order one
computations that i had to do

2374
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,320
computations that i had to do
 

2375
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,829
computations that i had to do
like to swap and so on okay

2376
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:51,839
like to swap and so on okay
 

2377
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,270
like to swap and so on okay
so remember uh there's this nice uh

2378
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280
so remember uh there's this nice uh
 

2379
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,550
so remember uh there's this nice uh
relationship which you probably learned

2380
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,560
relationship which you probably learned
 

2381
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,390
relationship which you probably learned
in your combinatorics class

2382
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,400
in your combinatorics class
 

2383
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,310
in your combinatorics class
which is that one plus two plus dot dot

2384
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,320
which is that one plus two plus dot dot
 

2385
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,670
which is that one plus two plus dot dot
plus n

2386
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:01,680
plus n
 

2387
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,109
plus n
okay i can never remember exactly the

2388
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
okay i can never remember exactly the
 

2389
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,710
okay i can never remember exactly the
formula but i'm pretty sure that it

2390
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:04,720
formula but i'm pretty sure that it
 

2391
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,829
formula but i'm pretty sure that it
looks like n squared yeah

2392
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:07,839
looks like n squared yeah
 

2393
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,990
looks like n squared yeah
so based on that and and taking a look

2394
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,000
so based on that and and taking a look
 

2395
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,750
so based on that and and taking a look
at this uh recursive thing right which

2396
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:11,760
at this uh recursive thing right which
 

2397
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,190
at this uh recursive thing right which
is essentially doing exactly that right

2398
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,200
is essentially doing exactly that right
 

2399
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,349
is essentially doing exactly that right
n plus n minus 1 plus n minus 2 and so

2400
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
n plus n minus 1 plus n minus 2 and so
 

2401
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:15,990
n plus n minus 1 plus n minus 2 and so
on

2402
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,000
on
 

2403
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,030
on
i might hypothesize that this thing is

2404
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040
i might hypothesize that this thing is
 

2405
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,829
i might hypothesize that this thing is
really

2406
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
really
 

2407
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,190
really
order n squared so if i'm going to do

2408
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,200
order n squared so if i'm going to do
 

2409
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,030
order n squared so if i'm going to do
that then again if i want to use the

2410
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,040
that then again if i want to use the
 

2411
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,390
that then again if i want to use the
same technique for proof

2412
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
same technique for proof
 

2413
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,710
same technique for proof
i have to plug this relationship in and

2414
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,720
i have to plug this relationship in and
 

2415
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,230
i have to plug this relationship in and
then double check that it's consistent

2416
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
then double check that it's consistent
 

2417
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,790
then double check that it's consistent
right so uh maybe i hypothesize that t

2418
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:32,800
right so uh maybe i hypothesize that t
 

2419
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,790
right so uh maybe i hypothesize that t
of n

2420
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
of n
 

2421
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,390
of n
equals c n squared in which case i plug

2422
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,400
equals c n squared in which case i plug
 

2423
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,349
equals c n squared in which case i plug
it in here

2424
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359

 

2425
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,829

i have c n squared equals with a

2426
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
i have c n squared equals with a
 

2427
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,430
i have c n squared equals with a
question mark over it

2428
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,440
question mark over it
 

2429
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,109
question mark over it
c n minus 1 squared plus

2430
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:49,119
c n minus 1 squared plus
 

2431
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,790
c n minus 1 squared plus
big o or even theta of n here

2432
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:52,800
big o or even theta of n here
 

2433
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,470
big o or even theta of n here
so if i expand the square notice i'm

2434
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:54,480
so if i expand the square notice i'm
 

2435
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,950
so if i expand the square notice i'm
going to get c times n squared

2436
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960
going to get c times n squared
 

2437
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,430
going to get c times n squared
plus a bunch of linear stuff right so

2438
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
plus a bunch of linear stuff right so
 

2439
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,950
plus a bunch of linear stuff right so
this is really

2440
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:00,960
this is really
 

2441
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,990
this is really
c n squared uh

2442
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
c n squared uh
 

2443
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,190
c n squared uh
i should be careful with it uh minus 2

2444
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
i should be careful with it uh minus 2
 

2445
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,470
i should be careful with it uh minus 2
c n plus c plus

2446
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
c n plus c plus
 

2447
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,550
c n plus c plus
theta of n yeah

2448
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
theta of n yeah
 

2449
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,309
theta of n yeah
notice that there's a c n squared on

2450
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:16,319
notice that there's a c n squared on
 

2451
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,390
notice that there's a c n squared on
both sides of this equation

2452
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
both sides of this equation
 

2453
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,270
both sides of this equation
they go away and what i'm left with is a

2454
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,280
they go away and what i'm left with is a
 

2455
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,390
they go away and what i'm left with is a
nice consistent

2456
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
nice consistent
 

2457
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,550
nice consistent
uh formula right that theta of n

2458
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560

 

2459
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,069

equals 2 c n plus

2460
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
equals 2 c n plus
 

2461
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,349
equals 2 c n plus
oops minus c and indeed this is an order

2462
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
oops minus c and indeed this is an order
 

2463
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,150
oops minus c and indeed this is an order
n expression

2464
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,160
n expression
 

2465
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,750
n expression
so there's order in the universe life is

2466
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:35,760
so there's order in the universe life is
 

2467
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,430
so there's order in the universe life is
good yeah this is the substitution

2468
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,440
good yeah this is the substitution
 

2469
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,069
good yeah this is the substitution
method and

2470
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,079
method and
 

2471
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,190
method and
again i think you'll cover it more in

2472
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
again i think you'll cover it more in
 

2473
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,910
again i think you'll cover it more in
your recitation so what have we done we

2474
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
your recitation so what have we done we
 

2475
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,670
your recitation so what have we done we
have derived the selection sort

2476
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
have derived the selection sort
 

2477
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,349
have derived the selection sort
we've checked that it runs an n squared

2478
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359
we've checked that it runs an n squared
 

2479
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,710
we've checked that it runs an n squared
time uh

2480
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:46,720
time uh
 

2481
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,190
time uh
and uh uh by sort of this nice inductive

2482
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
and uh uh by sort of this nice inductive
 

2483
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,069
and uh uh by sort of this nice inductive
strategy we know that it's correct so

2484
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
strategy we know that it's correct so
 

2485
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,109
strategy we know that it's correct so
life is pretty good

2486
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:53,119
life is pretty good
 

2487
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,550
life is pretty good
unfortunately i promise for you guys on

2488
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,560
unfortunately i promise for you guys on

insertion sort also runs an end time

2502
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,200
insertion sort also runs an end time
 

2503
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,589
insertion sort also runs an end time
uh okay uh where essentially insertion

2504
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:11,599
uh okay uh where essentially insertion
 

2505
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,870
uh okay uh where essentially insertion
sort kind of runs in the reverse order

2506
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:12,880
sort kind of runs in the reverse order
 

2507
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,910
sort kind of runs in the reverse order
right i'm going to sort everything to

2508
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:13,920
right i'm going to sort everything to
 

2509
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,630
right i'm going to sort everything to
the left

2510
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
the left
 

2511
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,950
the left
and then insert a new object whereas in

2512
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:16,960
and then insert a new object whereas in
 

2513
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,069
and then insert a new object whereas in
selection sort i'm going to choose the

2514
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:18,079
selection sort i'm going to choose the
 

2515
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,430
selection sort i'm going to choose the
biggest object and then sort everything

2516
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:19,440
biggest object and then sort everything
 

2517
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,710
biggest object and then sort everything
to the left

2518
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
to the left
 

2519
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,910
to the left
but i'll let you guys piece through that

2520
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:21,920
but i'll let you guys piece through that
 

2521
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,510
but i'll let you guys piece through that
at home it's essentially the same

2522
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
at home it's essentially the same
 

2523
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,550
at home it's essentially the same
argument

2524
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:24,560
argument
 

2525
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,870
argument
and instead we should jump to an

2526
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:26,880
and instead we should jump to an
 

2527
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,109
and instead we should jump to an
algorithm that actually uh matters

2528
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:29,119
algorithm that actually uh matters
 

2529
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,190
algorithm that actually uh matters
which is uh something called merge story

2530
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,200
which is uh something called merge story
 

2531
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,829
which is uh something called merge story
that means i've encountered merge sort

2532
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:32,839
that means i've encountered merge sort
 

2533
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,230
that means i've encountered merge sort
before

2534
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
before
 

2535
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,190

fabulous good so then i'm done uh no

2536
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,200
fabulous good so then i'm done uh no
 

2537
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,790
fabulous good so then i'm done uh no
okay so so let's say that i have

2538
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:38,800
okay so so let's say that i have
 

2539
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,550
okay so so let's say that i have
a list now i'm sending a message back to

2540
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,560
a list now i'm sending a message back to
 

2541
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,230
a list now i'm sending a message back to
jason i made this one up last night

2542
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,240
jason i made this one up last night
 

2543
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,069
jason i made this one up last night
uh so i have seven one five six two four

2544
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:44,079
uh so i have seven one five six two four
 

2545
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,670
uh so i have seven one five six two four
nine three

2546
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:45,680
nine three
 

2547
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,550
nine three
this is not in sorted order but i can

2548
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
this is not in sorted order but i can
 

2549
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,150
this is not in sorted order but i can
make a very deep observation which is

2550
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,160
make a very deep observation which is
 

2551
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,230
make a very deep observation which is
that every number by itself is in sorted

2552
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
that every number by itself is in sorted
 

2553
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,750
that every number by itself is in sorted
order if i think of it as an array of

2554
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
order if i think of it as an array of
 

2555
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,670
order if i think of it as an array of
length one

2556
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
length one
 

2557
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,790
length one
yeah this is really deep like a deep

2558
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
yeah this is really deep like a deep
 

2559
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,230
yeah this is really deep like a deep
learning deep

2560
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240
learning deep
 

2561
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,390
learning deep
okay so now what can i do well i could

2562
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
okay so now what can i do well i could
 

2563
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,150
okay so now what can i do well i could
take every pair of numbers

2564
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160
take every pair of numbers
 

2565
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,790
take every pair of numbers
draw a little red box well now they're

2566
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:06,800
draw a little red box well now they're
 

2567
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,230
draw a little red box well now they're
not in sorted order anymore inside of

2568
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:08,240
not in sorted order anymore inside of
 

2569
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,910
not in sorted order anymore inside of
the red boxes so i'm going to sort

2570
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:09,920
the red boxes so i'm going to sort
 

2571
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,990
the red boxes so i'm going to sort
inside of every box in this case not too

2572
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,000
inside of every box in this case not too
 

2573
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,470
inside of every box in this case not too
exciting because it's just pairs

2574
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,480
exciting because it's just pairs
 

2575
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,670
exciting because it's just pairs
and now they're in sorted order because

2576
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
and now they're in sorted order because
 

2577
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,069
and now they're in sorted order because
i said they were now i'm going to keep

2578
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:18,079
i said they were now i'm going to keep
 

2579
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,910
i said they were now i'm going to keep
doubling the size of my boxes so now

2580
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:19,920
doubling the size of my boxes so now
 

2581
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,470
doubling the size of my boxes so now
let's say i have box of length four

2582
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480
let's say i have box of length four
 

2583
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,390
let's say i have box of length four
what do i know about the left and right

2584
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,400
what do i know about the left and right
 

2585
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,150
what do i know about the left and right
hand sides of the dotted lines here

2586
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
hand sides of the dotted lines here
 

2587
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,790
hand sides of the dotted lines here
on the two sides of the dotted lines the

2588
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:30,800
on the two sides of the dotted lines the
 

2589
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,470
on the two sides of the dotted lines the
array is in sorted order right there's a

2590
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:32,480
array is in sorted order right there's a
 

2591
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,589
array is in sorted order right there's a
one and then a seven

2592
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:33,599
one and then a seven
 

2593
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,030
one and then a seven
right those are in sorted order five and

2594
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
right those are in sorted order five and
 

2595
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,710
right those are in sorted order five and
a six that's because in the previous

2596
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:36,720
a six that's because in the previous
 

2597
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,589
a six that's because in the previous
step i sorted every pair

2598
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:39,599
step i sorted every pair
 

2599
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,430
step i sorted every pair
so when i merge these two sides together

2600
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:43,440
so when i merge these two sides together
 

2601
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,270
so when i merge these two sides together
i have an additional useful piece of

2602
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
i have an additional useful piece of
 

2603
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,630
i have an additional useful piece of
information right

2604
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:46,640
information right
 

2605
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,030
information right
namely that the two sides of the dotted

2606
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,040
namely that the two sides of the dotted
 

2607
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,710
namely that the two sides of the dotted
line are already in sorted order that's

2608
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
line are already in sorted order that's
 

2609
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,069
line are already in sorted order that's
going to be our basic sort of inductive

2610
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
going to be our basic sort of inductive
 

2611
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,270
going to be our basic sort of inductive
step here

2612
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
step here
 

2613
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,990
step here
yeah so in this case i merge the two

2614
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000
yeah so in this case i merge the two
 

2615
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,790
yeah so in this case i merge the two
sides i get

2616
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:56,800
sides i get
 

2617
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,390
sides i get
one five six seven and two three four

2618
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
one five six seven and two three four
 

2619
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,390
one five six seven and two three four
nine then finally i put these two things

2620
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
nine then finally i put these two things
 

2621
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,109
nine then finally i put these two things
together

2622
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
together
 

2623
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,750
together
and i have to sort these two uh uh i

2624
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:03,760
and i have to sort these two uh uh i
 

2625
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,230
and i have to sort these two uh uh i
have to merge these two sorted lists

2626
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
have to merge these two sorted lists
 

2627
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,150
have to merge these two sorted lists
but they're in sorted order yeah and

2628
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,160
but they're in sorted order yeah and
 

2629
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,990
but they're in sorted order yeah and
that's going to give me a big advantage

2630
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
that's going to give me a big advantage
 

2631
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,109
that's going to give me a big advantage
right because uh oops i lost my truck

2632
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119

 

2633
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,630

i suppose i've got space on this board

2634
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:16,640
i suppose i've got space on this board
 

2635
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,710
i suppose i've got space on this board
here

2636
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:18,720
here
 

2637
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,390
here
oh no uh right so if i want to

2638
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,400
oh no uh right so if i want to
 

2639
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,990
oh no uh right so if i want to
merge one five six seven

2640
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,000
merge one five six seven
 

2641
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,670
merge one five six seven
and two three four nine

2642
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680
and two three four nine
 

2643
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,030
and two three four nine
there's like a nice clever technique

2644
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,040
there's like a nice clever technique
 

2645
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,870
there's like a nice clever technique
that we can do uh that's going to take

2646
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
that we can do uh that's going to take
 

2647
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,150
that we can do uh that's going to take
just linear time

2648
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,160
just linear time
 

2649
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,510
just linear time
jason tells me it's the two-finger

2650
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:35,520
jason tells me it's the two-finger
 

2651
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,710
jason tells me it's the two-finger
algorithm i think that's kind of a cute

2652
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
algorithm i think that's kind of a cute
 

2653
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,670
algorithm i think that's kind of a cute
analogy here

2654
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
analogy here
 

2655
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,870
analogy here
so here are my two fingers they're going

2656
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880
so here are my two fingers they're going
 

2657
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,710
so here are my two fingers they're going
to point at the end of the list

2658
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:40,720
to point at the end of the list
 

2659
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,309
to point at the end of the list
and i'm going to construct the merged

2660
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:42,319
and i'm going to construct the merged
 

2661
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,069
and i'm going to construct the merged
array backwards

2662
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
array backwards
 

2663
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,910
array backwards
so how many elements are in my merged

2664
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920
so how many elements are in my merged
 

2665
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,270
so how many elements are in my merged
array if i'm merging two things of

2666
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280
array if i'm merging two things of
 

2667
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,270
array if i'm merging two things of
length four

2668
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:49,280
length four
 

2669
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,069
length four
i don't ask you guys hard questions it's

2670
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
i don't ask you guys hard questions it's
 

2671
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:52,470
i don't ask you guys hard questions it's
eight

2672
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:52,480
eight
 

2673
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,829
eight
yeah two four plus four eight yeah okay

2674
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:55,839
yeah two four plus four eight yeah okay
 

2675
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,510
yeah two four plus four eight yeah okay
so what do i know i know that my merge

2676
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:57,520
so what do i know i know that my merge
 

2677
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,270
so what do i know i know that my merge
array

2678
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
array
 

2679
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,950
array
ah five six seven has eight

2680
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:02,960
ah five six seven has eight
 

2681
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,190
ah five six seven has eight
elements and now i'm gonna have two

2682
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
elements and now i'm gonna have two
 

2683
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,670
elements and now i'm gonna have two
fingers at the end of my array

2684
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680
fingers at the end of my array
 

2685
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,670
fingers at the end of my array
which one should i put at the end of the

2686
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:09,680
which one should i put at the end of the
 

2687
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,349
which one should i put at the end of the
merged guy

2688
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:11,359
merged guy
 

2689
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,670
merged guy
the seven or the nine

2690
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680

 

2691
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,950

the nine right thank you right

2692
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
the nine right thank you right
 

2693
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,150
the nine right thank you right
so now i can move my lower finger to the

2694
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,160
so now i can move my lower finger to the
 

2695
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,349
so now i can move my lower finger to the
left

2696
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
left
 

2697
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,950
left
right because i've already added that

2698
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
right because i've already added that
 

2699
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,309
right because i've already added that
notice that i never need to look to the

2700
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:26,319
notice that i never need to look to the
 

2701
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,829
notice that i never need to look to the
left of where my finger is because

2702
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:27,839
left of where my finger is because
 

2703
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,030
left of where my finger is because
they're already in sorted order

2704
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040
they're already in sorted order
 

2705
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,109
they're already in sorted order
right now what should i add the four the

2706
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
right now what should i add the four the
 

2707
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,630
right now what should i add the four the
seven

2708
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,640
seven
 

2709
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,069
seven
the seven and so on dot dot

2710
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:36,079
the seven and so on dot dot
 

2711
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,030
the seven and so on dot dot
dot yeah so that's going to be the basic

2712
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,040
dot yeah so that's going to be the basic
 

2713
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,470
dot yeah so that's going to be the basic
idea of the merge sort i'm going to take

2714
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:40,480
idea of the merge sort i'm going to take
 

2715
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,750
idea of the merge sort i'm going to take
two sorted lists

2716
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,760
two sorted lists
 

2717
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,109
two sorted lists
i'm going to make a new sorted list

2718
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
i'm going to make a new sorted list
 

2719
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,270
i'm going to make a new sorted list
which is twice as long by using two

2720
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
which is twice as long by using two
 

2721
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,390
which is twice as long by using two
fingers

2722
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:46,400
fingers
 

2723
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,510
fingers
moving uh from the end backward okay so

2724
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:49,520
moving uh from the end backward okay so
 

2725
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,589
moving uh from the end backward okay so
that's the basic intuition here

2726
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
that's the basic intuition here
 

2727
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,829
that's the basic intuition here
indeed there's our sorted list stressing

2728
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:53,839
indeed there's our sorted list stressing
 

2729
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,270
indeed there's our sorted list stressing
me out that there's no eight but

2730
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,280
me out that there's no eight but
 

2731
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,390
me out that there's no eight but
i needed a power of two um

2732
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
i needed a power of two um
 

2733
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,390
i needed a power of two um
so i think the merge sort we're gonna

2734
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
so i think the merge sort we're gonna
 

2735
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,910
so i think the merge sort we're gonna
present in kind of a backward way from

2736
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:01,920
present in kind of a backward way from
 

2737
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,190
present in kind of a backward way from
the previous one where i'm gonna give

2738
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:03,200
the previous one where i'm gonna give
 

2739
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,470
the previous one where i'm gonna give
you the high level algorithm

2740
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,480
you the high level algorithm
 

2741
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,670
you the high level algorithm
and then actually the headache is that

2742
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
and then actually the headache is that
 

2743
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,270
and then actually the headache is that
merging step which i have four minutes

2744
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,280
merging step which i have four minutes
 

2745
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,750
merging step which i have four minutes
for and i apologize for

2746
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:09,760
for and i apologize for
 

2747
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,510
for and i apologize for
so what does the merge sort do well it

2748
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
so what does the merge sort do well it
 

2749
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,870
so what does the merge sort do well it
computes an index c

2750
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:12,880
computes an index c
 

2751
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,510
computes an index c
which is the middle of my array and it's

2752
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,520
which is the middle of my array and it's
 

2753
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,710
which is the middle of my array and it's
going to make a recursive call which

2754
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:16,720
going to make a recursive call which
 

2755
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,470
going to make a recursive call which
says sort the left right which is

2756
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
says sort the left right which is
 

2757
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,710
says sort the left right which is
everything between index a and index c

2758
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:22,720
everything between index a and index c
 

2759
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,069
everything between index a and index c
and then sort everything on the right

2760
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079
and then sort everything on the right
 

2761
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,910
and then sort everything on the right
which is everything from index c

2762
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
which is everything from index c
 

2763
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,470
which is everything from index c
to index b i know this is confusing

2764
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:28,480
to index b i know this is confusing
 

2765
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,710
to index b i know this is confusing
because usually letters appear in order

2766
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
because usually letters appear in order
 

2767
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,870
because usually letters appear in order
but c if you think of as standing for

2768
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:32,880
but c if you think of as standing for
 

2769
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,470
but c if you think of as standing for
center then it kind of makes sense like

2770
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:34,480
center then it kind of makes sense like
 

2771
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,230
center then it kind of makes sense like
here's my array

2772
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:38,240

 

2773
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,750

i'm going to like choose an index right

2774
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:39,760
i'm going to like choose an index right
 

2775
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,990
i'm going to like choose an index right
in the middle i've done myself a

2776
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,000
in the middle i've done myself a
 

2777
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,829
in the middle i've done myself a
disservice by not using a power of

2778
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:43,839
disservice by not using a power of
 

2779
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,870
disservice by not using a power of
two but that's okay i'm gonna say

2780
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:46,880
two but that's okay i'm gonna say
 

2781
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,150
two but that's okay i'm gonna say
sort everything to the left of the

2782
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,160
sort everything to the left of the
 

2783
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,230
sort everything to the left of the
dotted line first sort everything to the

2784
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,240
dotted line first sort everything to the
 

2785
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,069
dotted line first sort everything to the
right of the dotted line second

2786
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:52,079
right of the dotted line second
 

2787
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,790
right of the dotted line second
now i have two sorted lists on the two

2788
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:54,800
now i have two sorted lists on the two
 

2789
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,829
now i have two sorted lists on the two
sides of the dotted line

2790
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:55,839
sides of the dotted line
 

2791
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,109
sides of the dotted line
and then i'm gonna use my two fingers to

2792
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:57,119
and then i'm gonna use my two fingers to
 

2793
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,109
and then i'm gonna use my two fingers to
put them together

2794
00:45:59,109 --> 00:45:59,119
put them together
 

2795
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,710
put them together
okay so that's what this is implementing

2796
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
okay so that's what this is implementing
 

2797
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,950
okay so that's what this is implementing
here see there's two recursive calls

2798
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:02,960
here see there's two recursive calls
 

2799
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,870
here see there's two recursive calls
sort from a to c and then sort from c to

2800
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880
sort from a to c and then sort from c to
 

2801
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,309
sort from a to c and then sort from c to
b oops i didn't actually label this

2802
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
b oops i didn't actually label this
 

2803
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,390
b oops i didn't actually label this
so this is a c b

2804
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,400
so this is a c b
 

2805
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,589
so this is a c b
and then i gotta call merge

2806
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:13,599
and then i gotta call merge
 

2807
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,790
and then i gotta call merge
okay now our implementation of merge

2808
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:18,800
okay now our implementation of merge
 

2809
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,950
okay now our implementation of merge
well we can also do this in a recursive

2810
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:20,960
well we can also do this in a recursive
 

2811
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,829
well we can also do this in a recursive
fashion but i

2812
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:21,839
fashion but i
 

2813
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:22,870
fashion but i
personally find this a little

2814
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
personally find this a little
 

2815
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,790
personally find this a little
complicated i'm going to admit but

2816
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:24,800
complicated i'm going to admit but
 

2817
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,829
complicated i'm going to admit but
here's the basic

2818
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:25,839
here's the basic
 

2819
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,670
here's the basic
idea here which i'm now rushing

2820
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,680

 

2821
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,069

so i'm going to think of my upper finger

2822
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:34,079
so i'm going to think of my upper finger
 

2823
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,670
so i'm going to think of my upper finger
as finger i

2824
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:35,680
as finger i
 

2825
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,390
as finger i
in my lower finger as finger jack does

2826
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,400
in my lower finger as finger jack does
 

2827
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,829
in my lower finger as finger jack does
that make sense

2828
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:39,839
that make sense
 

2829
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,750
that make sense
okay so i have two sorted lists

2830
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
okay so i have two sorted lists
 

2831
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,030
okay so i have two sorted lists
so maybe like that i don't know one

2832
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
so maybe like that i don't know one
 

2833
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,829
so maybe like that i don't know one
three five seven and then i have a

2834
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:49,839
three five seven and then i have a
 

2835
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,589
three five seven and then i have a
second sorted list

2836
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
second sorted list
 

2837
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,750
second sorted list
here which is maybe two four

2838
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:55,760
here which is maybe two four
 

2839
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,790
here which is maybe two four
72 as one does

2840
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
72 as one does
 

2841
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,230
72 as one does
then i'm going to have one pointer like

2842
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
then i'm going to have one pointer like
 

2843
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,829
then i'm going to have one pointer like
this which is

2844
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:01,839
this which is
 

2845
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,870
this which is
i and a pointer down here

2846
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:04,880
i and a pointer down here
 

2847
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,910
i and a pointer down here
which is j right and my goal is to

2848
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:07,920
which is j right and my goal is to
 

2849
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,190
which is j right and my goal is to
construct

2850
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
construct
 

2851
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,589
construct
an array a

2852
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599

 

2853
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,910

with a bunch of elements in it and the

2854
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:15,920
with a bunch of elements in it and the
 

2855
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,750
with a bunch of elements in it and the
way that i'm going to do it

2856
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,760
way that i'm going to do it
 

2857
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,589
way that i'm going to do it
is i'm going to use exactly the same

2858
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:19,599
is i'm going to use exactly the same
 

2859
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,589
is i'm going to use exactly the same
kind of recursive argument right that i

2860
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:21,599
kind of recursive argument right that i
 

2861
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,109
kind of recursive argument right that i
can either

2862
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:23,119
can either
 

2863
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,950
can either
have the biggest element of my array be

2864
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
have the biggest element of my array be
 

2865
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,950
have the biggest element of my array be
the last element of the first guy

2866
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:26,960
the last element of the first guy
 

2867
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,990
the last element of the first guy
or be the last element of the second one

2868
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,000
or be the last element of the second one
 

2869
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,829
or be the last element of the second one
yeah so here's our going to be our

2870
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:31,839
yeah so here's our going to be our
 

2871
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,109
yeah so here's our going to be our
recursive call

2872
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
recursive call
 

2873
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,710
recursive call
and in addition to that for convenience

2874
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:34,720
and in addition to that for convenience
 

2875
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,470
and in addition to that for convenience
we'll have a third index

2876
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
we'll have a third index
 

2877
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,190
we'll have a third index
which is b which is pointing to the sort

2878
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,200
which is b which is pointing to the sort
 

2879
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,589
which is b which is pointing to the sort
of thing inside of my my assorted array

2880
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,599
of thing inside of my my assorted array
 

2881
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,670
of thing inside of my my assorted array
that i'm currently processing yeah just

2882
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:43,680
that i'm currently processing yeah just
 

2883
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,030
that i'm currently processing yeah just
gonna start it a

2884
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,040
gonna start it a
 

2885
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,270
gonna start it a
go to b yeah instantly i see a lot of

2886
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
go to b yeah instantly i see a lot of
 

2887
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,630
go to b yeah instantly i see a lot of
people taking photos of the slides uh

2888
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:48,640
people taking photos of the slides uh
 

2889
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,910
people taking photos of the slides uh
these are just copy pasted from the

2890
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
these are just copy pasted from the
 

2891
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,270
these are just copy pasted from the
course notes

2892
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,280
course notes
 

2893
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,829
course notes
um okay so in this case what should i

2894
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
um okay so in this case what should i
 

2895
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,950
um okay so in this case what should i
put in b

2896
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960

 

2897
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,549

for my two arrays i have one three five

2898
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
for my two arrays i have one three five
 

2899
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,190
for my two arrays i have one three five
seven two four six seventy two

2900
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200
seven two four six seventy two
 

2901
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,109
seven two four six seventy two
seventy two yeah

2902
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119

 

2903
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,030

great so now what am i going to do i'm

2904
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:07,040
great so now what am i going to do i'm
 

2905
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,069
great so now what am i going to do i'm
just going to call the merge function

2906
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:10,079
just going to call the merge function
 

2907
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,270
just going to call the merge function
but i'm going to decrement b

2908
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:13,280
but i'm going to decrement b
 

2909
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,950
but i'm going to decrement b
because now i'm happy with that last

2910
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:14,960
because now i'm happy with that last
 

2911
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,190
because now i'm happy with that last
element in addition to that

2912
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:17,200
element in addition to that
 

2913
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,750
element in addition to that
i'm going to decrement j because i

2914
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:19,760
i'm going to decrement j because i
 

2915
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,549
i'm going to decrement j because i
already used it up

2916
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:22,559

 

2917
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,470

and so that's our recursive call here

2918
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:24,480
and so that's our recursive call here
 

2919
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,670
and so that's our recursive call here
right it's saying

2920
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
right it's saying
 

2921
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,030
right it's saying
if j is launching equal to zero so in

2922
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
if j is launching equal to zero so in
 

2923
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,190
if j is launching equal to zero so in
other words i have an element to use

2924
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
other words i have an element to use
 

2925
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,390
other words i have an element to use
in in one of the list or the other and

2926
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:32,400
in in one of the list or the other and
 

2927
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,309
in in one of the list or the other and
uh that maybe the left one is bigger

2928
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
uh that maybe the left one is bigger
 

2929
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,910
uh that maybe the left one is bigger
than the right one

2930
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:35,920
than the right one
 

2931
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,349
than the right one
right that's our first case that does

2932
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:37,359
right that's our first case that does
 

2933
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,510
right that's our first case that does
not apply in this example here

2934
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:39,520
not apply in this example here
 

2935
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,270
not apply in this example here
well then i should make the last element

2936
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
well then i should make the last element
 

2937
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,950
well then i should make the last element
of a from the first list and then

2938
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:42,960
of a from the first list and then
 

2939
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,990
of a from the first list and then
recurse

2940
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
recurse
 

2941
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,109
recurse
um with one fewer element i

2942
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:47,119
um with one fewer element i
 

2943
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,150
um with one fewer element i
and similarly the reverse case for j

2944
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
and similarly the reverse case for j
 

2945
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,950
and similarly the reverse case for j
okay so if we do our run time in two

2946
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:52,960
okay so if we do our run time in two
 

2947
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,950
okay so if we do our run time in two
minutes or less bear with me guys

2948
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
minutes or less bear with me guys
 

2949
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,750
minutes or less bear with me guys
uh well what is this merge function

2950
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
uh well what is this merge function
 

2951
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,510
uh well what is this merge function
going to do

2952
00:48:59,510 --> 00:48:59,520
going to do
 

2953
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,390
going to do
well in some sense there's two branches

2954
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
well in some sense there's two branches
 

2955
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,589
well in some sense there's two branches
right there's an if statement with two

2956
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:03,599
right there's an if statement with two
 

2957
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,230
right there's an if statement with two
pieces

2958
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,240
pieces
 

2959
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,349
pieces
but both of those pieces call merge with

2960
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
but both of those pieces call merge with
 

2961
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,069
but both of those pieces call merge with
one fewer

2962
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:08,079
one fewer
 

2963
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,510
one fewer
uh piece in it right so in some sense we

2964
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:11,520
uh piece in it right so in some sense we
 

2965
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,069
uh piece in it right so in some sense we
have

2966
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:12,079
have
 

2967
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,349
have
s of n equals s n minus 1

2968
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:15,359
s of n equals s n minus 1
 

2969
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,950
s of n equals s n minus 1
plus theta of 1 which we already know

2970
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
plus theta of 1 which we already know
 

2971
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,470
plus theta of 1 which we already know
from our previous proof means that s of

2972
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:22,480
from our previous proof means that s of
 

2973
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,670
from our previous proof means that s of
n is equal to theta of n

2974
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,680
n is equal to theta of n
 

2975
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,510
n is equal to theta of n
so in other words it takes linear time

2976
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:29,520
so in other words it takes linear time
 

2977
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,710
so in other words it takes linear time
to merge

2978
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
to merge
 

2979
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,150
to merge
it kind of makes sense intuitively right

2980
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,160
it kind of makes sense intuitively right
 

2981
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,430
it kind of makes sense intuitively right
because essentially you're touching

2982
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:33,440
because essentially you're touching
 

2983
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,349
because essentially you're touching
every one of these things once

2984
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:35,359
every one of these things once
 

2985
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,390
every one of these things once
with your two fingers

2986
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,400

 

2987
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,549

and now our probably the hardest part of

2988
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
and now our probably the hardest part of
 

2989
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,630
and now our probably the hardest part of
the lecture which i left zero time for

2990
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:42,640
the lecture which i left zero time for
 

2991
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,870
the lecture which i left zero time for
is deriving the run time for the actual

2994
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
merge sort algorithm
 

2995
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,870
merge sort algorithm
and what does that look like well that

2996
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:48,880
and what does that look like well that
 

2997
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,230
and what does that look like well that
one's a little bit trickier

2998
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,240
one's a little bit trickier
 

2999
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,510
one's a little bit trickier
right because of course i call the merge

3000
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:53,520
right because of course i call the merge
 

3001
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,710
right because of course i call the merge

in this class we're going to assume that

3008
00:49:59,829 --> 00:49:59,839
in this class we're going to assume that
 

3009
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,510
in this class we're going to assume that
our list is always the power of two in

3010
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,520
our list is always the power of two in
 

3011
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,309
our list is always the power of two in
its length

3012
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
its length
 

3013
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,589
its length
otherwise this analysis is a itty-bitty

3014
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:05,599
otherwise this analysis is a itty-bitty
 

3015
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,549
otherwise this analysis is a itty-bitty
bit more of a headache so first of all

3016
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559
bit more of a headache so first of all
 

3017
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,829
bit more of a headache so first of all
how long does it take to sort an array

3018
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:09,839
how long does it take to sort an array
 

3019
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,670
how long does it take to sort an array

i legit i'm not going to ask hard

3022
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:13,200
i legit i'm not going to ask hard
 

3023
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,630
i legit i'm not going to ask hard
questions everybody

3024
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
questions everybody
 

3025
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,190
questions everybody
yeah just just like one right because

3026
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
yeah just just like one right because
 

3027
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,950
yeah just just like one right because
like there's nothing to do my

3028
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:20,960
like there's nothing to do my
 

3029
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,710
like there's nothing to do my
array of length one has has one element

3030
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:22,720
array of length one has has one element
 

3031
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,069
array of length one has has one element
and it's sorted it's also

3032
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:24,079
and it's sorted it's also
 

3033
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,750
and it's sorted it's also
you know the biggest element and the

3034
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760
you know the biggest element and the
 

3035
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,430
you know the biggest element and the
smallest element

3036
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:27,440
smallest element
 

3037
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,950
smallest element
okay and now what does our algorithm do

3038
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:30,960
okay and now what does our algorithm do
 

3039
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,349
okay and now what does our algorithm do
well it makes two recursive calls on

3040
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
well it makes two recursive calls on
 

3041
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:39,109
well it makes two recursive calls on
lists that are half the length

3042
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:39,119

 

3043
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,270

yeah and then it calls that merge

3044
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,280
yeah and then it calls that merge
 

3045
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,630
yeah and then it calls that merge
function and we know

3046
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
function and we know
 

3047
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,710
function and we know
that the merge function takes theta of n

3048
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:44,720
that the merge function takes theta of n
 

3049
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,109
that the merge function takes theta of n
time

3050
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119

 

3051
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,630

that makes sense so

3052
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:50,640
that makes sense so
 

3053
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,230
that makes sense so
uh one thing we might do because we have

3054
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
uh one thing we might do because we have
 

3055
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,069
uh one thing we might do because we have
some intuition from your

3056
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
some intuition from your
 

3057
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,790
some intuition from your
your 6042 course is that we think

3058
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:58,800
your 6042 course is that we think
 

3059
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,710
your 6042 course is that we think
that this thing is order

3060
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,720
that this thing is order
 

3061
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,790
that this thing is order
n log n right because it makes that two

3062
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:06,800
n log n right because it makes that two
 

3063
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,309
n log n right because it makes that two
recursive calls and then it puts them

3064
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
recursive calls and then it puts them
 

3065
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:08,870
recursive calls and then it puts them
together

3066
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:08,880
together
 

3067
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,150
together
and let's double check that that's true

3068
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:10,160
and let's double check that that's true
 

3069
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,589
and let's double check that that's true
really quick using the substitution

00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:44,240
class that you probably forgot
 

3097
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,230
class that you probably forgot
remember that log of two things divided

3098
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:46,240
remember that log of two things divided
 

3099
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,270
remember that log of two things divided
by each other is the difference of the

3100
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
by each other is the difference of the
 

3101
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,309
by each other is the difference of the
logs

3102
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:48,319
logs
 

3103
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,349
logs
right so this is really two uh okay two

3104
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:51,359
right so this is really two uh okay two
 

3105
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,230
right so this is really two uh okay two
divided by two

3106
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:52,240
divided by two
 

3107
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,349
divided by two
is one so this is uh c

3108
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
is one so this is uh c
 

3109
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,790
is one so this is uh c

yeah plus theta of n
i'm already out of time but notice that

3116
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:08,319
i'm already out of time but notice that
 

3117
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,349
i'm already out of time but notice that
there's a c

3118
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
there's a c
 

3119
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,470
there's a c
n log n on the right hand side there's a

3120
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
n log n on the right hand side there's a
 

3121
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:12,790

00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,440
n log n on the left-hand side so those
 

3125
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,150
n log n on the left-hand side so those
two things

3126
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,160
two things
 

3127
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,630
two things
go away and what am i going to be left

3128
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:18,640
go away and what am i going to be left
 

3129
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,190
go away and what am i going to be left
with

3130
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:19,200
with
 

3131
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,710
with
i'm going to be left with theta of n

3132
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
i'm going to be left with theta of n
 

3133
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,910
i'm going to be left with theta of n
equals c

3134
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:25,920
equals c
 

3135
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,510
equals c
n log of 2.

3136
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,520
n log of 2.
 

3137
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,190
n log of 2.
notice that c and log 2 are both

3138
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
notice that c and log 2 are both
 

3139
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,510
notice that c and log 2 are both
constants we have a theta of n on the

3140
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,520
constants we have a theta of n on the
 

3141
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,870
constants we have a theta of n on the
left-hand side so there's order on the

3142
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
left-hand side so there's order on the
 

3143
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,790
left-hand side so there's order on the
universe and and we've derived our

3144
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:36,800
universe and and we've derived our
 

3145
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,990
universe and and we've derived our
runtime

3146
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,000
runtime
 

3147
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,510
runtime
so i know i rushed a little bit through

3148
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,520
so i know i rushed a little bit through
 

3149
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,270
so i know i rushed a little bit through
merge sort i'm sure that eric and and

3150
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:41,280
merge sort i'm sure that eric and and
 

3151
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,790
merge sort i'm sure that eric and and
jason can can review this a little bit

3152
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
jason can can review this a little bit
 

3153
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,589
jason can can review this a little bit
next time

3154
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
next time
 

3155
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,790
next time
uh but with that we'll see you uh what

3156
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
uh but with that we'll see you uh what
 

3157
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,549
uh but with that we'll see you uh what
thursday and friday and it's been a

3158
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:48,559
thursday and friday and it's been a
 

3159
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:57,359
thursday and friday and it's been a
pleasure to talk to you all
