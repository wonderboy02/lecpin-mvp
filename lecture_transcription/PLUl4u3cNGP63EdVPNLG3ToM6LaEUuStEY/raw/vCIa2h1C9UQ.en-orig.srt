material

22
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
material
 

23
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,389
material
will be fair game for this uh

24
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
will be fair game for this uh
 

25
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,950
will be fair game for this uh
this quiz but it's not something that's

26
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
this quiz but it's not something that's
 

27
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,510
this quiz but it's not something that's
gonna be

28
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
gonna be
 

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,670
gonna be
explicitly emphasized or anything like

30
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
explicitly emphasized or anything like
 

31
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,510
explicitly emphasized or anything like
that right you should know that

32
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
that right you should know that
 

33
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,590
that right you should know that
you know when we're storing graph data

34
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
you know when we're storing graph data
 

35
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,630
you know when we're storing graph data
structures

00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
that they can achieve certain running
 

39
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,750
that they can achieve certain running
time bounds and

40
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
time bounds and
 

41
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,590
time bounds and
and and that kind of thing but we're

42
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
and and that kind of thing but we're
 

43
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,869
and and that kind of thing but we're
really going to be concentrating on

44
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
really going to be concentrating on
 

45
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,510
really going to be concentrating on
graphs

46
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
graphs
 

47
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,110
graphs
the six lectures that we've had on

48
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
the six lectures that we've had on
 

49
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,150
the six lectures that we've had on
graphs the two on unweighted

00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
graph algorithms and the four that we
 

53
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,150
graph algorithms and the four that we
had on weighted graph algorithms

00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
had on weighted graph algorithms
 

55
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,469
had on weighted graph algorithms
they covered the material that was uh

56
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
they covered the material that was uh
 

57
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,429
they covered the material that was uh
covered in

58
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
covered in
 

59
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,070
covered in
the two problem sets uh problem set five

60
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
the two problem sets uh problem set five
 

61
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,670
the two problem sets uh problem set five
and problem set six now

62
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
and problem set six now
 

63
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,710
and problem set six now
uh we only usually this this material

64
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
uh we only usually this this material
 

65
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,190
uh we only usually this this material
covers

66
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
covers
 

67
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,429
covers
uh three problem sets worth of material

68
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
uh three problem sets worth of material
 

69
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,550
uh three problem sets worth of material
uh this term

70
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
uh this term
 

71
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,310
uh this term
it's covering two problem sets worth of

72
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
it's covering two problem sets worth of
 

73
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,910
it's covering two problem sets worth of
material uh so

74
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
material uh so
 

75
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,590
material uh so
just keep that in mind when you're when

76
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
just keep that in mind when you're when
 

77
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,590
just keep that in mind when you're when
you're studying and you wanna go look

78
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
you're studying and you wanna go look
 

79
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,230
you're studying and you wanna go look
back on

80
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
back on
 

81
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,749
back on
previous material okay in general

82
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
previous material okay in general
 

83
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,270
previous material okay in general
there's lots of graph problems that

84
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
there's lots of graph problems that
 

85
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,109
there's lots of graph problems that
we've talked about how to solve

86
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
we've talked about how to solve
 

87
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,950
we've talked about how to solve
there's really a small number of graph

88
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
there's really a small number of graph
 

89
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,630
there's really a small number of graph
algorithms but they can solve a lot of

90
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
algorithms but they can solve a lot of
 

91
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,910
algorithms but they can solve a lot of
different problems

92
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
different problems
 

93
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,230
different problems
okay and so we we saw two algorithms to

94
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
okay and so we we saw two algorithms to
 

95
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,230
okay and so we we saw two algorithms to
solve the graph reachability problem

96
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
solve the graph reachability problem
 

97
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,270
solve the graph reachability problem
single source uh what is reachable from

98
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
single source uh what is reachable from
 

99
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,389
single source uh what is reachable from
me

100
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
me
 

101
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,630
me
right uh and i can only search a

102
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
right uh and i can only search a
 

103
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,630
right uh and i can only search a
connected component of my graph

104
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
connected component of my graph
 

105
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,030
connected component of my graph
from me right and the connected

106
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
from me right and the connected
 

107
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,990
from me right and the connected
component from

108
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
component from
 

109
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,590
component from
me is actually upper bounded

110
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
me is actually upper bounded
 

111
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,749
me is actually upper bounded
asymptotically by the number of edges in

112
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
asymptotically by the number of edges in
 

113
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,550
asymptotically by the number of edges in
my graph

114
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
my graph
 

115
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,910
my graph
because a a spanning tree

116
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
because a a spanning tree
 

117
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,950
because a a spanning tree
of my component has at least or has v

118
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
of my component has at least or has v
 

119
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,229
of my component has at least or has v
plus one edges right and so

120
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
plus one edges right and so
 

121
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,309
plus one edges right and so
uh the number of vertices i can reach is

122
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
uh the number of vertices i can reach is
 

123
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,990
uh the number of vertices i can reach is
upper bounded by the number of edges

124
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
upper bounded by the number of edges
 

125
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,270
upper bounded by the number of edges
in my graph asymptotically anyway uh

126
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
in my graph asymptotically anyway uh
 

127
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,430
in my graph asymptotically anyway uh
graph then then uh we talked about

128
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
graph then then uh we talked about
 

129
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,350
graph then then uh we talked about
exploring an entire graph even if it's

130
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
exploring an entire graph even if it's
 

131
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,710
exploring an entire graph even if it's
disconnected

132
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
disconnected
 

133
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,390
disconnected
not necessarily from a source right just

134
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
not necessarily from a source right just
 

135
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,630
not necessarily from a source right just
just touching every vertex in a graph of

136
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
just touching every vertex in a graph of
 

137
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,750
just touching every vertex in a graph of
course we can just

138
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
course we can just
 

139
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,070
course we can just
you know touch every vertex in a graph

140
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
you know touch every vertex in a graph
 

141
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,509
you know touch every vertex in a graph
right i can look at the adjacency

142
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
right i can look at the adjacency
 

143
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,030
right i can look at the adjacency
representation of my graph

144
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
representation of my graph
 

145
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,110
representation of my graph
and just go through it but this is

146
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
and just go through it but this is
 

147
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,030
and just go through it but this is
really we're trying to explore the whole

148
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
really we're trying to explore the whole
 

149
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,830
really we're trying to explore the whole
graph maybe

150
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
graph maybe
 

151
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,670
graph maybe
count how many things are reachable from

152
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
count how many things are reachable from
 

153
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,869
count how many things are reachable from
each other

154
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
each other
 

155
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,830
each other
in the graph and this is what we had a

156
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
in the graph and this is what we had a
 

157
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,110
in the graph and this is what we had a
we talked about

158
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
we talked about
 

159
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,830
we talked about
exploring a graph and counting the size

160
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
exploring a graph and counting the size
 

161
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,589
exploring a graph and counting the size
of connected components in a graph

162
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
of connected components in a graph
 

163
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,910
of connected components in a graph
in an unweighted graph right and we

164
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
in an unweighted graph right and we
 

165
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,030
in an unweighted graph right and we
could do this via

166
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
could do this via
 

167
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,190
could do this via
full bfs or full dfs it's basically

168
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
full bfs or full dfs it's basically
 

169
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,030
full bfs or full dfs it's basically
putting a loop around

170
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
putting a loop around
 

171
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,710
putting a loop around
one of these graph reachability

172
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
one of these graph reachability

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
and when i'm done with a component i
 

181

00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
and explore it again okay and that still
 

187
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,430
and explore it again okay and that still
gets linear time in the graph v

188

00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
full dfs on that graph we could actually
 

201
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,550

get topological sort of that graph

202
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
get topological sort of that graph
 

203
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,470
get topological sort of that graph
basically an ordering

204
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
basically an ordering
 

205
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,670
basically an ordering
of the vertices in the graph such that

206
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
of the vertices in the graph such that
 

207
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,710
of the vertices in the graph such that
all edges go

208
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
all edges go
 

209
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,869
all edges go
in one direction with respect to that

210
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
in one direction with respect to that
 

211
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,390
in one direction with respect to that
ordering like all forward in that

212
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400

00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
ordering
 

215
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,509

right and we could actually use that to

216
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
right and we could actually use that to
 

217
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,830
right and we could actually use that to
detect cycles in a directed graph

218
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
detect cycles in a directed graph
 

219
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,949
detect cycles in a directed graph
by just looking at the topological

220
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
by just looking at the topological
 

221
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,990
by just looking at the topological
sort order and seeing if if

222
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
sort order and seeing if if
 

223
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,990
sort order and seeing if if
look at the finishing time the reverse

224
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
look at the finishing time the reverse
 

225
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,309
look at the finishing time the reverse
finishing time order of dfs

226
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
finishing time order of dfs
 

227
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,309
finishing time order of dfs
and just checking to see whether it was

228
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
and just checking to see whether it was
 

229
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,229
and just checking to see whether it was
a topological sorter right because any

230
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
a topological sorter right because any
 

231
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,509

233
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,869
back edge there
would correspond to a cycle in our graph

234
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879

235
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,630
would correspond to a cycle in our graph
because the proposition was that if our

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
doing this procedure would give us a
 

241
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,710
doing this procedure would give us a
topological report okay then we

242
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
topological report okay then we
 

243
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,150

00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
was able to detect and find negative
 

247
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,790

that's no longer a correct algorithm

346
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
that's no longer a correct algorithm
 

347
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,230
that's no longer a correct algorithm
right and so you're going to get fewer

348
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
right and so you're going to get fewer
 

349
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,950
right and so you're going to get fewer
points

350
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960

351
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,029

than if you happen to use an inefficient

00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039

353
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,309

algorithm that is correct

354
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319

355
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,029

right so if i just whenever i saw

356
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
right so if i just whenever i saw
 

357
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,309

359
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,189

i used bellman ford right it's the

360
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
i used bellman ford right it's the
 

361
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,950
i used bellman ford right it's the
slowest thing

362
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
slowest thing
 

363
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,230

that's probably going to be a correct

364
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
that's probably going to be a correct
 

365
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,909
that's probably going to be a correct
algorithm it's not necessarily going to

366
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
algorithm it's not necessarily going to
 

367
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,270
algorithm it's not necessarily going to
be the most efficient algorithm

368
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
be the most efficient algorithm
 

369
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,110
be the most efficient algorithm
but you'll get more points because it is

370
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
but you'll get more points because it is
 

371
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,469
but you'll get more points because it is

372
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
a correct algorithm
 

373
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,830
a correct algorithm
then if you apply a faster algorithm

374
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
then if you apply a faster algorithm
 

375
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,430
then if you apply a faster algorithm
that doesn't apply to your problem

376
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
that doesn't apply to your problem
 

377
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,830
that doesn't apply to your problem
because it's not going to solve it

378
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
because it's not going to solve it
 

379
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,230
because it's not going to solve it
correctly

380
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240

381
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,590

does that make sense okay so

382
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
does that make sense okay so
 

383
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,710
does that make sense okay so
and then in the last lecture we had

384
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
and then in the last lecture we had
 

385
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,950
and then in the last lecture we had
we talked about all pair shortest paths

386
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
we talked about all pair shortest paths
 

387
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,830
we talked about all pair shortest paths
and

388
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
and
 

389
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,990
and
really running a single source for just

390
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
really running a single source for just
 

391
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,510
really running a single source for just
paths from each vertex

392
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
paths from each vertex
 

393
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,510
paths from each vertex
is pretty good in most circumstances

394
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
is pretty good in most circumstances
 

395
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,270
is pretty good in most circumstances
we don't know how to do a lot better for

396
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
we don't know how to do a lot better for
 

397
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,270
we don't know how to do a lot better for
for a lot of these and then

398
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
for a lot of these and then
 

399
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,950
for a lot of these and then
johnson gives us

400
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
johnson gives us
 

401
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,150
johnson gives us
basically in this last line of our graph

402
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
basically in this last line of our graph
 

403
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,390
basically in this last line of our graph
restrictions and weight restrictions

404
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400

405
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,870
restrictions and weight restrictions
uh where bellman ford is right there we

406
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
uh where bellman ford is right there we
 

407
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,629
uh where bellman ford is right there we
can actually get a speed up over v

408
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
can actually get a speed up over v
 

409
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,670
can actually get a speed up over v
times bellman ford uh by

410
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
times bellman ford uh by
 

411
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,670
times bellman ford uh by
kind of two tricks right

412
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680

 

413
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,909

re-weight the find if the graph has

414
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
re-weight the find if the graph has
 

415
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,270
re-weight the find if the graph has
negative weight cycles

416
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
negative weight cycles
 

417
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,589
negative weight cycles
and if it doesn't then there exists a

418
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
and if it doesn't then there exists a
 

419
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,350
and if it doesn't then there exists a
re-weighting of this graph

420
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
re-weighting of this graph
 

421
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,230
re-weighting of this graph
so that all the weights are non-negative

422
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
so that all the weights are non-negative
 

423
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,990
so that all the weights are non-negative
but the shortest paths are preserved and

424
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
but the shortest paths are preserved and
 

425
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,029
but the shortest paths are preserved and
so we can use

426
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
so we can use
 

427
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,189
so we can use
dijkstra v times and get that that

428
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
dijkstra v times and get that that
 

429
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,469
dijkstra v times and get that that
running time instead

430
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
running time instead
 

431
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,670
running time instead
okay so that's that's just an overview

432
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
okay so that's that's just an overview
 

433
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,430
okay so that's that's just an overview

and then we relax edges forward in that

458
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
and then we relax edges forward in that
 

459
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,749
and then we relax edges forward in that

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
that's that's kind of the invariant that
 

515
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,269
that's that's kind of the invariant that
we're having with dijkstra and then

516
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
we're having with dijkstra and then
 

517
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,710
we're having with dijkstra and then

essentially duplicates our graph so that

520
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
essentially duplicates our graph so that
 

521
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,389
essentially duplicates our graph so that
each node corresponds to reaching a

522
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
each node corresponds to reaching a
 

523
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,990
each node corresponds to reaching a
vertex

524
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
vertex
 

525
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,190
vertex
using at most a certain number of edges

526
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
using at most a certain number of edges
 

527
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,990
using at most a certain number of edges
and then that duplicated graph is a dag

528
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
and then that duplicated graph is a dag
 

529
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,910
and then that duplicated graph is a dag
and we can run dag relaxation

530
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
and we can run dag relaxation
 

531
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,750
and we can run dag relaxation
so that's the basic idea of all these

532
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
so that's the basic idea of all these
 

533
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,030
so that's the basic idea of all these

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
uh there's a couple things to keep in
 

539
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,910
uh there's a couple things to keep in
mind there's kind of two

mind there's kind of two
 

541
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,750
mind there's kind of two
two things that we have to worry about

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
two things that we have to worry about
 

543
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,430
two things that we have to worry about
when we're you're looking at a graph

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:47,910
a sparse graph or something like that
right

682
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
right
 

683
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,269
right
that's a little easier to think about

684
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
that's a little easier to think about
 

685
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,509
that's a little easier to think about
for when applying this material

686
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
for when applying this material
 

687
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,430
for when applying this material
okay and so con converting your problem

688
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
okay and so con converting your problem
 

689
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,750
okay and so con converting your problem
into a finding a shortest path problem

690
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
into a finding a shortest path problem
 

691
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,190
into a finding a shortest path problem
or finding a cycle or finding a

692
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
or finding a cycle or finding a
 

693
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,110
or finding a cycle or finding a
topological sword or connected component

694
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
topological sword or connected component
 

695
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,389
topological sword or connected component
or a negative weight cycle or any of

696
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
or a negative weight cycle or any of
 

697
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,829
or a negative weight cycle or any of
these kinds of things

698
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
these kinds of things
 

699
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,910
these kinds of things
right can make it easier for you to

700
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
right can make it easier for you to
 

701
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,949
right can make it easier for you to
think about

702
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
think about
 

703
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,790
think about
uh it's not like fundamental material in

704
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
uh it's not like fundamental material in
 

705
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,069
uh it's not like fundamental material in
this class that's that's

706
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
this class that's that's
 

707
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,310
this class that's that's
that's super uh that we need to lecture

708
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
that's super uh that we need to lecture
 

709
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,629
that's super uh that we need to lecture
on but it is really important for you

710
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
on but it is really important for you
 

711
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,150
on but it is really important for you
when you're out in the real world

712
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
when you're out in the real world
 

713
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,230
when you're out in the real world
looking at problems to be able to make

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,430
looking at problems to be able to make
that transformation

716
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
that transformation
 

717
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,629

think of this as a modeling

722
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
think of this as a modeling
 

723
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,069
think of this as a modeling
part of the problem but in general once

724
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
part of the problem but in general once
 

725
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,949
part of the problem but in general once
you've got that nice abstract problem

726
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
you've got that nice abstract problem
 

727
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,110
you've got that nice abstract problem
uh then in general you you might have a

728
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
uh then in general you you might have a
 

729
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,269
uh then in general you you might have a
graph but it might not be the graph that

730
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
graph but it might not be the graph that
 

731
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,350

733
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,790
you the only graph you want when you're
solving this problem right that might be

734
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
solving this problem right that might be
 

735
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,870
solving this problem right that might be
the input graph that you have

736
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
the input graph that you have
 

737
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,590
the input graph that you have
but in general a lot of the kind of

738
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
but in general a lot of the kind of

their correctness and things like that
 

751
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,110
their correctness and things like that
that's maybe not something you want to

752
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
that's maybe not something you want to
 

753
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,030
that's maybe not something you want to
be doing on an exam

754
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
be doing on an exam
 

755
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,949
be doing on an exam
because then you're going to be writing

756
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
because then you're going to be writing
 

757
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,870
because then you're going to be writing
pages of derivation and proof

that these algorithms work this unit in

760
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
that these algorithms work this unit in

is much more on the let's reduce to some

764
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
is much more on the let's reduce to some

very powerful black box that we showed

766
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
very powerful black box that we showed
 

767
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,389
very powerful black box that we showed
you how it works

768
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
you how it works
 

769
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,670
you how it works
and so because that's the framework here

770
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
and so because that's the framework here
 

771
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,829
and so because that's the framework here
the way in which we introduce complexity

772
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
the way in which we introduce complexity
 

773
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,710
the way in which we introduce complexity
into problems

774
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
into problems
 

775
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,350
into problems
is to make the graph non-obvious on the

776
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
is to make the graph non-obvious on the
 

777
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,269
is to make the graph non-obvious on the
thing that you're supposed to apply

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
thing that you're supposed to apply
 

779
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,310
thing that you're supposed to apply
right and so the graph that we give you

780
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
right and so the graph that we give you
 

781
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,069
right and so the graph that we give you
as the input may be different than the

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
here are some
 

789
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,310
here are some

at that vertex right you know in your
 

811
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,990
at that vertex right you know in your
problem session you had this guy who's

812
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
problem session you had this guy who's
 

813
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,550
problem session you had this guy who's
drinking when he got to bars right and

814
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
drinking when he got to bars right and
 

815
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,710
drinking when he got to bars right and
or or every third time and you need to

816
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
or or every third time and you need to
 

817
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,790
or or every third time and you need to
remember how many times it's been since

818
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
remember how many times it's been since
 

819
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,389

i've been to a bar
 

821
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,550
i've been to a bar
right or i had a drunk at a bar and and

822
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
right or i had a drunk at a bar and and
 

823

right or i had a drunk at a bar and and
so you can duplicate the vertices to be

824
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
so you can duplicate the vertices to be
 

825
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,269
so you can duplicate the vertices to be
able to

right you can simulate that without

840
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
right you can simulate that without
 

841
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,269
right you can simulate that without
having to run an

842
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
having to run an
 

843
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,350
having to run an
algorithm many times you can simulate

algorithm many times you can simulate
 

845
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,870
algorithm many times you can simulate
that by adding a

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
that by adding a
 

847
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,790
that by adding a
an auxiliary node an extra node in your

848
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
an auxiliary node an extra node in your
 

849
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,310
an auxiliary node an extra node in your
graph with edges

850
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
graph with edges
 

851
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,790
graph with edges
to those sources or to those sinks

852
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800

 

853
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,870

and run a a single source shortest path

854
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
and run a a single source shortest path
 

855
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,389
and run a a single source shortest path
algorithm from that that

856
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
algorithm from that that
 

857
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,829
algorithm from that that
that super node sometimes we call it uh

858
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
that super node sometimes we call it uh
 

859
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,150
that super node sometimes we call it uh
to get better performance it's kind of a

860
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
to get better performance it's kind of a
 

861
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,430
to get better performance it's kind of a
an efficiency

862
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
an efficiency
 

863
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,670
an efficiency
we're adding efficiency by changing our

864
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
we're adding efficiency by changing our
 

865
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,069
we're adding efficiency by changing our
graph to fit the algorithms that we know

866
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
graph to fit the algorithms that we know
 

867
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,670
graph to fit the algorithms that we know
to solve efficiently

868
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
to solve efficiently
 

869
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,829
to solve efficiently
and then the last thing maybe it helps

870
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
and then the last thing maybe it helps
 

871
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,150
and then the last thing maybe it helps
to pre-process the graph in some way

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,870
even though the problem statement seems
kind of seems like they should be

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
kind of seems like they should be
 

887
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,030
kind of seems like they should be
traversable in either direction

888
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
traversable in either direction
 

889
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,189

an interesting question
and then preprocessing kind of filtering

930
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
and then preprocessing kind of filtering
 

931
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,150
and then preprocessing kind of filtering
out the graph or transforming it in some

967
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,949

what are some common ways people uh lose

968
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
what are some common ways people uh lose
 

969
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,550
what are some common ways people uh lose
points that's that's great thing

970
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
points that's that's great thing
 

971
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,509
points that's that's great thing
we i'll add it to the notes uh when we

972
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
we i'll add it to the notes uh when we
 

973
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,389
we i'll add it to the notes uh when we
post

974
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
post
 

975
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,710
post
uh so common things that people lose

976
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
uh so common things that people lose
 

977
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,069
uh so common things that people lose
points on in this unit when they're

00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
points on in this unit when they're
 

979
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,710
points on in this unit when they're
solving problems

980
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
solving problems
 

981
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,069
solving problems
you're given a word problem and you

982
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
you're given a word problem and you
 

983
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,749
you're given a word problem and you
don't define a graph

984
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
don't define a graph
 

985
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,629
don't define a graph
right super it's as easy as that you

986
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
right super it's as easy as that you
 

987
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,110
right super it's as easy as that you
start

988
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
start
 

989
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,670
start
solving assuming that we know what graph

990
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
solving assuming that we know what graph
 

991
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,030
solving assuming that we know what graph
you're talking about

992
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
you're talking about
 

993
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,590
you're talking about
when the implicit graph in the problem

994
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
when the implicit graph in the problem
 

995
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,669
when the implicit graph in the problem
may or may not be correct but we don't

996
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
may or may not be correct but we don't
 

997
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,189
may or may not be correct but we don't
there's no graph defined in the problem

998
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
there's no graph defined in the problem
 

999
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,549
there's no graph defined in the problem
right so you need to define a graph in

1000
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
right so you need to define a graph in
 

1001
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,069
right so you need to define a graph in
the problem so that's the first thing

1002
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
the problem so that's the first thing
 

1003
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,549
the problem so that's the first thing
the second thing is a lot of times it's

1004
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
the second thing is a lot of times it's
 

1005
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,630
the second thing is a lot of times it's
really useful just as a strategy

1006
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:16,640
really useful just as a strategy
 

1007
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,029
really useful just as a strategy
when you construct that graph tell us

1008
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
when you construct that graph tell us
 

1009
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,510
when you construct that graph tell us
how many vertices and edges are in it

1010
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
how many vertices and edges are in it
 

1011
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,390
how many vertices and edges are in it
tell if tell us if it's acyclic right

1012
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
tell if tell us if it's acyclic right
 

1013
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,990
tell if tell us if it's acyclic right
tell us what the weights are on each

1014
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
tell us what the weights are on each
 

1015
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,110
tell us what the weights are on each

to solve that problem on the graph
right and if you happen to choose the

1072
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
right and if you happen to choose the
 

1073
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,789
right and if you happen to choose the
wrong algorithm then maybe

that's like separating off the problem

1076
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
that's like separating off the problem
 

1077
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,430
that's like separating off the problem
from your implementation of how you

solved that problem
 

1081
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,590
solved that problem
can maybe help you get some points for

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
can maybe help you get some points for
 

1083
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,430
can maybe help you get some points for
stating the problem you're solving

1084
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
stating the problem you're solving
 

1085
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,990
stating the problem you're solving
even if you choose the wrong or an

even if you choose the wrong or an
 

1087
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,669

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,549
you're mostly relying on the correctness
of the algorithm so you don't need to do

1160
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
of the algorithm so you don't need to do
 

1161
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,990
of the algorithm so you don't need to do
much on the correctness side okay but

all right
so these uh problems that we're gonna

1182
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
so these uh problems that we're gonna
 

1183
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,909
so these uh problems that we're gonna
solve

1184
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
solve
 

1185
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,110
solve
are from uh spring 18

1186
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
are from uh spring 18
 

1187
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,549
are from uh spring 18
quiz two uh slightly modified

1188
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
quiz two uh slightly modified
 

1189
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,190
quiz two uh slightly modified
um but uh you know we're just gonna go

1190
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
um but uh you know we're just gonna go
 

1191
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,149
um but uh you know we're just gonna go
through them

1192
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:32,159
through them
 

1193
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,549
through them
uh one at a time so the first problem we

1194
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
uh one at a time so the first problem we
 

1195
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,510
uh one at a time so the first problem we
have

1196
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
have
 

1197
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,630
have
uh we have an image of black and white

1198
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
uh we have an image of black and white
 

1199
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,549
uh we have an image of black and white
squares so this is like a pixel grid

1200
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
squares so this is like a pixel grid
 

1201
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,310
squares so this is like a pixel grid
you think of it like as a you know a

1202
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
you think of it like as a you know a
 

1203
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,230
you think of it like as a you know a
bitmap on your computer

1204
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
bitmap on your computer
 

1205
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,430
bitmap on your computer
right and what we say is each

1206
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
right and what we say is each
 

1207
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,310
right and what we say is each
white pixel is contained in a blob okay

1208
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
white pixel is contained in a blob okay
 

1209
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,870
white pixel is contained in a blob okay
but what

1210
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
but what
 

1211
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,270
but what
what what is a blob i don't know right

1212
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
what what is a blob i don't know right
 

1213
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,870
what what is a blob i don't know right
okay i'm kind of giving you an

1214
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
okay i'm kind of giving you an
 

1215
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,510
okay i'm kind of giving you an
implicit representation definition of

1216
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
implicit representation definition of
 

1217
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,789
implicit representation definition of
what a blob is

1218
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
what a blob is
 

1219
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,270
what a blob is
two white pixels are in the same blob if

1220
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
two white pixels are in the same blob if
 

1221
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,870
two white pixels are in the same blob if
they share an edge of the grid

1222
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
they share an edge of the grid
 

1223
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,070
they share an edge of the grid
okay so this kind of tells me this

1224
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
okay so this kind of tells me this
 

1225
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,669
okay so this kind of tells me this
this graph has an edge if these these

1226
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
this graph has an edge if these these
 

1227
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,909
this graph has an edge if these these
pixels are adjacent they're both white

1228
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
pixels are adjacent they're both white
 

1229
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,750
pixels are adjacent they're both white
right that's what it means but

1230
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
right that's what it means but
 

1231
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,110
right that's what it means but
an interesting part about that

1232
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
an interesting part about that
 

1233
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,350
an interesting part about that
definition is that it kind of is

1234
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,360
definition is that it kind of is
 

1235
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,230
definition is that it kind of is
transitive

1236
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
transitive
 

1237
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,390
transitive
right if i have a white pixel that

1238
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
right if i have a white pixel that
 

1239
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,909
right if i have a white pixel that
shares an edge with

1240
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
shares an edge with
 

1241
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,430
shares an edge with
a white pixel a that shares a uh what

1242
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
a white pixel a that shares a uh what
 

1243
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,430
a white pixel a that shares a uh what
let's start writing things on the board

1244
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
let's start writing things on the board
 

1245
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,549
let's start writing things on the board
shall we

1246
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
shall we
 

1247
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,310
shall we
probably instead of me just talking at

1248
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
probably instead of me just talking at
 

1249
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,070
probably instead of me just talking at
you

1250
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
you
 

1251
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,549
you
right we have kind of a pixel grid here

1252
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559

 

1253
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,549

okay and i don't know how to do this

1254
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
okay and i don't know how to do this
 

1255
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,230
okay and i don't know how to do this
with the chalkboard because it's white

1256
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
with the chalkboard because it's white
 

1257
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,669
with the chalkboard because it's white
versus black i guess

1258
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
versus black i guess
 

1259
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,149
versus black i guess
i have to color in the white things

1260
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
i have to color in the white things
 

1261
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:53,110
i have to color in the white things
these are all white

1262
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120

 

1263
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,310

all right so these guys

1264
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
all right so these guys
 

1265
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,630
all right so these guys
are in the same blob right because they

1266
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
are in the same blob right because they
 

1267
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,669
are in the same blob right because they
share an edge

1268
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
share an edge
 

1269
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,950
share an edge
these guys are in the same blob okay but

1270
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
these guys are in the same blob okay but
 

1271
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,590
these guys are in the same blob okay but
because they share an edge in the pixel

1272
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
because they share an edge in the pixel
 

1273
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,230
because they share an edge in the pixel
grid

1274
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
grid
 

1275
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,750
grid
these guys are also in the same blob

1276
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
these guys are also in the same blob
 

1277
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,950
these guys are also in the same blob
because if these are in the same blob

1278
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
because if these are in the same blob
 

1279
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,230
because if these are in the same blob
and these are in the same blob

1280
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,240
and these are in the same blob
 

1281
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,830
and these are in the same blob
there's a transitivity argument here

1282
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
there's a transitivity argument here
 

1283
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,430
there's a transitivity argument here
right this this guy needs to be in the

1284
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
right this this guy needs to be in the
 

1285
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,110
right this this guy needs to be in the
same blob as that guy

1286
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
same blob as that guy
 

1287
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,510
same blob as that guy
and then it says that black pixels are

1288
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
and then it says that black pixels are
 

1289
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,029
and then it says that black pixels are
not in any blob

1290
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
not in any blob
 

1291
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,630
not in any blob
okay and so i'm given an n by m array

1292
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
okay and so i'm given an n by m array
 

1293
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,310
okay and so i'm given an n by m array
i never remember which one comes first

1294
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
i never remember which one comes first
 

1295
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,070
i never remember which one comes first
but we have dimensions of this thing as

1296
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
but we have dimensions of this thing as
 

1297
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,510
but we have dimensions of this thing as
n by m

1298
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
n by m
 

1299
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,789
n by m
so we have n times m pixels uh and so

1300
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
so we have n times m pixels uh and so
 

1301
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,750
so we have n times m pixels uh and so
we're describing

1302
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
we're describing
 

1303
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,710
we're describing
uh essentially in a linear time

1304
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
uh essentially in a linear time
 

1305
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,830
uh essentially in a linear time
algorithm

1306
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
algorithm
 

1307
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,909
algorithm
to compute the number of blobs in the

1308
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
to compute the number of blobs in the
 

1309
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,390
to compute the number of blobs in the
image why do i say linear time

1310
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
image why do i say linear time
 

1311
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,470
image why do i say linear time
it's because for every pixel in my grid

1312
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
it's because for every pixel in my grid
 

1313
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,549
it's because for every pixel in my grid
i needed to give you a specification of

1314
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
i needed to give you a specification of
 

1315
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,230
i needed to give you a specification of
whether that was

1316
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
whether that was
 

1317
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,510
whether that was
white or black right and so yeah if i

1318
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
white or black right and so yeah if i
 

1319
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,029
white or black right and so yeah if i
naively gave you

1320
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
naively gave you
 

1321
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,070
naively gave you
the input of this algorithm with a word

1322
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
the input of this algorithm with a word
 

1323
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,270
the input of this algorithm with a word
per per one of these pixels that would

1324
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
per per one of these pixels that would
 

1325
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,950
per per one of these pixels that would
be the input size of my

1326
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
be the input size of my
 

1327
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,350
be the input size of my
right and so even though this has looks

1328
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
right and so even though this has looks
 

1329
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,630
right and so even though this has looks
quadratic

1330
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
quadratic
 

1331
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,990
quadratic
right the actual input size has

1332
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
right the actual input size has
 

1333
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,190
right the actual input size has
is what we define as linear

1334
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
is what we define as linear
 

1335
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,789
is what we define as linear
right and so we're looking for a linear

1336
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
right and so we're looking for a linear
 

1337
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,549
right and so we're looking for a linear
time algorithm to count the number of

1338
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
time algorithm to count the number of
 

1339
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,830
time algorithm to count the number of
blobs in the image okay

1340
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
blobs in the image okay
 

1341
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,470
blobs in the image okay
so what is a this is a little

1342
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
so what is a this is a little
 

1343
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,830
so what is a this is a little
underspecified as a problem i admit

1344
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840
underspecified as a problem i admit
 

1345
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,390
underspecified as a problem i admit
um i i hate to admit that i was involved

1346
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
um i i hate to admit that i was involved
 

1347
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,789
um i i hate to admit that i was involved
in

1348
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
in
 

1349
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,830
in
this class at that time but the idea

1350
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
this class at that time but the idea
 

1351
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,230
this class at that time but the idea
here

1352
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
here
 

1353
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,430
here
is if these are uh share an

1354
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
is if these are uh share an
 

1355
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,510
is if these are uh share an
edge then everything the the observation

1356
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
edge then everything the the observation
 

1357
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,510
edge then everything the the observation
here is if i just draw this picture

1358
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
here is if i just draw this picture
 

1359
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,390
here is if i just draw this picture
i notice that anything kind of that's

1360
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
i notice that anything kind of that's
 

1361
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,269
i notice that anything kind of that's
reachable

is going to be in the same blob right so

1366
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
is going to be in the same blob right so
 

1367
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,909
is going to be in the same blob right so
this is a blob

1368
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
this is a blob
 

1369
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,510
this is a blob
and this is a blob and this is a blob

1370
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
and this is a blob and this is a blob
 

1371
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,190
and this is a blob and this is a blob
and this is a blob but

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
and this is a blob but
 

1373
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,149
and this is a blob but
right there's no path here this this

1374
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
right there's no path here this this
 

1375
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,830
right there's no path here this this
black part is not part of a blob now

1376
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
black part is not part of a blob now
 

1377
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,870
black part is not part of a blob now
actually there's nothing in this

1378
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
actually there's nothing in this
 

1379
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,470
actually there's nothing in this
specification

1380
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
specification
 

1381
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,350
specification
that doesn't say that says that we

1382
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
that doesn't say that says that we
 

1383
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,950
that doesn't say that says that we
couldn't have these things be in the

1384
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
couldn't have these things be in the
 

1385
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,310
couldn't have these things be in the
same blob

1386
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
same blob
 

1387
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,390
same blob
okay so that's a little confusing maybe

1388
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
okay so that's a little confusing maybe
 

1389
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,149
okay so that's a little confusing maybe
a source of error that there's a source

1390
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
a source of error that there's a source
 

1391
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,590
a source of error that there's a source
of error that i had when reading this

1392
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
of error that i had when reading this
 

1393
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,750

problem after a couple years

1394
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
problem after a couple years
 

1395
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,510
problem after a couple years
um but you know

1396
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
um but you know
 

1397
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,310
um but you know
when you are looking at a problem the if

1398
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
when you are looking at a problem the if
 

1399
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,630
when you are looking at a problem the if
if

1400
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
if
 

1401
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,990
if
everything could just be in the same

1402
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
everything could just be in the same
 

1403
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,909
everything could just be in the same
blob then you just return one and this

1404
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
blob then you just return one and this
 

1405
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,510
blob then you just return one and this
problem is not so interesting

1406
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
problem is not so interesting
 

1407
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,590
problem is not so interesting
right so the right way to interpret this

1408
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
right so the right way to interpret this
 

1409
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,830
right so the right way to interpret this
problem i mean i would not need

1410
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
problem i mean i would not need
 

1411
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,430
problem i mean i would not need
n times m time i could just say

1412
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
n times m time i could just say
 

1413
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,710
n times m time i could just say
one right so in in some sense

1414
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:34,720
one right so in in some sense
 

1415
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,390
one right so in in some sense
i'd like there to be something

1416
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
i'd like there to be something
 

1417
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,830
i'd like there to be something
interesting in this problem

1418
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:37,840
interesting in this problem
 

1419
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,789
interesting in this problem
uh and and having these things that are

1420
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
uh and and having these things that are
 

1421
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,669
uh and and having these things that are
not reachable from

1422
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
not reachable from
 

1423
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,149
not reachable from
each other be different blobs is kind of

1424
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
each other be different blobs is kind of
 

1425
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,590
each other be different blobs is kind of
the more algorithmically interesting

1426
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
the more algorithmically interesting
 

1427
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,549
the more algorithmically interesting
thing to have

1428
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
thing to have
 

1429
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,510
thing to have
and so what what is this then right this

1430
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
and so what what is this then right this
 

1431
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,230
and so what what is this then right this
is just

1432
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
is just
 

1433
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,269
is just
a pixel grid there's there's adjacencies

1434
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
a pixel grid there's there's adjacencies
 

1435
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,990
a pixel grid there's there's adjacencies
right there's connections between pixels

1436
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
right there's connections between pixels
 

1437
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,029
right there's connections between pixels
but in particular

1438
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
but in particular
 

1439
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,870
but in particular
i really only care about the connections

1440
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
i really only care about the connections
 

1441
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,430
i really only care about the connections
between white pixels right

1442
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
between white pixels right
 

1443
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,870
between white pixels right
hard to draw on here

1444
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
hard to draw on here
 

1445
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,950
hard to draw on here
but this component has a graph that

1446
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
but this component has a graph that
 

1447
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,269

were to construct this graph
 

1457
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,110
were to construct this graph
we would have an unweighted graph such

1458
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
we would have an unweighted graph such
 

1459
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,269
we would have an unweighted graph such

that the number of blobs
in my pic image would be

you're just constructing a graph

1488
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
you're just constructing a graph
 

1489
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,870
you're just constructing a graph
and i have no idea what you're doing to

1490
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
and i have no idea what you're doing to
 

1491
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,630
and i have no idea what you're doing to
that graph right you have to tell me

1492
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
that graph right you have to tell me
 

1493
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,710
that graph right you have to tell me
part of it it's about communication to

1494
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
part of it it's about communication to
 

1495
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,750
part of it it's about communication to
us

1496
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
us
 

1497
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,909
us
uh so how do i construct this graph well

1498
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:55,919
uh so how do i construct this graph well
 

1499
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,269
uh so how do i construct this graph well
i can just

1500
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
i can just
 

1501
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,029
i can just
loop through all of the pixels right

1502
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
loop through all of the pixels right
 

1503
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,269

look at its four neighbors at most for

1504
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
look at its four neighbors at most for
 

1505
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,549
look at its four neighbors at most for
and if those uh things

1506
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
and if those uh things
 

1507
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,390
and if those uh things
share are both white then i add an edge

1508
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
share are both white then i add an edge
 

1509
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,750
share are both white then i add an edge
we have a we have we're going to

1510
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
we have a we have we're going to
 

1511
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,830
we have a we have we're going to
essentially have a

1512
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
essentially have a
 

1513
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,430
essentially have a
graph we're going to construct a graph

1514
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,440
graph we're going to construct a graph
 

1515
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,590
graph we're going to construct a graph
this i told you to do this okay

1516
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
this i told you to do this okay
 

1517
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,990
this i told you to do this okay
so what is v here then uh v

1518
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
so what is v here then uh v
 

1519
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,190
so what is v here then uh v
is a

1520
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200
is a
 

1521
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,549
is a
vertex for

1522
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
vertex for
 

1523
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,830
vertex for
each white

1524
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840

 

1525
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,990

pixel

1526
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
pixel
 

1527
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,310
pixel
right and i can just i mean from the

1528
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
right and i can just i mean from the
 

1529
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,909
right and i can just i mean from the
beginning i can just

1530
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
beginning i can just
 

1531
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,070
beginning i can just
walk through all the things find all the

1532
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
walk through all the things find all the
 

1533
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,190
walk through all the things find all the
white vertices

1534
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
white vertices
 

1535
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,590
white vertices
maybe i identify them uniquely by their

1536
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
maybe i identify them uniquely by their
 

1537
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,230
maybe i identify them uniquely by their
x y coordinates in this

1538
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
x y coordinates in this
 

1539
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,590
x y coordinates in this
in this grid that's fine okay so now i

1540
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
in this grid that's fine okay so now i
 

1541
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,950
in this grid that's fine okay so now i
have all the vertices and now i want to

1542
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:54,960
have all the vertices and now i want to
 

1543
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,149
have all the vertices and now i want to
see what the edges are

1544
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
see what the edges are
 

1545
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,110
see what the edges are
i can loop through the pixels again and

1546
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120
i can loop through the pixels again and
 

1547
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,630
i can loop through the pixels again and
just look at its four

1548
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
just look at its four
 

1549
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,549
just look at its four
possible adjacencies see if any of them

1550
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
possible adjacencies see if any of them
 

1551
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,710
possible adjacencies see if any of them
are white stick that edge in this set

1552
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
are white stick that edge in this set
 

1553
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,029
are white stick that edge in this set
so edge is

1554
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039

 

1555
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,269

any two

1556
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279

 

1557
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,830

white pixels

1558
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:18,840

 

1559
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,250

that share

1560
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:21,260
that share
 

1561
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,789
that share
[Music]

1562
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
[Music]
 

1563
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,389
[Music]
an edge

1564
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:26,399

 

1565
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,870

okay so i can construct both of these

1566
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
okay so i can construct both of these
 

1567
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,630
okay so i can construct both of these
things in

1568
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640
things in
 

1569
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,070
things in
this in order n times m because there's

1570
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
this in order n times m because there's
 

1571
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,750
this in order n times m because there's
at most that many vertices

1572
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:35,760
at most that many vertices
 

1573
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,389
at most that many vertices
i just loop through them and the edges

1574
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:38,399
i just loop through them and the edges
 

1575
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,909
i just loop through them and the edges
for each pixel i'm only checking a

1576
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
for each pixel i'm only checking a
 

1577
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,269
for each pixel i'm only checking a
constant number of things

1578
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
constant number of things
 

1579
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,710
constant number of things
and i'm adding them to a set so the

1580
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:42,720
and i'm adding them to a set so the
 

1581
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,029
and i'm adding them to a set so the
number of edges the size of

1582
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
number of edges the size of
 

1583
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,950
number of edges the size of
the number of vertices in my graph is at

1584
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
the number of vertices in my graph is at
 

1585
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,630
the number of vertices in my graph is at
most n times m

1586
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
most n times m
 

1587
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,669
most n times m
and the number of edges is at most

1588
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
and the number of edges is at most
 

1589
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,990
and the number of edges is at most
n times m times four right it's upper

1590
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
n times m times four right it's upper
 

1591
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,350
n times m times four right it's upper
bounded by that because that's the

1592
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
bounded by that because that's the
 

1593
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,789
bounded by that because that's the
number of adjacencies i have in the

1594
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
number of adjacencies i have in the
 

1595
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,510
number of adjacencies i have in the
graph

1596
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
graph
 

1597
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,990
graph
okay you can probably get a better bound

1598
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
okay you can probably get a better bound
 

1599
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,350
okay you can probably get a better bound
in terms of the number of vertices right

1600
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
in terms of the number of vertices right
 

1601
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,470
in terms of the number of vertices right
it can be at most

1602
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
it can be at most
 

1603
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,269
it can be at most
v times four right but that's that's a

1604
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
v times four right but that's that's a
 

1605
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,630
v times four right but that's that's a
little stronger it doesn't really matter

1606
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
little stronger it doesn't really matter
 

1607
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,310
little stronger it doesn't really matter
we're trying to get within the

1608
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320
we're trying to get within the
 

1609
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,430
we're trying to get within the
order n times m time bound so anything's

1610
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
order n times m time bound so anything's
 

1611
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,789
order n times m time bound so anything's
fine here so that's the graph we

1612
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
fine here so that's the graph we
 

1613
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,510
fine here so that's the graph we
construct

1614
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:13,520
construct
 

1615
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,870
construct
and then we can run full bfs or full dfs

1616
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:16,880
and then we can run full bfs or full dfs
 

1617
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,310
and then we can run full bfs or full dfs
we've identified a graph

1618
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,320
we've identified a graph
 

1619
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,149
we've identified a graph
we've identified that we want to count

1620
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:20,159
we've identified that we want to count
 

1621
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,669
we've identified that we want to count
the number of connected components in my

1622
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
the number of connected components in my
 

1623
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,110
the number of connected components in my
graph

1624
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
graph
 

1625
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,230
graph
so idea right

1626
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,240
so idea right
 

1627
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,350
so idea right
count connect

1628
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,360
count connect
 

1629
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,549
count connect
connected components and then

1630
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:32,559
connected components and then
 

1631
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,470
connected components and then
for example using full

1632
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
for example using full
 

1633
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,070
for example using full
bfs or full

1634
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
bfs or full
 

1635
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,710
bfs or full
dfs right i wouldn't want you to write

1636
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
dfs right i wouldn't want you to write
 

1637
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,310
dfs right i wouldn't want you to write
both of these algorithms there

1638
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,320
both of these algorithms there
 

1639
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,310
both of these algorithms there
but when we write up our solutions we

1640
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
but when we write up our solutions we
 

1641
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,350
but when we write up our solutions we
want them to

1642
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
want them to
 

1643
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,590
want them to
uh you know cover the space of student

1644
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:49,600
uh you know cover the space of student
 

1645
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,389
uh you know cover the space of student
solutions

1646
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,399
solutions
 

1647
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,230
solutions
and so we will usually mention it you

1648
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
and so we will usually mention it you
 

1649
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,149
and so we will usually mention it you
only have to mention one of them

1650
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
only have to mention one of them
 

1651
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,549
only have to mention one of them
and because these run in linear time

1652
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
and because these run in linear time
 

1653
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,990
and because these run in linear time
this also

1654
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
this also
 

1655
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,070
this also
runs into n times m so all of these

1656
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
runs into n times m so all of these
 

1657
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,549
runs into n times m so all of these
things are n times m and we're golden

1658
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
things are n times m and we're golden
 

1659
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:09,590
things are n times m and we're golden
any questions on this question yeah

1660
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600

 

1661
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,029

what sort of things would you be looking

1662
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
what sort of things would you be looking
 

1663
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,950
what sort of things would you be looking
for to make sure right so when i'm

1664
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
for to make sure right so when i'm
 

1665
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,669
for to make sure right so when i'm
writing down

1666
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
writing down
 

1667
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,789
writing down
i've i've described to you the algorithm

1668
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
i've i've described to you the algorithm
 

1669
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,149
i've i've described to you the algorithm
and uh so the question is what

1670
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
and uh so the question is what
 

1671
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,909
and uh so the question is what
kinds of things do i need to write down

1672
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:21,919
kinds of things do i need to write down
 

1673
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,269
kinds of things do i need to write down
when i'm proving

1674
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
when i'm proving
 

1675
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,190
when i'm proving

check out the size of your graph right

1684
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,480
check out the size of your graph right
 

1685
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,870
check out the size of your graph right
state to me what the size of your graph

1686
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
state to me what the size of your graph
 

1687
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,510
state to me what the size of your graph
is here

1688
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
is here
 

1689
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,149
is here
in this case it's order n times m and

1690
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:42,159
in this case it's order n times m and
 

1691
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:42,549
in this case it's order n times m and
then

1692
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559
then
 

1693
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,710
then
i state the what the running time is of

1694
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
i state the what the running time is of
 

1695
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,110
i state the what the running time is of
the algorithm that i have is

1696
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
the algorithm that i have is
 

1697
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,230
the algorithm that i have is
applied to that right and so because

1698
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
applied to that right and so because
 

1699
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,750
applied to that right and so because
uh full bfs runs in o of

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,110
uh full bfs runs in o of
v plus e time right

1702
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,120
v plus e time right
 

1703
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,430
v plus e time right
it's useful to actually write this down

1704
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
it's useful to actually write this down
 

1705
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,710
it's useful to actually write this down
even though

1706
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
even though
 

1707
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,029
even though
right it's not in the terms of our

original problem variables
 

1711
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,190

it's useful to write this down so that

1712
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,200
it's useful to write this down so that
 

1713
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,110
it's useful to write this down so that
if i mess up when plugging these

1714
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,120
if i mess up when plugging these
 

1715
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,549
if i mess up when plugging these

variables in
 

1717
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,750
variables in
uh that you know

1718
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:13,760
uh that you know
 

1719
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,590
uh that you know
you're showing your steps and so if you

1720
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
you're showing your steps and so if you
 

1721
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,669
you're showing your steps and so if you
mess up arithmetically

1722
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
mess up arithmetically
 

1723
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,909
mess up arithmetically
then we can still give you points but

1724
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:19,919
then we can still give you points but
 

1725
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,990
then we can still give you points but
because the size the number of vertices

1726
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
because the size the number of vertices
 

1727
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,149
because the size the number of vertices
in the graph is n times m the number of

1728
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:24,159
in the graph is n times m the number of
 

1729
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,909
in the graph is n times m the number of
edges is n times m

1730
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:25,919
edges is n times m
 

1731
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,590
edges is n times m
i add them together it's still order n

1732
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
i add them together it's still order n
 

1733
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,350
i add them together it's still order n
times m and that would be a sufficient

1734
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
times m and that would be a sufficient
 

1735
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,950
times m and that would be a sufficient
for an argument of running time

1736
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
for an argument of running time
 

1737
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,710
for an argument of running time
and then i was saying for correctness uh

1738
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:34,720
and then i was saying for correctness uh
 

1739
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,630
and then i was saying for correctness uh
most of this the correctness of this

00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:18,640
i made
 

1783
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,509
i made
okay that's that's really all it needs

1784
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:21,519
okay that's that's really all it needs
 

1785
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:21,990
okay that's that's really all it needs
but

1786
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,000
but
 

1787
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,590
but
i would like a connection between those

1788
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
i would like a connection between those
 

1789
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,470
i would like a connection between those
values okay

1790
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
values okay
 

1791
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,310
values okay
now why why would you be constructing

1792
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
now why why would you be constructing
 

1793
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,830
now why why would you be constructing
this graph and finding connected

1794
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
this graph and finding connected
 

1795
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,789
this graph and finding connected
components if that

1796
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:30,799
components if that
 

1797
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,830
components if that
if if you didn't uh if

1798
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
if if you didn't uh if
 

1799
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,350
if if you didn't uh if
that wasn't what your thought was uh

1800
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
that wasn't what your thought was uh
 

1801
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,269
that wasn't what your thought was uh
i don't know but it's real it's good

1802
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
i don't know but it's real it's good
 

1803
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,710
i don't know but it's real it's good
when you're communicating to make sure

1804
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,720
when you're communicating to make sure
 

1805
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,230
when you're communicating to make sure
that that's abundantly clear

1806
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
that that's abundantly clear
 

1807
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,430
that that's abundantly clear
that that's why this is uh i mean you

1808
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
that that's why this is uh i mean you
 

1809
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,990
that that's why this is uh i mean you
should be able

1810
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
should be able
 

1811
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,669
should be able
to argue why why these things are

1812
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
to argue why why these things are
 

1813
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,909
to argue why why these things are
uh that is a connected component you

1814
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
uh that is a connected component you
 

1815
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,350
uh that is a connected component you
could say something like

1816
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,360
could say something like
 

1817
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,950
could say something like
because anything reachable is in the

1818
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
because anything reachable is in the
 

1819
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,669
because anything reachable is in the
same blob or something like that right

1820
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:57,679
same blob or something like that right
 

1821
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,710
same blob or something like that right
okay so that's problem one

1822
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720

 

1823
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,509

we got these nice mechanical boards all

1824
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
we got these nice mechanical boards all
 

1825
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,070
we got these nice mechanical boards all
right

1826
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
right
 

1827
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,149
right
so that's problem one problem two is a

1828
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:08,159
so that's problem one problem two is a
 

1829
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,470
so that's problem one problem two is a
little funky

1830
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
little funky
 

1831
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,710
little funky
okay uh it's been reworded a little bit

1832
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
okay uh it's been reworded a little bit
 

1833
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,070
okay uh it's been reworded a little bit
from uh it's from spring 18

1834
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,080
from uh it's from spring 18
 

1835
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,750
from uh it's from spring 18
so that i could uh point out some other

1836
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
so that i could uh point out some other
 

1837
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,070
so that i could uh point out some other
features of this graph we're given a

1838
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
features of this graph we're given a
 

1839
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,029
features of this graph we're given a
connected

1840
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,039

right
 

1853
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,870
right
so they're mapping to the positive

1854
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
so they're mapping to the positive
 

1855
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,269
so they're mapping to the positive
integers where

1856
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
integers where
 

1857
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,830
integers where
e is the same size as v right so the

1858
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:43,840
e is the same size as v right so the
 

1859
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,110
e is the same size as v right so the
size of e is the same

1860
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
size of e is the same
 

1861
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,430
size of e is the same
size as the size of v right so i have

1862
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,440
size as the size of v right so i have
 

1863
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,789
size as the size of v right so i have
the same number of edges as i have

what's the what's the difficulty with

1938
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,280
what's the what's the difficulty with
 

1939
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,470
what's the what's the difficulty with
this algorithm slow

1940
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
this algorithm slow
 

1941
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,069
this algorithm slow
too slow right that algorithm would run

1942
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,079
too slow right that algorithm would run
 

1943
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,829
too slow right that algorithm would run
in o of v

1944
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839
in o of v
 

1945
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,109
in o of v
log v plus e and

1946
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,119
log v plus e and
 

1947
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,589
log v plus e and
in this case these are the same so this

1948
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:01,599
in this case these are the same so this
 

1949
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,150
in this case these are the same so this
is asymptotically smaller than this one

1950

is asymptotically smaller than this one
 

1951
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,109
is asymptotically smaller than this one
it runs in v log v so we're a little off

00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:09,119

 

1953
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,030

1955
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,030
we're off by a logarithmic factor in our
running time but you know this would at

1957
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,710

least be a correct algorithm

1958
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:14,720

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,150
single source shortest path algorithm
right

2008
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
right
 

2009
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,190
right
uh in particular using bfs

2010
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200
uh in particular using bfs
 

2011
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,349
uh in particular using bfs
we saw a transformation where if as long

00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:11,359
we saw a transformation where if as long
 

2013

we saw a transformation where if as long
as the sum of your weights was

linear in the combinatorial size of your
 

2017
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,190
linear in the combinatorial size of your
graph we could use bfs

2018
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
graph we could use bfs
 

2019
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,349
graph we could use bfs
by by making each edge a bunch of

2020
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
by by making each edge a bunch of
 

2021
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,390
by by making each edge a bunch of
undirected edges

2022
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
undirected edges
 

2023
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,390
undirected edges
we don't have that in this context and

2024
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,400
we don't have that in this context and
 

2025
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,150
we don't have that in this context and
this graph is undirected

2026
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,160
this graph is undirected
 

2027
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,470
this graph is undirected
i mean so it definitely contains cycles

2028
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,480
i mean so it definitely contains cycles
 

2029
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,630
i mean so it definitely contains cycles
so we can't use dag shortest paths

2030
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
so we can't use dag shortest paths
 

2031
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,230
so we can't use dag shortest paths
so how the heck can we do this

2032
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
so how the heck can we do this
 

2033
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,069
so how the heck can we do this
well what does this graph look like here

2034
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
well what does this graph look like here
 

2035
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,910
well what does this graph look like here
i'm going to take a look at this

2036
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:35,920
i'm going to take a look at this
 

2037
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,950
i'm going to take a look at this
condition

2038
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
condition
 

2039
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,550
condition
v equals e okay

2040
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,560
v equals e okay
 

2041
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,990
v equals e okay
so what does this graph look like it's

2042
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
so what does this graph look like it's
 

2043
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,589
so what does this graph look like it's
connected and it's v

2044
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:43,599
connected and it's v
 

2045
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,430
connected and it's v
plus e well how many edges

2046
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:47,440
plus e well how many edges
 

2047
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,230
plus e well how many edges
does a tree have

2048
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,240

 

2049
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,589

v minus one right

2050
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:55,599
v minus one right
 

2051
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,950
v minus one right
so in a sense if a tree

2052
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:58,960
so in a sense if a tree
 

2053
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,829
so in a sense if a tree
is the is the smallest number of edges

2054
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:01,839
is the is the smallest number of edges
 

2055
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,510
is the is the smallest number of edges
you can have in a connected graph

2056
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,520

 

2057
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,150

so this has one more edge than a tree

2058
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,160
so this has one more edge than a tree
 

2059
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,230
so this has one more edge than a tree
right so really what this looks like

2060
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,240
right so really what this looks like
 

2061
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,390
right so really what this looks like
what our graph g looks like is some kind

2062
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,400
what our graph g looks like is some kind
 

2063
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,630
what our graph g looks like is some kind
of tree

2064
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
of tree
 

2065
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,670
of tree
and somewhere we've got

2066
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:17,680
and somewhere we've got
 

2067
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,670
and somewhere we've got
an extra edge

2068
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680

 

2069
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,030

in this graph right it's a tree plus an

2070
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,040
in this graph right it's a tree plus an
 

2071
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,430
in this graph right it's a tree plus an
extra edge that's what our graph is

2072
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,440
extra edge that's what our graph is
 

2073
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,550
extra edge that's what our graph is
okay so

2074
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:30,560
okay so
 

2075
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,630
okay so
well let's take a step back if i just

2076
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:32,640
well let's take a step back if i just
 

2077
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,870
well let's take a step back if i just
had a tree

2078
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:34,880
had a tree
 

2079
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,030
had a tree
and i had weighed a weighted graph here

2080
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,040
and i had weighed a weighted graph here
 

2081
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,950
and i had weighed a weighted graph here
undirected

2082
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
undirected
 

2083
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,990
undirected
and the weights are all positive

2084
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,000

 

2085
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,310

if if any of the weights were negative

2086
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,320
if if any of the weights were negative
 

2087
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,829
if if any of the weights were negative
how could i solve this problem

2088
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:47,839
how could i solve this problem
 

2089
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,310
how could i solve this problem
well every edge is reachable from every

2090
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,320
well every edge is reachable from every
 

2091
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,950
well every edge is reachable from every
vertex

2092
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960
vertex
 

2093
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,870
vertex
i can just go to that edge and traverse

2094
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:52,880
i can just go to that edge and traverse
 

2095
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,030
i can just go to that edge and traverse
a negative weight back and forth and

2096
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
a negative weight back and forth and
 

2097
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,310
a negative weight back and forth and
my shortest pathway would be uh

2098
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,320
my shortest pathway would be uh
 

2099
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,390
my shortest pathway would be uh
infinite for all our vertices that's not

2100
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:00,400
infinite for all our vertices that's not
 

2101
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,670
infinite for all our vertices that's not
the case we have here

2102
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
the case we have here
 

2103
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,910
the case we have here
we have positive edge weights only which

2104
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:03,920
we have positive edge weights only which
 

2105
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,710
we have positive edge weights only which
means

2106
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,720
means
 

2107
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,950
means
shortest paths are simple and actually

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,710
shortest paths are simple and actually
there's only one

there's only one
 

2111
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,190
there's only one
simple path between any pair of vertices

2112
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,200
simple path between any pair of vertices
 

2113
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,630
simple path between any pair of vertices
in a tree

00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:12,640
in a tree
 

2115
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,829
in a tree
right i basically there's

00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839
right i basically there's
 

2117
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,310
right i basically there's
there's one thing i can do and in fact

there's one thing i can do and in fact
 

2119
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,030
there's one thing i can do and in fact
if i took

2120
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,040
if i took
 

2121
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,630
if i took
if this was s and this was t

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:22,640
if this was s and this was t
 

2123
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,430
if this was s and this was t
t that's that's an x what am i doing

2124
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:25,440
t that's that's an x what am i doing
 

2125
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:25,750
t that's that's an x what am i doing
okay

2126
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:25,760
okay
 

2127
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,349
okay
t if i just ran

2128
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359

reachability algorithm i would get a a

2132
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
reachability algorithm i would get a a
 

2133
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:35,990
reachability algorithm i would get a a
tree

2134
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
tree
 

2135
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,950
tree
right a bfs tree or a dfs tree right it

2136
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:38,960
right a bfs tree or a dfs tree right it
 

2137
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,030
right a bfs tree or a dfs tree right it
would visit vertices in some order

2138
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
would visit vertices in some order
 

2139
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,910
would visit vertices in some order
now actually in a tree it i have to

2140
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:43,920
now actually in a tree it i have to
 

2141
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,430
now actually in a tree it i have to
output a tree that connects all the

2142
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,440
output a tree that connects all the
 

2143
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,790
output a tree that connects all the
vertices

2144
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:46,800
vertices
 

2145
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,870
vertices
right and that would be this tree

2146
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:50,880
right and that would be this tree
 

2147
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,710
right and that would be this tree
right and so in a sense the paths that i

2148
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
right and so in a sense the paths that i
 

2149
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,670
right and so in a sense the paths that i
got

2150
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
got
 

2151
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,550
got
from bfs or dfs in this graph would be

2152
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,560
from bfs or dfs in this graph would be
 

2153
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,109
from bfs or dfs in this graph would be
exactly

2154
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119
exactly
 

2155
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,710
exactly
shortest paths i would just have to then

2156
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720
shortest paths i would just have to then
 

2157
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,790
shortest paths i would just have to then
go and add up all the pa

2158
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:02,800
go and add up all the pa
 

2159
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,310
go and add up all the pa
path edge weights along the edges

2160
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:06,320
path edge weights along the edges
 

2161
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,069
path edge weights along the edges
that make sense okay so

2162
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
that make sense okay so
 

2163
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:16,150
that make sense okay so
uh bfs or dfs in the unweighted context

2164
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
uh bfs or dfs in the unweighted context
 

2165
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,310
uh bfs or dfs in the unweighted context
can give me the shortest path in the

2166
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:18,320
can give me the shortest path in the
 

2167
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,829
can give me the shortest path in the
weighted context

2168
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
weighted context
 

2169
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,069
weighted context
because there's only one simple path in

2170
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
because there's only one simple path in
 

2171
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,829
because there's only one simple path in
this graph but we have a complication

2172
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:23,839
this graph but we have a complication
 

2173
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:24,230
this graph but we have a complication
here

2174
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
here
 

2175
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,430
here
that's not the question that we're

2176
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
that's not the question that we're
 

2177
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,430
that's not the question that we're
asking we have an extra edge

2178
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
asking we have an extra edge
 

2179
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,870
asking we have an extra edge
and now we have a property where there's

2180
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
and now we have a property where there's
 

2181
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,750
and now we have a property where there's
not just one

2182
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760
not just one
 

2183
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,790
not just one
simple path to t there could be two

2184
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:36,800
simple path to t there could be two
 

2185
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,910
simple path to t there could be two
simple paths

2186
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
simple paths
 

2187
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,069
simple paths
right i could go this way around the

2188
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:40,079
right i could go this way around the
 

2189
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:40,950
right i could go this way around the
cycle

2190
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:40,960
cycle
 

2191
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,230
cycle
or it could go this way around the cycle

2192
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,240

 

2193
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,310

so that's a complication but there's

2194
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:48,320
so that's a complication but there's
 

2195
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,550
so that's a complication but there's
only one cycle

2196
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560

 

2197
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,829

if t is over here there's only one path

2198
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
if t is over here there's only one path
 

2199
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,990
if t is over here there's only one path
right so if there there is only one path

2200
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,000
right so if there there is only one path
 

2201
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,829
right so if there there is only one path
i'll be golden but if basically the

2202
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
i'll be golden but if basically the
 

2203
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,589
i'll be golden but if basically the
cycle can be reached between these two

2204
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:05,599
cycle can be reached between these two
 

2205
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:05,990
cycle can be reached between these two
things

2206
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,000
things
 

2207
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,990
things
i could have two simple paths that's the

2208
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,000
i could have two simple paths that's the
 

2209
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,349
i could have two simple paths that's the
property right we have

2210
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,359
property right we have
 

2211
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,910
property right we have
the closest vertex on so this is the

2212
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
the closest vertex on so this is the
 

2213
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,349
the closest vertex on so this is the
cycle

2214
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:13,359
cycle
 

2215
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,870
cycle
right there's a cycle here

2216
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:16,880
right there's a cycle here
 

2217
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,710
right there's a cycle here
if this is the closest vertex to s

2218
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:20,720
if this is the closest vertex to s
 

2219
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,790
if this is the closest vertex to s
and this is the closest vertex to t on

2220
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
and this is the closest vertex to t on
 

2221
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,870
and this is the closest vertex to t on
the cycle then i could take either path

2222
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
the cycle then i could take either path
 

2223
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,150
the cycle then i could take either path
around the cycle

2224
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,160
around the cycle
 

2225
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,309
around the cycle
to get from one to the other and that

2226
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:28,319
to get from one to the other and that
 

2227
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,950
to get from one to the other and that
gives me my two paths

2228
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:32,960

 

2229
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,550

but this path and this path

2230
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
but this path and this path
 

2231
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,950
but this path and this path
right these are completely edge disjoint

2232
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:38,960
right these are completely edge disjoint
 

2233
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,309
right these are completely edge disjoint
right

2234
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:40,319
right
 

2235
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,430
right
in other words any simple path from s to

2236
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,440
in other words any simple path from s to
 

2237
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,550
in other words any simple path from s to
t

2238
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:44,560
t
 

2239
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,870
t
if i if i find this vertex going through

2240
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:46,880
if i if i find this vertex going through
 

2241
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,390
if i if i find this vertex going through
here

2242
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
here
 

2243
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,230
here
it can only use one of these edges

2244
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,240
it can only use one of these edges
 

2245
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,710
it can only use one of these edges
right because i can't i can't come back

2246
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
right because i can't i can't come back
 

2247
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,670
right because i can't i can't come back
to this vertex

2248
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
to this vertex
 

2249
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,230
to this vertex
once i go into it here i got to go out

2250
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
once i go into it here i got to go out
 

2251
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,550
once i go into it here i got to go out
one direction and i can't come back

2252
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,560
one direction and i can't come back
 

2253
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,550
one direction and i can't come back
right so it's only one of these two

2254
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
right so it's only one of these two
 

2255
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,589
right so it's only one of these two
edges

2256
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:03,599
edges
 

2257
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,230
edges
so the the idea behind this algorithm is

2258
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,240
so the the idea behind this algorithm is
 

2259
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,470
so the the idea behind this algorithm is
i'm going to find the cycle

2260
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
i'm going to find the cycle
 

2261
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,710
i'm going to find the cycle
or in particular i'm going to find this

2262
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:10,720
or in particular i'm going to find this
 

2263
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,150
or in particular i'm going to find this
thing s prime

2264
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,160

2265
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,750
thing s prime
on the cycle find the

2266
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:15,760
on the cycle find the
 

2267
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,030
on the cycle find the
outgoing two edges here remove

2268
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,040
outgoing two edges here remove
 

2269
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,030
outgoing two edges here remove
one and then do my tree searching

2270
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
one and then do my tree searching
 

2271
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,030
one and then do my tree searching
basically find the shortest path by by

2272
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
basically find the shortest path by by
 

2273
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,150
basically find the shortest path by by
running a an

2274
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160
running a an

the only simple path in that tree right
 

2283
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,870
the only simple path in that tree right
i get rid of this

2284
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:34,880
i get rid of this
 

2285
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,750
i get rid of this
this edge and i do that once and i do it

2286
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,760
this edge and i do that once and i do it
 

2287
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,390

00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,560
without this edge so that's that's the
 

2291

to find
 

2297
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,710
to find

edge of my graph will not be in my tree

2312
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119

 

2313
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,510

something like here right the shortest

00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:11,520
something like here right the shortest
 

2315
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,390

algorithm idea two

2320
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,000

 

2321
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,190

two first find

00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,160
edge is not in my tree of the graph
 

2341
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,309
edge is not in my tree of the graph
that will exist on the cycle kind of by

2345
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,190

it's cons it's connecting two part parts

2346
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
it's cons it's connecting two part parts
 

2347
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,550
it's cons it's connecting two part parts
of my tree

2348
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:08,560

 

2349
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,309

now i can look at those two paths

2350
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
now i can look at those two paths
 

2351
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,030
now i can look at those two paths
from here and the last one that they're

2352
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,040
from here and the last one that they're
 

2353
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,630
from here and the last one that they're
in common from s

2354
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:16,640
in common from s
 

2355
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,390
in common from s
is going to be my split point s prime

2356
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
is going to be my split point s prime
 

2357
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,430
is going to be my split point s prime
it's the it's the closest one

2358
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
it's the it's the closest one
 

2359
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,910
it's the it's the closest one
to my source that is on the cycle right

2360
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:25,920
to my source that is on the cycle right
 

2361
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,550
to my source that is on the cycle right
because i constructed this cycle here

2362
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:28,560
because i constructed this cycle here
 

2363
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,589
because i constructed this cycle here
okay so i can uh

2364
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599
okay so i can uh
 

2365
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,910
okay so i can uh
find edge

2366
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:37,920
find edge
 

2367
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,270
find edge
u v not in

00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
u v not in
 

2369
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,790
u v not in
the parent tree right so

2370
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:44,800
the parent tree right so
 

2371
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,470
the parent tree right so
maybe this is u v right

2372
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:48,480
maybe this is u v right
 

2373
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,150
maybe this is u v right
not in the parent tree

2374
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,160

 

2375
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,710

and then find

2376
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:56,720
and then find
 

2377
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,349
and then find
last common

2378
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:01,359

okay and i can do that by i mean these

2390
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:20,720
okay and i can do that by i mean these
 

2391
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,589
okay and i can do that by i mean these
are each

2392
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
are each
 

2393
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,390
are each
of linear size and i can just look at

2394
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:24,400
of linear size and i can just look at
 

2395
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,069

00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
i can walk forward until they diverge
 

2399
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,910
i can walk forward until they diverge
and the one before they diverge is s

2400
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
and the one before they diverge is s
 

2401
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,950
and the one before they diverge is s

right that's s prime right here once i

2404
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:35,520
right that's s prime right here once i
 

2405
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,950
right that's s prime right here once i
have s prime

2406
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:36,960
have s prime
 

2407
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,349
have s prime
i know what the edges are when they

2408
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359
i know what the edges are when they
 

2409
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,950
i know what the edges are when they

i remove one of those from the graph i

2412
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:44,000
i remove one of those from the graph i
 

2413
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,750
i remove one of those from the graph i
do the same algorithm again to find a

2414
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
do the same algorithm again to find a
 

2415
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,190
do the same algorithm again to find a
path to t

2416
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,200
path to t
 

2417
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,870
path to t
and i do the same algorithm again to

2418
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
and i do the same algorithm again to
 

2419
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,829
and i do the same algorithm again to
find the path to t

2420
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839
find the path to t
 

2421
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,309
find the path to t
and i see which one is shorter that's it

2422
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
and i see which one is shorter that's it
 

2423
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,589
and i see which one is shorter that's it
there's only two of them

2424
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:55,599
there's only two of them
 

2425
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,829
there's only two of them
and so i check or they could be the same

2426
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:57,839
and so i check or they could be the same
 

2427
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,990
and so i check or they could be the same
path in which case

2428
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
path in which case
 

2429
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,430
path in which case
uh my my t

2435
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,190

does that make sense so that's that's

2436
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,200
does that make sense so that's that's
 

2437
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,150
does that make sense so that's that's
the idea

00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,160
the idea
 

2439
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,510
the idea
uh the last thing is

uh the last thing is
 

2441
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,030
uh the last thing is
remove an

that's the claim
okay and this runs in uh

2484
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:23,359
okay and this runs in uh
 

2485
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,349
okay and this runs in uh
linear time because what i'm doing is

on a graph that has size v right
 

2497
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,430
on a graph that has size v right
and this prefix finding also only takes

2498
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,440
and this prefix finding also only takes
 

2499
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,910

00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,270
what's up there's a yeah there's a hint
in the title actually

2510
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,280
in the title actually
 

2511
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,270
in the title actually
the original version of this problem

2512
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:07,280
the original version of this problem
 

2513
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,270
the original version of this problem
said instead of this e

2514
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
said instead of this e
 

2515
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,109
said instead of this e
equals v specification it said there's

2516
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:11,119
equals v specification it said there's
 

2517
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,750
equals v specification it said there's
only one cycle in the graph

2518
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:13,760
only one cycle in the graph
 

2519
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,470
only one cycle in the graph
but it's in the context of undirected

2520
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:16,480
but it's in the context of undirected
 

2521
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,950
but it's in the context of undirected
cycles as opposed to directed cycles

2522
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:18,960
cycles as opposed to directed cycles
 

2523
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,390
cycles as opposed to directed cycles
which is usually what we talk about in

2524
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
which is usually what we talk about in
 

2525
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,349
which is usually what we talk about in
this class

2526
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,359
this class
 

2527
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,030
this class
right we say that there's a negative

2528
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,040
right we say that there's a negative
 

2529
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,390
right we say that there's a negative
edge weight cycle

2530
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:24,400
edge weight cycle
 

2531
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,349
edge weight cycle
in the graph if we can you know it's

2532
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
in the graph if we can you know it's
 

2533
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:27,990
in the graph if we can you know it's
usually we're

2534
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,000
usually we're
 

2535
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,230
usually we're
talking about we're allowing non-simple

2536
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,240
talking about we're allowing non-simple
 

2537

sicklicity i changed the condition uh
 

2551
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,230
sicklicity i changed the condition uh
for this

2552
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,240
for this
 

2553
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,589
for this
problem session this review yeah

2554
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
problem session this review yeah
 

2555
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,829
problem session this review yeah
could i also just run depth first search

2556
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:51,839
could i also just run depth first search
 

2557
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,430
could i also just run depth first search
on this graph

2558
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:53,440
on this graph
 

2559
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,109
on this graph
could you just run depth first search on

2560
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119
could you just run depth first search on
 

2561
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,349
could you just run depth first search on
this graph to do what

2562
00:47:59,349 --> 00:47:59,359

 

2563
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,589

to find the shortest path right so depth

2564
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
to find the shortest path right so depth
 

2565
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,470
to find the shortest path right so depth
first search on this path

2566
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
first search on this path
 

2567
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,910
first search on this path
if i ran it from s when i got to s prime

2568
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:07,920
if i ran it from s when i got to s prime
 

2569
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,589
if i ran it from s when i got to s prime
i would have a choice on what the next

2570
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:09,599
i would have a choice on what the next
 

2571
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,950
i would have a choice on what the next
outgoing edge to do

2572
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,960
outgoing edge to do
 

2573
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,870
outgoing edge to do
right so if i ran depth first choice for

2574
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
right so if i ran depth first choice for
 

2575
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,549
right so if i ran depth first choice for
one of those choices

2576
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
one of those choices
 

2577
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,589
one of those choices
i would find a path to t right

2578
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
i would find a path to t right
 

2579
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,670
i would find a path to t right
and then i would find then then i could

2580
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
and then i would find then then i could
 

2581
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,990
and then i would find then then i could
run and i would find a path to t

2582
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
run and i would find a path to t
 

2583
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,870
run and i would find a path to t
right there's only two of them or at

2584
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:28,880
right there's only two of them or at
 

2585
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,750
right there's only two of them or at
most two of them

2586
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:29,760
most two of them
 

2587
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,030
most two of them
but then there's the possibility i

2588
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:31,040
but then there's the possibility i
 

2589
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,829
but then there's the possibility i
missed this other path that could be

2590
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:32,839
missed this other path that could be
 

2591
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,430
missed this other path that could be
shorter well how would i miss it

2592
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:35,440
shorter well how would i miss it
 

2593
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,109
shorter well how would i miss it
has to go through the other edge too it

2594
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:37,119
has to go through the other edge too it
 

2595
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,470
has to go through the other edge too it
doesn't go through the other edge that's

2596
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:38,480
doesn't go through the other edge that's
 

2597
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,910
doesn't go through the other edge that's
the point

2598
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:39,920
the point
 

2599
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,150
the point
right um it won't go through

2600
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
right um it won't go through
 

2601
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,470
right um it won't go through
no so depth first search will actually

2602
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:46,480
no so depth first search will actually
 

2603
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,750
no so depth first search will actually
go through this thing

2604
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:47,760
go through this thing
 

2605
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,309
go through this thing
traverse an edge go all the way around

2606
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:50,319
traverse an edge go all the way around
 

2607
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,109
traverse an edge go all the way around
the cycle

2608
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:51,119
the cycle
 

2609
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,190
the cycle
because everything here is reachable

2610
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,200
because everything here is reachable
 

2611
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,030
because everything here is reachable
from here because it's an undirected

2612
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
from here because it's an undirected
 

2613
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,990
from here because it's an undirected
graph

2614
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,000
graph
 

2615
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,670
graph
it will reach back to here and then

2616
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:57,680
it will reach back to here and then
 

2617
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,670
it will reach back to here and then
backtrack all the way so we'll actually

2618
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,680
backtrack all the way so we'll actually
 

2619
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,549
backtrack all the way so we'll actually
never traverse this last edge here of

2620
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
never traverse this last edge here of
 

2621
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,990
never traverse this last edge here of
the cycle

2622
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:04,000
the cycle
 

2623
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,270
the cycle
so it's something you can actually prove

2624
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
so it's something you can actually prove
 

2625
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,510
so it's something you can actually prove
with dfs now you could actually

2626
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:07,520
with dfs now you could actually
 

2627
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,910
with dfs now you could actually
while you're running dfs try every

2628
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:09,920
while you're running dfs try every
 

2629
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,109
while you're running dfs try every
possibility right

2630
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:11,119
possibility right
 

2631
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,870
possibility right
because my branching factors at most

2632
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
because my branching factors at most
 

2633
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,790
because my branching factors at most
three at some of these things right

2634
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:16,800
three at some of these things right
 

2635
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,990
three at some of these things right
so what i i could do is uh

2636
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,000
so what i i could do is uh
 

2637
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,030
so what i i could do is uh
or it could be at most four right i

2638
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
or it could be at most four right i
 

2639
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,910
or it could be at most four right i
could i could

2640
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:23,920
could i could
 

2641
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,069
could i could
connect two things with the same uh

2642
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:26,079
connect two things with the same uh
 

2643
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,069
connect two things with the same uh
branching but in general it's a constant

2644
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
branching but in general it's a constant
 

2645
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:28,309
branching but in general it's a constant
and

2646
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:28,319
and
 

2647
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,349
and
and with with every choice dfs

2648
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
and with with every choice dfs
 

2649
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,829
and with with every choice dfs
could make i could try all possibilities

2650
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
could make i could try all possibilities
 

2651
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,390
could make i could try all possibilities
how many possibilities would that be

2652
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,400

 

2653
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,670

you get a blow up of the degree of

2654
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
you get a blow up of the degree of
 

2655
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,870
you get a blow up of the degree of
every vertex in my graph

2656
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
every vertex in my graph
 

2657
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,790
every vertex in my graph
so the degree

2658
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:48,800
so the degree
 

2659
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,630
so the degree
time multiplied by each other that's the

2660
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
time multiplied by each other that's the
 

2661
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,190
time multiplied by each other that's the
number of times i would have to run dfs

2662
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,200
number of times i would have to run dfs
 

2663
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,829
number of times i would have to run dfs
which is exponential right a constant

2664
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:56,839
which is exponential right a constant
 

2665
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,470
which is exponential right a constant
degree

2666
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:58,480
degree
 

2667
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,210
degree
so a constant uh

2668
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:00,220
so a constant uh
 

2669
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,910
so a constant uh

multiplied like like two or

2672
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:05,359
multiplied like like two or
 

2673
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,549
multiplied like like two or
three right uh multiplied v

three right uh multiplied v
times is three to the v which is

2676
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
times is three to the v which is
 

2677
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,309
times is three to the v which is

so usually i think if if i were writing

2784
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:30,240
so usually i think if if i were writing
 

2785
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,910
so usually i think if if i were writing
this problem now i'd probably be a

00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:31,920
this problem now i'd probably be a
 

2787
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,109
this problem now i'd probably be a
little bit more explicit

2788
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
little bit more explicit
 

2789
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,270
little bit more explicit
the distance is positive but that's you

2790
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:35,280
the distance is positive but that's you
 

2791
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,950
the distance is positive but that's you
know something that you might

2792
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:36,960
know something that you might
 

2793
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,750
know something that you might
come into contact with right distances

2794
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:39,760
come into contact with right distances
 

2795
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,150
come into contact with right distances
are

2796
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,160
are
 

2797
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,750
are
positive right and so we can't have

2798
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:41,760
positive right and so we can't have
 

2799
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,190
positive right and so we can't have
negative distances here

2800
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,200
negative distances here
 

2801
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,230
negative distances here
okay uh so

2802
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
okay uh so
 

2803
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,349
okay uh so
i look at n log n i'm like hey

2804
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:49,359
i look at n log n i'm like hey
 

2805
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,510
i look at n log n i'm like hey
what has a log in it in this unit

maybe i can use dijkstra okay so let's

2810
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:54,640
maybe i can use dijkstra okay so let's
 

2811
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,109
maybe i can use dijkstra okay so let's
see if if we ran dijkstra

2812
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:57,119
see if if we ran dijkstra
 

2813
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,190
see if if we ran dijkstra
from p to h okay so we've got we've got

2814
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
from p to h okay so we've got we've got
 

2815
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,670
from p to h okay so we've got we've got
a graph here

2816
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:01,680
a graph here
 

2817
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,109
a graph here
we've got our graph so

2818
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
we've got our graph so
 

2819
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,069
we've got our graph so
i'm this is a word problem so there's no

2820
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:08,079
i'm this is a word problem so there's no
 

2821
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:08,950
i'm this is a word problem so there's no

2822
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:08,960
graph there
 

2823
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,230
graph there
so i have to define a graph okay so i'm

2824
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
so i have to define a graph okay so i'm
 

2825
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,510
so i have to define a graph okay so i'm
going to define a graph

2826
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:15,520
going to define a graph
 

2827
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,870
going to define a graph
v e and we've got v

2828
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
v e and we've got v
 

2829
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,510
v e and we've got v
that's going to be my set of locations

2830
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:24,520

 

2831
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,990

locations so this has

2832
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
locations so this has
 

2833
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,829

2835
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,430
their order n of them there's actually n
n of them and then e

2836
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:35,440
n of them and then e
 

2837
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,549
n of them and then e
what are we going to have we're going to

2838
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:36,559
what are we going to have we're going to

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,870
what are we going to have we're going to
have

2840
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880

 

2841
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,190

uh it's a known pair of things right

2842
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:45,200
uh it's a known pair of things right
 

2843
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,790
uh it's a known pair of things right
road roads

2844
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:48,800
road roads
 

2845
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,069
road roads
with weight

2846
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079

equal to driving

2848
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:55,359
equal to driving
 

2849
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:01,190
equal to driving
driving drive

2850
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,200

 

2851
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,910

driving distance

2852
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
driving distance
 

2853
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,549
driving distance
which uh by my assumption is going to be

2854
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:08,559
which uh by my assumption is going to be
 

2855
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:09,990
which uh by my assumption is going to be
greater than zero

2856
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,000
greater than zero
 

2857
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,270
greater than zero
right now it's not stated explicitly but

2858
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,280
right now it's not stated explicitly but
 

2859
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,390
right now it's not stated explicitly but
you know that would be a reasonable

2860
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:14,400
you know that would be a reasonable
 

2861
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,950
you know that would be a reasonable
assumption for you to make on your exam

2862
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:16,960
assumption for you to make on your exam
 

2863
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,349
assumption for you to make on your exam
because distances are positive we would

2864
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:19,359
because distances are positive we would
 

2865
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,870
because distances are positive we would
probably be more

2866
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
probably be more
 

2867
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,910
probably be more
explicit about that these days okay all

2868
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:23,920
explicit about that these days okay all
 

2869
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,390
explicit about that these days okay all
right

2870
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:24,400
right
 

2871
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,430
right
so this is a graph i could make and i

2872
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,440
so this is a graph i could make and i
 

2873
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,069
so this is a graph i could make and i
have a

2874
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,079
have a
 

2875
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,750
have a
vertex s or a vertex p

2876
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:31,760
vertex s or a vertex p
 

2877
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,190
vertex s or a vertex p
and a vertex h and i'm trying to find a

2878
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
and a vertex h and i'm trying to find a
 

2879
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,390
and a vertex h and i'm trying to find a
shortest path between them

2880
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:36,400
shortest path between them
 

2881
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,750
shortest path between them
right shortest driving distance driving

2882
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:39,760
right shortest driving distance driving
 

2883
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,230
right shortest driving distance driving
route

2884
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:40,240
route
 

2885
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,309
route
right okay so i could run dijkstra

2886
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:44,319
right okay so i could run dijkstra
 

2887
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,549
right okay so i could run dijkstra
wait so what do i know about this how

2888
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:46,559
wait so what do i know about this how
 

2889
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:47,990
wait so what do i know about this how
many edges do i have my graph

2890
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
many edges do i have my graph
 

2891
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,349
many edges do i have my graph
i have at most five per vertex

2892
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359
i have at most five per vertex
 

2893
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,549
i have at most five per vertex
right so this is upper bounded by five

2894
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
right so this is upper bounded by five
 

2895
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,549
right so this is upper bounded by five
times v

2896
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:56,559
times v
 

2897
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,589
times v
which is order v okay so i have a order

2898
00:54:59,589 --> 00:54:59,599
which is order v okay so i have a order
 

2899
00:54:59,599 --> 00:54:59,829
which is order v okay so i have a order
v

2900
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
v
 

2901
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,430
v
size graph that's a good thing order n

2902
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,440
size graph that's a good thing order n
 

2903
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,470
size graph that's a good thing order n
because n is the number of vertices and

2904
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:06,480
because n is the number of vertices and
 

2905
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,510
because n is the number of vertices and
so

2906
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:07,520
so
 

2907
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,150
so
if i were to just run dijkstra on here

2908
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
if i were to just run dijkstra on here
 

2909
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,589
if i were to just run dijkstra on here
from p

2910
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:13,599

 

2911
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,950

doing dijkstra

2912
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960

 

2913
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,710

on g from

2914
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
on g from
 

2915
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,309
on g from
any s takes

2916
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319

 

2917
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,470

order n log n right

2918
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
order n log n right
 

2919
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,829
order n log n right
n log n plus n and n log n is bigger

2920
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:35,839
n log n plus n and n log n is bigger
 

2921
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:36,390
n log n plus n and n log n is bigger
than n

2922
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:36,400
than n
 

2923
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,270
than n
okay so that's that's a nice observation

2924
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,280
okay so that's that's a nice observation
 

2925
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,829
okay so that's that's a nice observation
we may be

2926
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:39,839
we may be
 

2927
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,589
we may be
we have we can at least afford to use

2928
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
we have we can at least afford to use
 

2929
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,870
we have we can at least afford to use
dijkstra in this problem to find

2930
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:42,880
dijkstra in this problem to find
 

2931
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,829
dijkstra in this problem to find
shortest distances

2932
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:43,839
shortest distances
 

2933
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,910
shortest distances
but what's the problem with a shortest

2934
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:45,920
but what's the problem with a shortest
 

2935
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,270
but what's the problem with a shortest
distance found by dijkstra in this graph

2936
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
distance found by dijkstra in this graph
 

2937
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,030
distance found by dijkstra in this graph
donuts like the entire point of the

2938
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,040
donuts like the entire point of the
 

2939
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,870
donuts like the entire point of the
problem right

2940
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
problem right
 

2941
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,349
problem right
i need to avoid being too close to donut

2942
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:55,359
i need to avoid being too close to donut
 

2943
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,789
i need to avoid being too close to donut
shops

2944
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:56,799
shops
 

2945
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,990
shops
okay so we might have a donut shop

2946
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,000
okay so we might have a donut shop
 

2947
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,190
okay so we might have a donut shop
here and we need to stay outside of that

2948
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:03,200
here and we need to stay outside of that
 

2949
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,230
here and we need to stay outside of that
distance k

2950
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:04,240
distance k
 

2951
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,910
distance k
right or we might have another donut

2952
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
right or we might have another donut
 

2953
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,270
right or we might have another donut
shop here

2954
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
shop here
 

2955
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,190
shop here
right and so we got to find a path that

2956
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
right and so we got to find a path that
 

2957
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,910
right and so we got to find a path that
kind of goes around these donut shops

2958
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:11,920
kind of goes around these donut shops
 

2959
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,950
kind of goes around these donut shops
okay so in other words if

2960
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:14,960
okay so in other words if
 

2961
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,589
okay so in other words if
if i have a vertex in my graph where i

2962
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
if i have a vertex in my graph where i
 

2963
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,750
if i have a vertex in my graph where i
can reach a doughnut shot within

2964
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:19,760
can reach a doughnut shot within
 

2965
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,950
can reach a doughnut shot within
shop within distance k i got i can never

2966
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
shop within distance k i got i can never
 

2967
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,470
shop within distance k i got i can never
visit that vertex

2968
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
visit that vertex
 

2969
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,069
visit that vertex
right because then i you know

2970
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
right because then i you know
 

2971
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,390
right because then i you know
momer will not be able to resist himself

2972
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:30,400
momer will not be able to resist himself
 

2973
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,990
momer will not be able to resist himself
and have to go eat a donut

2974
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,000
and have to go eat a donut
 

2975
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,990
and have to go eat a donut
okay so that's the thing we're trying to

2976
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
okay so that's the thing we're trying to
 

2977
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,630
okay so that's the thing we're trying to
avoid

2978
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640

 

2979
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,430

so how can we do this well here's a

2980
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
so how can we do this well here's a
 

2981
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,789
so how can we do this well here's a
silly thing

2982
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:40,799
silly thing
 

2983
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,950
silly thing
i could run dijkstra from each of these

2984
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
i could run dijkstra from each of these
 

2985
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,230
i could run dijkstra from each of these
vertices

2986
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,240
vertices
 

2987
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,789
vertices
these donut shops find all the things

2988
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
these donut shops find all the things
 

2989
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,829
these donut shops find all the things
reachable in k

2990
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:47,839
reachable in k
 

2991
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,190
reachable in k
driving distance from them

2992
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:51,200
driving distance from them
 

2993
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,190
driving distance from them
right and then remove those vertices

2994
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
right and then remove those vertices
 

2995
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,390
right and then remove those vertices
from the graph

2996
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:56,400
from the graph
 

2997
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,710
from the graph
that's an idea but how long would that

2998
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:58,720
that's an idea but how long would that
 

2999
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,230
that's an idea but how long would that
take that would mean

3000
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240
take that would mean
 

3001
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,750
take that would mean
need me to run dijkstra d times

3002
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:03,760
need me to run dijkstra d times
 

3003
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,829
need me to run dijkstra d times
right because there's d doughnut chops i

right because there's d doughnut chops i
gotta run dijkstra d

3006
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:06,880
gotta run dijkstra d
 

3007
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,549
gotta run dijkstra d
times so that gives me a running time

3008
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:08,559
times so that gives me a running time
 

3009
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,230
times so that gives me a running time
bound of i run d

3010
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
bound of i run d
 

3011
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,710
bound of i run d
times to filter out the graph right to

3012
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:12,720
times to filter out the graph right to
 

3013
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,150
times to filter out the graph right to
modify this graph

3014
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,160
modify this graph
 

3015
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,750
modify this graph
and then i do one more to find the

3016
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:15,760
and then i do one more to find the
 

3017
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,870
and then i do one more to find the
shortest path if there is one

3018
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:18,880
shortest path if there is one
 

3019
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,630
shortest path if there is one
but in general that's going to take d

3020
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640
but in general that's going to take d
 

3021
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,309
but in general that's going to take d
times n log n

3022
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:22,319
times n log n
 

3023
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,789
times n log n
not n log n i i have no bound on d

3024
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:24,799
not n log n i i have no bound on d
 

3025
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,630
not n log n i i have no bound on d
except that it's under n

3026
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
except that it's under n
 

3027
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,549
except that it's under n
right so it could be n and that would

3028
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
right so it could be n and that would
 

3029
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,829
right so it could be n and that would
give me a bad running time

3030
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:29,839
give me a bad running time
 

3031
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,230
give me a bad running time
so we're going to use a very similar

3032
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:32,240
so we're going to use a very similar
 

3033
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,589
so we're going to use a very similar

okay if i have all of these donut shops
 

3059
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,710
okay if i have all of these donut shops
what i can do is provide a

undirected edges
 

3065
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,190
undirected edges
right here we can model all of those

3066
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
right here we can model all of those
 

3067
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,870
right here we can model all of those
directed things by

00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,710
directed things by
two undirected edges it doesn't really

two undirected edges it doesn't really
 

3071
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,069
two undirected edges it doesn't really
matter but here

you know i don't want to go be able to
go back to my super node

3077
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,270

okay but what i'm going to do is i'm

okay but what i'm going to do is i'm
going to add a super node

going to add a super node
 

3081

right and then if i ran dykstra

3086
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:38,720
right and then if i ran dykstra
 

3087
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,910
right and then if i ran dykstra
from the super node

3088
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:41,920
from the super node
 

3089
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,670
from the super node
and found all vertices reachable within

3090
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,680
and found all vertices reachable within
 

3091
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,990
and found all vertices reachable within
distance k well i didn't

3092
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
distance k well i didn't
 

3093
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,990
distance k well i didn't
i didn't spend any of that distance

3094
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,000
i didn't spend any of that distance
 

3095
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,309
i didn't spend any of that distance
going through this first edge

3096
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:50,319
going through this first edge
 

3097
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,549
going through this first edge
right and i didn't come back to s

3098
00:58:52,549 --> 00:58:52,559
right and i didn't come back to s
 

3099
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,910
right and i didn't come back to s
because these things are directed

3100
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:53,920
because these things are directed
 

3101
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,270
because these things are directed
into the things and so

3102
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:57,280
into the things and so
 

3103
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,069
into the things and so
anything i reach is going to be within

3104
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,079
anything i reach is going to be within
 

3105
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:00,789
anything i reach is going to be within
distance k

3106
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:00,799
distance k
 

3107
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,190

of this donut shop but for all donut

3108
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,200
of this donut shop but for all donut
 

3109
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:03,910
of this donut shop but for all donut
shops

3110
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:03,920
shops
 

3111
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,589
shops
and in some sense i'm doing this search

3112
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:05,599
and in some sense i'm doing this search
 

3113
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,150
and in some sense i'm doing this search
in parallel

3114
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,160
in parallel
 

3115
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,910
in parallel
so this is the same trick that we had in

3116
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:09,920
so this is the same trick that we had in
 

3117
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,150
so this is the same trick that we had in
the like you're looking through the

3118
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160
the like you're looking through the
 

3119
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,990
the like you're looking through the
the sewer network or something and

3120
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,000
the sewer network or something and
 

3121
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,430
the sewer network or something and
they're trying to avoid

3122
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:15,440
they're trying to avoid
 

3123
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,710
they're trying to avoid
monitors or uh you know sensors

3124
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
monitors or uh you know sensors
 

3125
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,510
monitors or uh you know sensors
or something like that we actually did

3126
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:21,520
or something like that we actually did
 

3127
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,950
or something like that we actually did
this transformation and then binary

3128
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
this transformation and then binary
 

3129
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,630
this transformation and then binary
searched on the distance it was

3130
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,640
searched on the distance it was
 

3131
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,390
searched on the distance it was
kind of involved but this is an easier

3132
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
kind of involved but this is an easier
 

3133
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,549
kind of involved but this is an easier
example now you can actually

3134
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
example now you can actually
 

3135
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,510
example now you can actually
generalize this further what if each

3136
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,520
generalize this further what if each
 

3137
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:31,990
generalize this further what if each
donut

3138
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,000

3139
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,589
donut
shop had had us

3140
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:35,599

3141
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,430
shop had had us
uh a like a

00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:39,440
uh a like a
 

3143
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,109
uh a like a
an amount that moamer liked it right so

3144
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:43,119
an amount that moamer liked it right so
 

3145
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,150
an amount that moamer liked it right so
if uh momar is within a

3146
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,160
if uh momar is within a
 

3147
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,910
if uh momar is within a
larger distance of a donut shop he

3148
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:47,920
larger distance of a donut shop he
 

3149
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,510
larger distance of a donut shop he
really likes he still won't be able to

3150
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:49,520
really likes he still won't be able to
 

3151
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,470
really likes he still won't be able to
resist

3152
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
resist
 

3153
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,190
resist
right but a donut shop that doesn't make

3154
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200
right but a donut shop that doesn't make
 

3155
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,309
right but a donut shop that doesn't make
very good donuts

3156
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
very good donuts
 

3157
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,349
very good donuts
you know he'll be able to resist a

3158
00:59:57,349 --> 00:59:57,359
you know he'll be able to resist a
 

3159
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,069
you know he'll be able to resist a
shorter distance without without having

each one of these donut shops has a
 

3169
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,950
each one of these donut shops has a

different k
 

3171
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,829

is there any way to generalize this

3176
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:15,839
is there any way to generalize this
 

3177
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,349
is there any way to generalize this
technique

3178
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:17,359
technique
 

3179
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,109
technique
to be able to prune all of those

3180
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:19,119
to be able to prune all of those
 

3181
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,030
to be able to prune all of those
vertices instead

3182
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040

 

3183
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,470

ah all of these had weight zero before

3184
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:26,480
ah all of these had weight zero before
 

3185
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,030
ah all of these had weight zero before
the same weight i mean the algorithm

3186
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,040
the same weight i mean the algorithm
 

3187
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,710
the same weight i mean the algorithm
would have worked for any weight i put

3188
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:30,720
would have worked for any weight i put
 

3189
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,789
would have worked for any weight i put
on all of these edges

3190
01:00:32,789 --> 01:00:32,799
on all of these edges
 

3191
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,710
on all of these edges
as long as i search the distance that

3192
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
as long as i search the distance that
 

3193
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,470
as long as i search the distance that
weight plus k

3194
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:36,480
weight plus k
 

3195
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,549
weight plus k
right here i can just make the distance

3196
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
right here i can just make the distance
 

3197
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:41,270
right here i can just make the distance
of this

3198
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,280
of this
 

3199
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,990
of this
frontier for each one of the the donut

3200
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,000
frontier for each one of the the donut
 

3201
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,990
frontier for each one of the the donut
shops the same

3202
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:46,000
shops the same
 

3203
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,630
shops the same
by modifying the distance to the of the

3204
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,640
by modifying the distance to the of the
 

3205
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,750
by modifying the distance to the of the
incoming edge

3206
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:49,760
incoming edge
 

3207
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,789
incoming edge
right so i can set the length

3208
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:52,799
right so i can set the length
 

3209
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,750
right so i can set the length
uh the disc the weight from the to the

3210
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:55,760
uh the disc the weight from the to the
 

3211
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,870
uh the disc the weight from the to the
donut shop

3212
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
donut shop
 

3213
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,430
donut shop
with the largest radius to zero

3214
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
with the largest radius to zero
 

3215
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,950
with the largest radius to zero
and then put the difference between the

3216
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
and then put the difference between the
 

3217
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,270
and then put the difference between the
largest radius to all the other ones

3218
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:05,280
largest radius to all the other ones
 

3219
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,910
largest radius to all the other ones
i put that as the weight on the other

3220
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
i put that as the weight on the other
 

3221
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,870
i put that as the weight on the other
edges

3222
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:08,880
edges
 

3223
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,390
edges
and then we still have a graph with

3224
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:10,400
and then we still have a graph with
 

3225
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,710
and then we still have a graph with
positive edge weights

3226
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
positive edge weights
 

3227
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,390
positive edge weights
and i can run dijkstra from this and

3228
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,400
and i can run dijkstra from this and
 

3229
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,150
and i can run dijkstra from this and
that would generalize this problem

3230
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,160
that would generalize this problem
 

3231
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,829
that would generalize this problem
and something that we've done in some

3232
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:17,839
and something that we've done in some
 

3233
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,549
and something that we've done in some
practice exams and or in in exams

3234
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:20,559
practice exams and or in in exams
 

3235
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,710
practice exams and or in in exams
and problem sets in the past okay so

3236
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:22,720
and problem sets in the past okay so
 

3237
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,150
and problem sets in the past okay so
that's another common

3238
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:24,160
that's another common
 

3239
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,190
that's another common
way so we filter

3240
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:27,200

 

3241
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:33,349

filter uh forbidden

3242
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359

 

3243
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,390

there's two b's in forbidden or two d's

3244
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:36,400
there's two b's in forbidden or two d's
 

3245
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,150
there's two b's in forbidden or two d's
two d's there's a three ds

3246
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:40,160
two d's there's a three ds
 

3247
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:45,670
two d's there's a three ds
right vertices

3248
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680

 

3249
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,270

by using

3250
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:51,280

 

3251
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,549

supernode

3252
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:54,559

 

3253
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:08,470

plus one run of dijkstra

3254
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:08,480

 

3255
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,349

those are the extra letters okay so on

3256
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:11,359
those are the extra letters okay so on
 

3257
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,230
those are the extra letters okay so on
your exam

3258
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
your exam
 

3259
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,589
your exam
you would probably want to be a little

3260
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:13,599
you would probably want to be a little
 

3261
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,270
you would probably want to be a little
bit more explicit this is this is a

3262
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,280
bit more explicit this is this is a
 

3263
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,630
bit more explicit this is this is a
summary of the things that we just

3264
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
summary of the things that we just
 

3265
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,589
summary of the things that we just
talked about i just

3266
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599
talked about i just
 

3267
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,829
talked about i just
you know talked 10 minutes about the

3268
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
you know talked 10 minutes about the
 

3269
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,630
you know talked 10 minutes about the
algorithm

3270
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640

 

3271
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,430

but it doesn't hurt to add a summary at

3272
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,440
but it doesn't hurt to add a summary at
 

3273
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,870
but it doesn't hurt to add a summary at
the top of what you're going to write

3274
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:26,880
the top of what you're going to write
 

3275
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,069
the top of what you're going to write
this is the approach that we're going to

3276
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:28,079
this is the approach that we're going to
 

3277
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:28,789
this is the approach that we're going to
have

3278
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:28,799
have
 

3279
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:31,109
have
we're going to filter out the vertices

3280
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:31,119
we're going to filter out the vertices
 

3281
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,829
we're going to filter out the vertices
from g

3282
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:33,839

 

3283
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,430

essentially by running dijkstra from

3284
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,440
essentially by running dijkstra from
 

3285
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,870
essentially by running dijkstra from
each of these

3286
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,880
each of these
 

3287
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,390
each of these
these donut chops but we're going to do

3288
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
these donut chops but we're going to do
 

3289
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,549
these donut chops but we're going to do
it in parallel by adding the super node

3290
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:40,559
it in parallel by adding the super node
 

3291
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,750
it in parallel by adding the super node
okay so actually on

3292
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760
okay so actually on
 

3293
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,990
okay so actually on
another uh uh

3294
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,000
another uh uh
 

3295
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,309
another uh uh
recommendation i have for you on an exam

3296
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319
recommendation i have for you on an exam
 

3297
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,150
recommendation i have for you on an exam
is that almost any problem that we give

3298
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
is that almost any problem that we give
 

3299
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,750
is that almost any problem that we give
you in this class

3300
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:55,760

 

3301
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,990

can get 80 to 90 of the points

3302
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,000
can get 80 to 90 of the points
 

3303
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,589
can get 80 to 90 of the points
by writing like maybe three lines

3304
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:03,599
by writing like maybe three lines
 

3305
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,589
by writing like maybe three lines
right almost and maybe not some of the

3306
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:05,599
right almost and maybe not some of the
 

3307
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,349
right almost and maybe not some of the
data structures problems

3308
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
data structures problems
 

3309
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,150
data structures problems
but almost any question in this class

3310
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:10,160
but almost any question in this class
 

3311
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,470
but almost any question in this class
can

3312
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
can
 

3313
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,510
can
like uh can be solved

3314
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
like uh can be solved
 

3315
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,789
like uh can be solved
with not all of the the points but most

3316
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:16,799
with not all of the the points but most
 

3317
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,710
with not all of the the points but most
of the points

3318
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
of the points
 

3319
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,870
of the points
by just writing a couple lines that we

3320
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:20,880
by just writing a couple lines that we
 

3321
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,870
by just writing a couple lines that we
know that you know how to solve the

3322
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:22,880
know that you know how to solve the
 

3323
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,990
know that you know how to solve the

problem
 

3325
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,109
problem
right and this

3326
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:27,119
right and this
 

3327
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,430
right and this
this would be one of those situations

3328
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:29,440
this would be one of those situations
 

3329
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,430
this would be one of those situations
right

3330
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
right
 

3331
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,670
right
now i would want to give you full points

3332
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:33,680
now i would want to give you full points
 

3333
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,270
now i would want to give you full points
i would want all the details here

3334
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,280
i would want all the details here
 

3335
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,390
i would want all the details here
did i construct a new graph i add this

3336
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
did i construct a new graph i add this
 

3337
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,670
did i construct a new graph i add this

01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,200
the edges some prefix of that pass
 

3509
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,549
the edges some prefix of that pass
path uses exactly the edges

3510
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:54,559
path uses exactly the edges
 

3511
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,990
path uses exactly the edges
right that makes sense right so maybe it

3512
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
right that makes sense right so maybe it
 

3513
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,829
right that makes sense right so maybe it
makes sense for me to

3514
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:01,839
makes sense for me to
 

3515
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,069
makes sense for me to
maybe it might make this problem easier

3516
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
maybe it might make this problem easier
 

3517
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,150
maybe it might make this problem easier
if it's not at least the edges but if

3518
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:06,160
if it's not at least the edges but if
 

3519
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,510
if it's not at least the edges but if
it's exactly the edges

3520
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:07,520
it's exactly the edges
 

3521
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,990
it's exactly the edges
maybe i think about it that way that

3522
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,000
maybe i think about it that way that
 

3523
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,589
maybe i think about it that way that
that seemed a reasonable

3524
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:11,599
that seemed a reasonable
 

3525
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,270
that seemed a reasonable
other way to think about this problem i

3526
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:13,280
other way to think about this problem i
 

3527
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,270
other way to think about this problem i
knew how to do

3528
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,280
knew how to do
 

3529
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,190
knew how to do
up to a certain set of edges

3530
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:19,200
up to a certain set of edges
 

3531
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,470
up to a certain set of edges
here we're asking for at most

3532
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:22,480
here we're asking for at most
 

3533
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,870
here we're asking for at most
maybe the thing in between is a little

3534
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,880
maybe the thing in between is a little
 

3535
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,150
maybe the thing in between is a little
easier to think about

3536
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:28,160
easier to think about
 

3537
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,190
easier to think about
okay so what we're doing we're given a

3538
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:31,200
okay so what we're doing we're given a
 

3539
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,870
okay so what we're doing we're given a
graph

3540
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:32,880
graph
 

3541
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,029
graph
g it has any

3542
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:37,039
g it has any
 

3543
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,630
g it has any
weights

3544
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,640

 

3545
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,349

it's possible that this graph has e

3546
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
it's possible that this graph has e
 

3547
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,510
it's possible that this graph has e
lower bounded by a quadratic in the

3548
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:47,520
lower bounded by a quadratic in the
 

3549
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,910
lower bounded by a quadratic in the
vertices right i have no restrictions on

3550
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:49,920
vertices right i have no restrictions on
 

3551
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,230
vertices right i have no restrictions on
how many edges this thing could be and

3552
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:52,240
how many edges this thing could be and
 

3553
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,109
how many edges this thing could be and
so

3554
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:53,119
so
 

3555
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,710
so
the worst thing i could have is that

3556
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:54,720
the worst thing i could have is that
 

3557
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,789
the worst thing i could have is that
this thing i mean my graphs are simple

3558
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:56,799
this thing i mean my graphs are simple
 

3559
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,710
this thing i mean my graphs are simple
the worst thing i could do is have this

3560
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:58,720
the worst thing i could do is have this
 

3561
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,910
the worst thing i could do is have this
be quadratic

3562
01:07:59,910 --> 01:07:59,920
be quadratic
 

3563
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,910
be quadratic
in the number of edges say if it's the

3564
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
in the number of edges say if it's the
 

3565
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,990
in the number of edges say if it's the
complete graph that's the maximum number

3566
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,000
complete graph that's the maximum number
 

3567
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,270
complete graph that's the maximum number
of edges that i could have

3568
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:07,280

 

3569
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,430

and i'm trying to find in my graph

3570
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:11,440
and i'm trying to find in my graph
 

3571
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,829
and i'm trying to find in my graph
a path that uses a lot of vertices

3572
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:15,839
a path that uses a lot of vertices
 

3573
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,390
a path that uses a lot of vertices
but has small weight now what's another

3574
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:18,400
but has small weight now what's another
 

3575
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,309
but has small weight now what's another
thing to notice here

3576
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:20,319
thing to notice here
 

3577
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,349
thing to notice here
is if i use at least v edges can my path

3578
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:23,359
is if i use at least v edges can my path
 

3579
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,669
is if i use at least v edges can my path
be simple

3580
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:25,679
be simple
 

3581
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,910
be simple
no right because i need to use at least

3582
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:27,920
no right because i need to use at least
 

3583
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,870
no right because i need to use at least
v plus one vertices

3584
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:30,880
v plus one vertices
 

3585
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,189
v plus one vertices
and there are that's more than the

3586
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:33,199
and there are that's more than the
 

3587
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,470
and there are that's more than the
vertices i have in the graph

3588
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:34,480
vertices i have in the graph
 

3589
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,390
vertices i have in the graph
obviously right now it could go through

3590
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:36,400
obviously right now it could go through
 

3591
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,149
obviously right now it could go through
vertices more than once

3592
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:38,159
vertices more than once
 

3593
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,430
vertices more than once
but it's definitely not going to be a

3594
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:39,440
but it's definitely not going to be a
 

3595
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,870
but it's definitely not going to be a
simple path okay

3596
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880

 

3597
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,229

so what's one thing like here's

3598
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
so what's one thing like here's
 

3599
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:49,590
so what's one thing like here's
what if there's a negative weight cycle

3600
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:49,600
what if there's a negative weight cycle
 

3601
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,669
what if there's a negative weight cycle
in my graph

3602
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:53,679
in my graph
 

3603
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,510
in my graph
what's the minimum weight of any path

3604
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:55,520
what's the minimum weight of any path
 

3605
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,510
what's the minimum weight of any path
from s to t

3606
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,520
from s to t
 

3607
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,189
from s to t
if the negative weight cycle is

3608
01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
if the negative weight cycle is
 

3609
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,590
if the negative weight cycle is
reachable from s

3610
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:01,600
reachable from s
 

3611
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,309
reachable from s
reachable on a path from s to t what is

3612
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:04,319
reachable on a path from s to t what is
 

3613
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,550
reachable on a path from s to t what is
the answer to my problem then

3614
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:06,560
the answer to my problem then
 

3615
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,110
the answer to my problem then
negative infinity right because

3616
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,120
negative infinity right because
 

3617
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,149
negative infinity right because

01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
an infinite length path is going to use
 

3621
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,269
an infinite length path is going to use
an infinite number of edges

01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:19,279
right if it's going arbitrarily long
 

3625
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,269
right if it's going arbitrarily long
that's i then i can just run bellman

3626
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
that's i then i can just run bellman
 

3627
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,269
that's i then i can just run bellman
ford right so that's one thing i can do

3628
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:23,279
ford right so that's one thing i can do
 

3629
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:23,829
ford right so that's one thing i can do
i can just

3630
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
i can just
 

3631
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,430
i can just
run bellman ford on this graph i have

3632
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
run bellman ford on this graph i have
 

3633
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,349
run bellman ford on this graph i have
enough time to do that because

3634
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:27,359
enough time to do that because
 

3635
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,110
enough time to do that because

3639
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:33,669

and if there's a negative weight cycle

3640
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:33,679
and if there's a negative weight cycle
 

3641

and if there's a negative weight cycle
in my graph i can know

in my graph i can know
 

3643

in my graph i can know
that the minimum weight of any path is

path actually achieves that but

3664
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
path actually achieves that but
 

3665
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,870
path actually achieves that but
you know that's the in the in fema

3666

you know that's the in the in fema
 

3667
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,149
you know that's the in the in fema
yeah supremum supreme or infimum sorry

3668
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:02,159
yeah supremum supreme or infimum sorry
 

3669
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,750
yeah supremum supreme or infimum sorry
we're going lower bound i'm thinking of

3670
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:03,760
we're going lower bound i'm thinking of
 

3671
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,590
we're going lower bound i'm thinking of
long paths though so the

3672
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:05,600
long paths though so the
 

3673
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,950
long paths though so the
number of edges is approaching infinity

3674
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:08,960
number of edges is approaching infinity
 

3675
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,229
number of edges is approaching infinity
okay but in the context where i don't

3676
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:12,239
okay but in the context where i don't
 

3677
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:12,709
okay but in the context where i don't
have

3678
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:12,719
have
 

3679
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,590
have
negative weight cycles actually one of

3680
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
negative weight cycles actually one of
 

3681
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,870
negative weight cycles actually one of
the things we

3682
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
the things we
 

3683
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,390
the things we
showed was that if you're

3684
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
showed was that if you're
 

3685
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,070
showed was that if you're
reachable not through a negative weight

3686
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:22,080
reachable not through a negative weight
 

3687
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,630
reachable not through a negative weight
cycle or if no negative weight cycle is

3688
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
cycle or if no negative weight cycle is
 

3689
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,430
cycle or if no negative weight cycle is
traversable from s to t then my shortest

3690
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
traversable from s to t then my shortest
 

3691
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,950
traversable from s to t then my shortest
path is going to be

3692
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:28,960
path is going to be
 

3693
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,430
path is going to be
simple but that doesn't seem to apply

3694
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:33,440
simple but that doesn't seem to apply
 

3695
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,030
simple but that doesn't seem to apply
here either because

3696
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,040
here either because
 

3697
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,750
here either because
we need to have a non-simple path so

3698
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:37,760
we need to have a non-simple path so
 

3699
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:43,030
we need to have a non-simple path so
what do we do

3700
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:43,040

 

3701
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,030

so let's go back to this idea of trying

3702
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
so let's go back to this idea of trying
 

3703
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,870
so let's go back to this idea of trying
to figure out the minimum weight of any

3704
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:46,880
to figure out the minimum weight of any
 

3705
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,430
to figure out the minimum weight of any
path

3706
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:47,440
path
 

3707
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,110
path
using exactly the edges can we use some

3708
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,120
using exactly the edges can we use some
 

3709
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,550
using exactly the edges can we use some
of the tricks that we had in bellman

3710
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
of the tricks that we had in bellman
 

3711
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,110
of the tricks that we had in bellman
ford

3712
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:53,120
ford
 

3713
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,709
ford
when we're keeping track of the number

3714
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:54,719
when we're keeping track of the number
 

3715
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,830
when we're keeping track of the number
of edges we're going through at a given

3716
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:56,840
of edges we're going through at a given
 

3717
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,950
of edges we're going through at a given
time

3718
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:58,960
time
 

3719
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,149
time
that's the idea right

3720
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:02,159
that's the idea right
 

3721
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:05,590
that's the idea right
if we have a vertex

3722
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:05,600

 

3723
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,630

if we have a new vertex for each vertex

3724
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,640
if we have a new vertex for each vertex
 

3725
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,350
if we have a new vertex for each vertex
different versions of it that talk about

3726
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:11,360
different versions of it that talk about
 

3727
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:11,990
different versions of it that talk about
exactly

3728
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:12,000
exactly
 

3729
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,709
exactly
how many edges i went through then maybe

3730
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:14,719
how many edges i went through then maybe
 

3731
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,470
how many edges i went through then maybe
i could keep track of this while i'm i'm

3732
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:16,480
i could keep track of this while i'm i'm
 

3733
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,510
i could keep track of this while i'm i'm
working on this graph

3734
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:17,520
working on this graph
 

3735
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,790
working on this graph
right so so let's say i have multiple

3736
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,800
right so so let's say i have multiple
 

3737
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,430
right so so let's say i have multiple
layers

3738
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:21,440
layers
 

3739
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:25,350
layers
of the graph this is the idea

3740
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360

 

3741
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,270

maybe we start at level level 0

3742
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,280
maybe we start at level level 0
 

3743
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,550
maybe we start at level level 0
down here to level how many edges do i

3744
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:32,560
down here to level how many edges do i
 

3745
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,070
down here to level how many edges do i
want i want v

3746
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,080
want i want v
 

3747
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,910
want i want v
plus 1 vertices so i'm going to have v

3748
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:37,920
plus 1 vertices so i'm going to have v
 

3749
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,350
plus 1 vertices so i'm going to have v
plus 1 levels which is v right so

3750
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:41,360
plus 1 levels which is v right so
 

3751
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,870
plus 1 levels which is v right so
a level here

3752
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:44,880

 

3753
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,189

v how many levels are there there's v

3754
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199
v how many levels are there there's v
 

3755
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,229
v how many levels are there there's v
plus the zero

3756
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
plus the zero
 

3757
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,270
plus the zero
yeah and so there i'm going to have

3758
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:51,280
yeah and so there i'm going to have
 

3759
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,630
yeah and so there i'm going to have
for every edge in my graph i'm going to

3760
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
for every edge in my graph i'm going to
 

3761
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,870
for every edge in my graph i'm going to
take

3762
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
take
 

3763
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,110
take
it so this is a directed graph right so

3764
01:11:59,110 --> 01:11:59,120
it so this is a directed graph right so
 

3765
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,790
it so this is a directed graph right so
i direct it down

3766
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:00,800
i direct it down
 

3767
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,430
i direct it down
into the next level for each

3768
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,440

 

3769
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,270

01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:09,280
version of this graph that i have
 

3771
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,590
version of this graph that i have
i take that edge that was originally

3772
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,600
i take that edge that was originally
 

3773
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,630
i take that edge that was originally
between u and v

3774
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:12,640
between u and v
 

3775
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,030
between u and v
here in the graph right it was

3776
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:15,040
here in the graph right it was

3781
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,630
here in g but here i've pointed all of
those edges downward

okay isn't that what we did in bowman

3784
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:26,239
okay isn't that what we did in bowman

transformation we did

3796
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
transformation we did
 

3797
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,950
transformation we did
we had zero eight edges going from each

3798
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:40,960
we had zero eight edges going from each
 

3799
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,790
we had zero eight edges going from each
vertex to another right it meant that we

3800
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:42,800
vertex to another right it meant that we
 

3801
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,030
vertex to another right it meant that we
didn't have to traverse an edge

3802
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:45,040
didn't have to traverse an edge
 

3803
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,270
didn't have to traverse an edge
right but here if we don't add those

3804
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:47,280
right but here if we don't add those
 

3805
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,430
right but here if we don't add those
edges actually this transformation gives

01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:49,440
edges actually this transformation gives
 

3807
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,390
edges actually this transformation gives
us that

3808
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
us that
 

3809
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,229

any path that goes through v edges
 

3811
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:57,510
any path that goes through v edges
will be some path from a vertex in

01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:57,520
will be some path from a vertex in
 

3813
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,110
will be some path from a vertex in

right just because to get down here i

3816
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:03,920
right just because to get down here i
 

3817
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,790
right just because to get down here i
had to traverse

3818
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:04,800
had to traverse
 

3819
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,950
had to traverse
exactly the edges and they're the edges

3820
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:06,960
exactly the edges and they're the edges
 

3821
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,630
exactly the edges and they're the edges
of my original graph

3822
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,640
of my original graph
 

3823
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,910
of my original graph
now notice this encodes

01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
now notice this encodes
 

3825
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,189
now notice this encodes
non-simple paths as well right because

3837
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,110

but right actually what kind of graph is

3838
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:29,120
but right actually what kind of graph is
 

3839
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,110
but right actually what kind of graph is
this

3840
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,120
this
 

3841
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:37,189
this
this is a dac right so this is dag

3842
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:37,199

 

3843
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,310

uh maybe i call this g prime

3844
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
uh maybe i call this g prime
 

3845
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:47,510
uh maybe i call this g prime
how many vertices are in g prime

3846
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:47,520
how many vertices are in g prime
 

3847
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,550
how many vertices are in g prime
v times v plus 1 right so i'm going to

3848
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,560
v times v plus 1 right so i'm going to
 

3849
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,229
v times v plus 1 right so i'm going to
say order

3850
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:52,239
say order
 

3851
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:58,830
say order
v squared and how many edges are on my

3852
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:58,840

 

3853
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,149

graph

3854
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
graph
 

3855
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:03,590
graph
v times e right i i copied

3856
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:03,600
v times e right i i copied
 

3857
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,750
v times e right i i copied
every edge made it directed down between

3858
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
every edge made it directed down between
 

3859
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,350
every edge made it directed down between
each level there are

3860
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
each level there are
 

3861
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,390
each level there are
v transitions between levels and i copy

3862
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:10,400
v transitions between levels and i copy
 

3863
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,110
v transitions between levels and i copy
each edge

3864
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
each edge
 

3865
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,910
each edge
for each of those so the number of edges

3866
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:13,920
for each of those so the number of edges
 

3867
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,390
for each of those so the number of edges
is

3868
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
is
 

3869
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,310
is
order v times e

3870
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
order v times e
 

3871
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,830
order v times e
okay so this graph is blown up

3872
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840
okay so this graph is blown up
 

3873
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,110
okay so this graph is blown up
there's a lot of things in this graph

3874
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,120
there's a lot of things in this graph
 

3875
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,390
there's a lot of things in this graph
but i notice that you know this graph

3876
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,400
but i notice that you know this graph
 

3877
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,510
but i notice that you know this graph
has size

3878
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
has size
 

3879
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,070
has size
order v cubed is what we're going for

3880
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:34,080
order v cubed is what we're going for
 

3881
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,590
order v cubed is what we're going for
so i can afford to construct this graph

3882
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:37,600
so i can afford to construct this graph
 

3883
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,750
so i can afford to construct this graph
since v is actually also

3884
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
since v is actually also
 

3885
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,870
since v is actually also
upper bounded by v squared by simplicity

3886
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:44,880
upper bounded by v squared by simplicity
 

3887
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,950
upper bounded by v squared by simplicity
right okay so we have this graph

3888
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
right okay so we have this graph
 

3889
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,950
right okay so we have this graph
we could find our our vertex

3890
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:52,960
we could find our our vertex
 

3891
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,229
we could find our our vertex
s here as 0 up here

3892
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:56,239
s here as 0 up here
 

3893
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,310
s here as 0 up here
and we could afford to compute the

3894
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:58,320
and we could afford to compute the
 

3895
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,350
and we could afford to compute the
shortest path

3896
01:14:59,350 --> 01:14:59,360
shortest path
 

3897
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,430

01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
distance to all other vertices using
 

3899
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,590
distance to all other vertices using
exactly the edges

3900
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
exactly the edges
 

3901
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,790
exactly the edges
in my graph exactly right

3902
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800
in my graph exactly right
 

3903
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,990
in my graph exactly right
that's what we could do i can

3904
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,000
that's what we could do i can
 

3905
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,030
that's what we could do i can
find everything reachable from s

3906
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:17,040
find everything reachable from s
 

3907
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,669
find everything reachable from s
0 in this graph and calculate the

3908
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
0 in this graph and calculate the
 

3909
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,950
0 in this graph and calculate the
shortest path

3910
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:20,960
shortest path
 

3911
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,709
shortest path
down here at the bottom so i can do that

3912
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:24,719
down here at the bottom so i can do that
 

3913
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:25,510
down here at the bottom so i can do that
in

3914
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:25,520
in
 

3915
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,590
in
v cube time because dag relaxation is

3916
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:27,600
v cube time because dag relaxation is
 

3917
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,870
v cube time because dag relaxation is
linear in the size of the graph

3918
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:30,880
linear in the size of the graph
 

3919
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,390
linear in the size of the graph
but that's not what the problem's asking

3920
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:32,400
but that's not what the problem's asking
 

3921
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,149
but that's not what the problem's asking
me unfortunately

3922
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,159
me unfortunately
 

3923
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:37,110
me unfortunately
right uh in particular i could find the

3924
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,120
right uh in particular i could find the
 

3925
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,189
right uh in particular i could find the
path to t

3926
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:39,199
path to t
 

3927
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:42,229
path to t
to t v and that would give me

3928
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:42,239
to t v and that would give me
 

3929
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,550
to t v and that would give me
the shortest path using exactly the

3930
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,560
the shortest path using exactly the
 

3931
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,110
the shortest path using exactly the
edges but that's not what i'm asking for

3932
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,120
edges but that's not what i'm asking for
 

3933
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,950
edges but that's not what i'm asking for
i'm asking for at least

3934
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:50,960
i'm asking for at least
 

3935
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,270
i'm asking for at least
so it's possible that i get down here to

3936
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
so it's possible that i get down here to
 

3937
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,110
so it's possible that i get down here to
some other vertex

3938
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:55,120
some other vertex
 

3939
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,790
some other vertex
and maybe there's a negative weight path

3940
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:58,800
and maybe there's a negative weight path
 

3941
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,189
and maybe there's a negative weight path
going to t and i want to be able to find

3942
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:01,199
going to t and i want to be able to find
 

3943
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,630
going to t and i want to be able to find
that

3944
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:04,640

 

3945
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,630

so how can i do that how can i allow

3946
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:06,640
so how can i do that how can i allow
 

3947
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,229
so how can i do that how can i allow
paths to continue

3948
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:08,239
paths to continue
 

3949
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,669
paths to continue
past this

3950
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:11,679

 

3951
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,870

an arbitrary amount

3952
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:14,880

 

3953
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,669

i could have more layers right right

3954
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:17,679
i could have more layers right right
 

3955
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:18,790
i could have more layers right right
actually

3956
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:18,800
actually
 

3957
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,830
actually
simple paths uh from

3958
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
simple paths uh from
 

3959
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,709
simple paths uh from
any ver i mean shortest paths that are

3960
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:24,719
any ver i mean shortest paths that are
 

3961
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:25,430
any ver i mean shortest paths that are
simple

3962
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
simple
 

3963
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,310
simple
right that use fewer edges right here

3964
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
right that use fewer edges right here
 

3965
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,070
right that use fewer edges right here
here i'm not restricted on the number of

3966
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,080
here i'm not restricted on the number of
 

3967
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,350
here i'm not restricted on the number of
edges i use

3968
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,360
edges i use
 

3969
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,550
edges i use
right so shortest paths in this graph

3970
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
right so shortest paths in this graph
 

3971
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,070
right so shortest paths in this graph
are going to be simple because there's

3972
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
are going to be simple because there's
 

3973
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,229
are going to be simple because there's
no negative i've already i can already

3974
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:38,239
no negative i've already i can already
 

3975
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:39,750
no negative i've already i can already
like throw away the case where i have

3976
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,760
like throw away the case where i have
 

3977
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,430
like throw away the case where i have
negative cycles because i ran bellman

3978
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
negative cycles because i ran bellman
 

3979
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,390
negative cycles because i ran bellman
ford at the beginning

3980
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:42,400
ford at the beginning
 

3981
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,669
ford at the beginning
right i can

3982
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:45,679
right i can
 

3983
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,830
right i can
uh i so i know that i'm going to want

3984
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
uh i so i know that i'm going to want
 

3985
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,910
uh i so i know that i'm going to want
a short pat a simple path

3986
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
a short pat a simple path
 

3987
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,830
a short pat a simple path
after i've reached the edges

3988
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:57,840
after i've reached the edges
 

3989
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,350
after i've reached the edges
because it's never going to be

3990
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,360
because it's never going to be
 

3991
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,510
because it's never going to be
beneficial to me to

3992
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,520
beneficial to me to
 

3993
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,390
beneficial to me to
come back to a vertex because that will

3994
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:04,400
come back to a vertex because that will
 

3995
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,510
come back to a vertex because that will
be a path of

3996
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:05,520
be a path of
 

3997
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,510
be a path of
longer weight right this is the the kind

3998
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520
longer weight right this is the the kind
 

3999
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,350
longer weight right this is the the kind
of surgery argument we had

4000
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,360
of surgery argument we had
 

4001
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,149
of surgery argument we had
both in unweighted and weighted context

4002
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
both in unweighted and weighted context
 

4003
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:12,950
both in unweighted and weighted context
okay

4004
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
okay
 

4005
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,790
okay
so these are going to be simple so i

4006
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:14,800
so these are going to be simple so i
 

4007
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,470
so these are going to be simple so i
know that i only have to go

4008
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,480
know that i only have to go
 

4009
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,510
know that i only have to go
v more layers

4010
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:19,520
v more layers
 

4011
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,750
v more layers
at most okay so that's one way to look

4012
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:21,760
at most okay so that's one way to look
 

4013
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,830
at most okay so that's one way to look
at it i could add more layers of this

4014
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:23,840
at it i could add more layers of this
 

4015
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,470
at it i could add more layers of this
thing

4016
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:24,480
thing
 

4017
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,510
thing
find the shortest path distance to all

4018
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:27,520
find the shortest path distance to all
 

4019
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,790
find the shortest path distance to all

4020
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:28,800
vertices
 

4021
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,310
vertices
using uh up to two v

4022
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:32,320
using uh up to two v
 

4023
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,750
using uh up to two v
edges right maybe even

4024
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:35,760
edges right maybe even
 

4025
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,590
edges right maybe even
two v minus one but order v

4026
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:39,600
two v minus one but order v
 

4027
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,149
two v minus one but order v
and then for all of the ones down below

4028
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:42,159
and then for all of the ones down below
 

4029
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,229
and then for all of the ones down below
here i just look at each vertex

4030
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:44,239
here i just look at each vertex
 

4031
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,189
here i just look at each vertex
and see which weight is the minimum

4032
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:47,199
and see which weight is the minimum
 

4033
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,310
and see which weight is the minimum
right

4034
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,320

 

4035
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,310

another way the way i like to look at it

4036
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
another way the way i like to look at it
 

4037
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,750
another way the way i like to look at it
which is a little bit more fun

4038
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:53,760
which is a little bit more fun
 

4039
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,870
which is a little bit more fun
i think is once i'm down here

4040
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
i think is once i'm down here
 

4041
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,350
i think is once i'm down here
i'm just trying to find simple paths in

01:17:59,350 --> 01:17:59,360
i'm just trying to find simple paths in
 

4043
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,390
i'm just trying to find simple paths in
the graph

4044
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,400
the graph
 

4045
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,550
the graph
from this vertex v right

01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
from this vertex v right
 

4047
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,910
from this vertex v right
to this vertex v right so one of the

01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:07,920
to this vertex v right so one of the
 

4049
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,990
to this vertex v right so one of the
so actually um add these

4050
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:12,000
so actually um add these
 

4051
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,189
so actually um add these
go up

4052
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:17,199

 

4053
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:20,630

so actually on this bottom layer right

4054
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:20,640
so actually on this bottom layer right
 

4055
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,310
so actually on this bottom layer right
i want to find ver uh

4056
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:24,320
i want to find ver uh

01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
right and i actually know
 

4063
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,910
right and i actually know
what the short just from from what i did

4064
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
what the short just from from what i did
 

4065
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,790
what the short just from from what i did
up here dag relaxation on this graph

4066
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
up here dag relaxation on this graph
 

4067
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,870
up here dag relaxation on this graph
i knew what the shortest path distance

4068
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:38,880
i knew what the shortest path distance
 

4069
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,870
i knew what the shortest path distance
was from s0

4070
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:40,880
was from s0
 

4071
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,950
was from s0
to each of these vertices because i did

4072
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:42,960
to each of these vertices because i did
 

4073
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,790
to each of these vertices because i did
that in v cube time

4074
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
that in v cube time
 

4075
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,870
that in v cube time
up here with dag relaxation so i could

4076
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:46,880
up here with dag relaxation so i could
 

4077
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,709
up here with dag relaxation so i could
add a super node to this thing with a

4078
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:48,719
add a super node to this thing with a
 

4079
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:49,910
add a super node to this thing with a
directed edge

4080
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920
directed edge
 

4081
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,510
directed edge
to each vertex with the

4082
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
to each vertex with the
 

4083
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,510
to each vertex with the
shortest with weighted by the shortest

4084
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:55,520
shortest with weighted by the shortest
 

4085
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,830
shortest with weighted by the shortest
path distance i found up above

4086
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840

 

4087
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,950

now i have a graph where any

4088
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:02,960
now i have a graph where any
 

4089
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,990
now i have a graph where any
path from s0 to

4090
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,000
path from s0 to
 

4091
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,350
path from s0 to
v to t v here

4092
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
v to t v here
 

4093
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,630
v to t v here
will be a path that uses at least

4094
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:12,640
will be a path that uses at least
 

4095
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,669
will be a path that uses at least
the edges in my original graph right

4096
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:15,679
the edges in my original graph right
 

4097
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,070
the edges in my original graph right
because these represent the shortest

4098
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:18,080
because these represent the shortest
 

4099
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,110
because these represent the shortest
path weights of

4100
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:19,120
path weights of
 

4101
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,310
path weights of
anything using exactly the edges

4102
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
anything using exactly the edges
 

4103
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,390
anything using exactly the edges
and then the path can continue in the

4104
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:24,400
and then the path can continue in the
 

4105
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,550
and then the path can continue in the
original graph

4106
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:26,560
original graph
 

4107
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,229
original graph
right so now i have a new graph here

4108
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
right so now i have a new graph here
 

4109
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,870
right so now i have a new graph here
such that every path from here to there

4110
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:32,880
such that every path from here to there
 

4111
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,830
such that every path from here to there
corresponds to a path that i'm looking

4112
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:34,840
corresponds to a path that i'm looking
 

4113
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,070
corresponds to a path that i'm looking
for

4114
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
for
 

4115
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,830
for
so i want to find a minimum weight path

4116
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:37,840
so i want to find a minimum weight path
 

4117
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,430
so i want to find a minimum weight path
in this graph how can i do that

4118
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:39,440
in this graph how can i do that
 

4119
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,270
in this graph how can i do that
now this graph might have negative

4120
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:41,280
now this graph might have negative
 

4121
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,990
now this graph might have negative
negative weights

4122
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:44,000
negative weights
 

4123
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,830
negative weights
i can run this with bellman ford

4124
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:48,840

 

4125
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,709

fellman ford

4126

fellman ford
 

4127
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,870
fellman ford
i can do that again sure why not

4128
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:54,880

 

4129
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,149

now jason

4130
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
now jason
 

4131
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,750
now jason
why couldn't we just add a bunch of

01:19:59,750 --> 01:19:59,760
why couldn't we just add a bunch of
 

4133
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,590
why couldn't we just add a bunch of

4134
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:01,600

layer of this graph
 

4139
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,550
layer of this graph
and run bellman ford on this entire

4140
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,560
and run bellman ford on this entire
 

4141
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,390
and run bellman ford on this entire
graph why couldn't i do that

4142
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:10,400

 

4143
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,310

it's too big right the number of

4144
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:12,320
it's too big right the number of
 

4145
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,910
it's too big right the number of
vertices is v squared the number of

4146
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:13,920
vertices is v squared the number of
 

4147
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,510
vertices is v squared the number of
edges is v

4148
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:15,520
edges is v
 

4149
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,470
edges is v
potentially v cubed running bellman ford

4150
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
potentially v cubed running bellman ford
 

4151
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,470
potentially v cubed running bellman ford
on that huge duplicated graph

4152
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:20,480
on that huge duplicated graph
 

4153
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,390
on that huge duplicated graph
would give me a v to the fifth running

4154
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,400
would give me a v to the fifth running
 

4155
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,229
would give me a v to the fifth running
time which is awful

4156
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,239
time which is awful
 

4157
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,310
time which is awful
right in a sense we're separating out

4158
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
right in a sense we're separating out
 

4159
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,270
right in a sense we're separating out
the complexity

4160
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:27,280
the complexity
 

4161
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,870
the complexity
the upper part of the graph has very

4162
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:28,880
the upper part of the graph has very
 

4163
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,110
the upper part of the graph has very
nice dag structure so let's do shortest

4164
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120
nice dag structure so let's do shortest
 

4165
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,430
nice dag structure so let's do shortest
paths in that dag structure

4166
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
paths in that dag structure
 

4167
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,110
paths in that dag structure
and then reduce that complexity down

4168
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,120
and then reduce that complexity down
 

4169
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,110
and then reduce that complexity down
to just being the thing that has the

4170
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:39,120
to just being the thing that has the
 

4171
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,229
to just being the thing that has the
cycles that we

4172
01:20:40,229 --> 01:20:40,239

so running bellman ford here only takes
 

4197
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:09,669
so running bellman ford here only takes
v times e time
