that material on quiz 3 but uh

36
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
that material on quiz 3 but uh
 

37
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,110
that material on quiz 3 but uh
you know it is fair game uh the material

38
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
you know it is fair game uh the material
 

39
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,709
you know it is fair game uh the material
is cumulative and so if

40
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
is cumulative and so if
 

41
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,069
is cumulative and so if
you know you have to store some stuff in

42
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
you know you have to store some stuff in
 

43
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,910
you know you have to store some stuff in
the data structure that's that's fair

44
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
the data structure that's that's fair
 

45
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,670
the data structure that's that's fair
game but we're not specifically trying

00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
game but we're not specifically trying
 

47
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,510
game but we're not specifically trying
to test you on that material

48
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
to test you on that material
 

49
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,549
to test you on that material
okay and really we haven't learned all

50
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
okay and really we haven't learned all
 

51
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,429
okay and really we haven't learned all
that much

52
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
that much
 

53
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,910
that much
new material in these last four lectures

00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
new material in these last four lectures
 

55
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,910

uh so right so this is scope we've got

58
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
uh so right so this is scope we've got
 

59
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,910
uh so right so this is scope we've got
uh you know we're mostly handling

60
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
uh you know we're mostly handling
 

61
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,350
uh you know we're mostly handling
dynamic programming

62
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
dynamic programming
 

63
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,429
dynamic programming
uh on these these four lectures and

64
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
uh on these these four lectures and
 

65
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,310
uh on these these four lectures and
recitations and these two problem sets

66
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
recitations and these two problem sets
 

67
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,630
recitations and these two problem sets
but really the focus is going to be on

68
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
but really the focus is going to be on
 

69
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,310
but really the focus is going to be on
this recursive framework

70
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
this recursive framework
 

71
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,950
this recursive framework
of solving problems with a focus on

72
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
of solving problems with a focus on
 

73
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,270
of solving problems with a focus on
dynamic programming specifically

74
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
dynamic programming specifically
 

75
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,990
dynamic programming specifically
now the recursive framework we've we

76
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
now the recursive framework we've we
 

77
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,469
now the recursive framework we've we
have

78
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
have
 

79
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,950
have
i think in previous

80
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
i think in previous
 

81
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,069
i think in previous
slides we use this uh sort bot notation

82
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
slides we use this uh sort bot notation
 

83
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,429
slides we use this uh sort bot notation
and i think there might be a space

84
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
and i think there might be a space
 

85
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,389
and i think there might be a space
there uh in in previous versions i'm

86
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
there uh in in previous versions i'm
 

87
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,310
there uh in in previous versions i'm
concatenating them together here

88
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
concatenating them together here
 

89
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,230
concatenating them together here
but really it's it's a framework for

90
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
but really it's it's a framework for
 

91
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,830
but really it's it's a framework for
solving breaking down your problem

92
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
solving breaking down your problem
 

93
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,590
solving breaking down your problem
into a set of sub-problems that can then

94
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
into a set of sub-problems that can then
 

95
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,230
into a set of sub-problems that can then
be related recursively

96
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
be related recursively
 

97
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,270
be related recursively
and if that relationship depends on

98
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
and if that relationship depends on
 

99
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,469
and if that relationship depends on
problems in a

100
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
problems in a
 

101
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,749
problems in a
decreasing or in a smaller sense right

102
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
decreasing or in a smaller sense right
 

103
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,790
decreasing or in a smaller sense right
there's a directionality to

104
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
there's a directionality to
 

105
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,949
there's a directionality to
which subproblems i'm reducing to each

106
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
which subproblems i'm reducing to each
 

107
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,869
which subproblems i'm reducing to each
time i make a recursive call

108
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
time i make a recursive call
 

109
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,550
time i make a recursive call
and that dependency graph is acyclic

110
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
and that dependency graph is acyclic
 

111
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,270
and that dependency graph is acyclic
then we can solve

112
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
then we can solve
 

113
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,910
then we can solve
via dynamic programming by memoizing

114
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
via dynamic programming by memoizing
 

115
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,430
via dynamic programming by memoizing
from bottom up

116
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
from bottom up
 

117
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,150
from bottom up
or by calling things and remembering the

or by calling things and remembering the

we've called before uh via memoization

00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
we've called before uh via memoization
 

123
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,869
we've called before uh via memoization
right and the basic idea here is this

00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
right and the basic idea here is this
 

125
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,070
right and the basic idea here is this
the recursive framework

126
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
is good for any recursive algorithm
 

131
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,509
is good for any recursive algorithm
but in the special case where

132
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
but in the special case where
 

133
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,110

when computing other subproblems then we

138
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
when computing other subproblems then we
 

139
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,670
when computing other subproblems then we
get this really nice

140
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
get this really nice
 

141
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,910
get this really nice
uh speed up by recognizing that we don't

142
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
uh speed up by recognizing that we don't
 

143
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,470
uh speed up by recognizing that we don't
have to do that work more than once

144
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
have to do that work more than once
 

145
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,790
have to do that work more than once
and essentially instead of looking at it

146
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
and essentially instead of looking at it
 

147
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,710
and essentially instead of looking at it
as a tree of recursive calls

148
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
as a tree of recursive calls
 

149
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,790
as a tree of recursive calls
that may recall the same problems more

150
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
that may recall the same problems more
 

151
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,270
that may recall the same problems more
than once we look at it by collapsing

152
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
than once we look at it by collapsing
 

153
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,190
than once we look at it by collapsing
those nodes of the same

154
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
those nodes of the same
 

155
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,309
those nodes of the same
value down into one we get a dag

156
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
value down into one we get a dag
 

157
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,990

and dynamic programming is is when those

00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
sub-problems but
 

199
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,830
sub-problems but
frequently is just you know finding one

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,509
or something like that
and then analyze the time now the last

210
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
and then analyze the time now the last
 

211
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,030
and then analyze the time now the last
one isn't really

212
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
one isn't really

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,949
one isn't really
important for solving a problem

214
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
important for solving a problem
 

215
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,390
important for solving a problem
recursively but in this class it's

216
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
recursively but in this class it's
 

217
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,710
recursively but in this class it's
really important because we want to

218
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
really important because we want to
 

219
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,870
really important because we want to
tell whether the algorithms that we make

220
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
tell whether the algorithms that we make
 

221
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,150
tell whether the algorithms that we make
are efficient so

222
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
are efficient so
 

223
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,870
are efficient so
let's dive a little deeper into each one

224
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
let's dive a little deeper into each one
 

225
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,550
let's dive a little deeper into each one
of these things

226
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
of these things
 

227
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,230
of these things
so when we approach a sub-problem

228
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
so when we approach a sub-problem
 

229
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,629
so when we approach a sub-problem
really what i'm asking you for is to

230
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
really what i'm asking you for is to
 

231
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,469
really what i'm asking you for is to
describe

232
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
describe
 

233
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,230
describe
basically set up a set of sub-problems

234
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
basically set up a set of sub-problems
 

235
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,830
basically set up a set of sub-problems
basically

236
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
basically
 

237
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,070
basically
i like to use the variable x but you can

238
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
i like to use the variable x but you can
 

239
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,390
i like to use the variable x but you can
use whatever variable you want

240
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
use whatever variable you want
 

241
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,629
use whatever variable you want
but basically you're telling us what's

242
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
but basically you're telling us what's
 

243
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,550
but basically you're telling us what's
in your memo and how big your memo is

244
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
in your memo and how big your memo is
 

245
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,909
in your memo and how big your memo is
right so we we usually have x

246
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
right so we we usually have x
 

247
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,749
right so we we usually have x
as a function of some variables

248
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
as a function of some variables
 

249
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,990
as a function of some variables
and you're wanting to describe to me

250
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
and you're wanting to describe to me
 

251
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,909
and you're wanting to describe to me
what the meaning of that sub-problem is

252
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
what the meaning of that sub-problem is
 

253
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,510
what the meaning of that sub-problem is
in terms of the parameters

254
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
in terms of the parameters
 

255
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,350
in terms of the parameters
now if you have parameters in your

256
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
now if you have parameters in your
 

257
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,830
now if you have parameters in your
sub-problem that don't appear

258
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
sub-problem that don't appear
 

259
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,749
sub-problem that don't appear
in your sub-problem definition you're

260
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
in your sub-problem definition you're
 

261
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,270
in your sub-problem definition you're
doing it wrong and you're probably not

262
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
doing it wrong and you're probably not
 

263
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,029
doing it wrong and you're probably not
going to get points for the problem

264
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
going to get points for the problem
 

265
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,150
going to get points for the problem
because i don't know what your

266
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
because i don't know what your
 

267
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,469
because i don't know what your
sub-problem means now right even if it's

268
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
sub-problem means now right even if it's
 

269
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,990
sub-problem means now right even if it's
a correct sub-problem and you do the

270
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
a correct sub-problem and you do the
 

271
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,110
a correct sub-problem and you do the
rest of it right

272
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120

 

273
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,070

part of this class is about

274
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
part of this class is about
 

275
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,270
part of this class is about
communication and if you're not

276
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
communication and if you're not
 

277
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,270
communication and if you're not
communicating to us what this

278
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
communicating to us what this
 

279
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,270
communicating to us what this
thing is doing it's really difficult for

280
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
thing is doing it's really difficult for
 

281
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,629
thing is doing it's really difficult for
you us to

282
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
you us to
 

283
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,830
you us to
for us for you to convince us that your

284
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
for us for you to convince us that your
 

285
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,350
for us for you to convince us that your
algorithm is correct

286
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
algorithm is correct
 

287
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,510
algorithm is correct
right so you really want to in words

288
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
right so you really want to in words
 

289
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,710
right so you really want to in words
describe

290
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
describe
 

291
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,029
describe
what the output of your sub problem is

292
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
what the output of your sub problem is
 

293
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,710
what the output of your sub problem is
what will the memo return to me

294
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
what will the memo return to me
 

295
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,510
what will the memo return to me
and how those return values depend on

296
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
and how those return values depend on
 

297
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,310
and how those return values depend on
the inputs

298
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
the inputs
 

299
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,310
the inputs
right the parameters of your sub problem

300
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
right the parameters of your sub problem
 

301
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,110
right the parameters of your sub problem
right so that's what in words describe

302
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
right so that's what in words describe
 

303
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,950
right so that's what in words describe
what a sub problem means so that's

304
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
what a sub problem means so that's
 

305
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,230
what a sub problem means so that's
that's going to be a really important

306
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
that's going to be a really important
 

307
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,189
that's going to be a really important
thing for you not to

308
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
thing for you not to
 

309
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,550
thing for you not to
forget on a quiz then when making sub

310
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
forget on a quiz then when making sub
 

311
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,510
forget on a quiz then when making sub
problems often

312
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
problems often
 

313
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,550
problems often
what we're doing is we're recursing

314
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
what we're doing is we're recursing
 

315
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,870
what we're doing is we're recursing
on different values of indices in a

316
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
on different values of indices in a
 

317
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,710
on different values of indices in a
sequence

318
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
sequence
 

319
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,629
sequence
or numbers in your problem right that's

320
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
or numbers in your problem right that's
 

321
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,950
or numbers in your problem right that's
kind of what we got to in the last

322
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
kind of what we got to in the last
 

323
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,309
kind of what we got to in the last
in lecture 18 i guess uh when we were

324
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
in lecture 18 i guess uh when we were
 

325
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,350
in lecture 18 i guess uh when we were
talking about

326
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
talking about
 

327
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,189
talking about
expanding subproblems based on an

328
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
expanding subproblems based on an
 

329
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,189
expanding subproblems based on an
integer in a problem now actually

330
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
integer in a problem now actually
 

331
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,189
integer in a problem now actually
an integer in our problem is the number

332
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
an integer in our problem is the number
 

333
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,110
an integer in our problem is the number
of things in a sequence

334
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
of things in a sequence
 

335
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,189
of things in a sequence
right and so really those indices are

336
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
right and so really those indices are
 

337
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,029
right and so really those indices are
integers in our problem that we're

338
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039

then you might want to use sub right so

378
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
then you might want to use sub right so
 

379
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,510
then you might want to use sub right so
basically contiguous subsequences

380
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
basically contiguous subsequences
 

381
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,150
basically contiguous subsequences
of your sequence because you might need

382
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
of your sequence because you might need
 

383
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,589
of your sequence because you might need
that flexibility

384
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
that flexibility
 

385
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,430
that flexibility
when recursing downward if you need to

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
when recursing downward if you need to
 

387
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,029
when recursing downward if you need to
take something from both the front and

take something from both the front and
 

389
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,870
take something from both the front and
the back for example

391
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,430

right and really what's the difference

392
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
right and really what's the difference
 

393
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,430
right and really what's the difference
between prefixes and suffixes

not much okay we've been concentrating
 

397
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,990
not much okay we've been concentrating
on suffixes in this class because

398
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
on suffixes in this class because
 

399
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,430
on suffixes in this class because
in some sense it's easier to think about

400
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
in some sense it's easier to think about
 

401
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,430
in some sense it's easier to think about
what am i doing with the first

what am i doing with the first
 

403
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,830
what am i doing with the first

and then i can recurse on what happens

408
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
and then i can recurse on what happens
 

409
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,589

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
you look at it the other way what do i'm
 

449
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,710
you look at it the other way what do i'm
doing with my last element

doing with my last element
 

451
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,710
doing with my last element
right if i look at what i'm doing at the

452
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
right if i look at what i'm doing at the
 

453
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,709
right if i look at what i'm doing at the
last time i recurse on a prefix on the

stuff that's before me
 

457
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,990
stuff that's before me
and then when i do bottom up i start

458
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
and then when i do bottom up i start
 

459
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,269
and then when i do bottom up i start
from the front

460
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
from the front
 

461
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,509
from the front
and work my way up right it's just it's

462
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
and work my way up right it's just it's
 

463
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,670
and work my way up right it's just it's
two different sides of the same coin

starting to learn dynamic programming
 

473
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,350
starting to learn dynamic programming
it's it's a lot

474
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
it's it's a lot
 

475
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,110
it's it's a lot
we read things from left to right and

476
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
we read things from left to right and
 

477
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,110
we read things from left to right and
things like that it's a lot easier to

478
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
things like that it's a lot easier to
 

479
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,230
things like that it's a lot easier to
figure out what's happening with the

480
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
figure out what's happening with the
 

481
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,030
figure out what's happening with the
first thing

482
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
first thing
 

483
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,710
first thing
and move forward conceptually it's

484
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
and move forward conceptually it's
 

485
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,150
and move forward conceptually it's
actually exactly the same thing

486
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
actually exactly the same thing
 

487
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,190
actually exactly the same thing
i could just flip my sequence

488
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
i could just flip my sequence
 

489
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,750
i could just flip my sequence
do the exact same thing with prefixes it

490
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
do the exact same thing with prefixes it
 

491
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,070
do the exact same thing with prefixes it
would be the exact same dynamic program

492
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
would be the exact same dynamic program
 

493
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,470
would be the exact same dynamic program
right so there's these things are

494
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
right so there's these things are
 

495
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,350
right so there's these things are
interchangeable

496
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
interchangeable
 

497
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,670
interchangeable
it's just it's really useful when

498
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
it's just it's really useful when
 

499
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,670
it's just it's really useful when
learning into dynamic program

500
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
learning into dynamic program
 

501
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,070

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
we'll be working on suffixes today on
 

507
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,310
we'll be working on suffixes today on
the problems that we do

508
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
the problems that we do
 

509
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,990
the problems that we do
but these are interchangeable and

510
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
but these are interchangeable and
 

511
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,750
but these are interchangeable and
sometimes it's useful to be able to

512
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
sometimes it's useful to be able to
 

513
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,509
sometimes it's useful to be able to
conceptually think about it

514
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
conceptually think about it
 

515
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,350
conceptually think about it
in both directions okay

516
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360

 

517
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,190

so aside from dealing with subsequences

518
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
so aside from dealing with subsequences
 

519
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,150
so aside from dealing with subsequences
of sequences in particular contiguous

520
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
of sequences in particular contiguous
 

521
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,190
of sequences in particular contiguous
ones

522
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
ones
 

523
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,230
ones
uh we also often multiply our subsets uh

524
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
uh we also often multiply our subsets uh
 

525
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,870
uh we also often multiply our subsets uh
across multiple inputs like if we have

526
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
across multiple inputs like if we have
 

527
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,269
across multiple inputs like if we have
uh

528
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
uh
 

529
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,310
uh
multiple sequences we might take indices

530
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
multiple sequences we might take indices
 

531
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,910
multiple sequences we might take indices
in each one of them to represent

532
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
in each one of them to represent
 

533
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,389
in each one of them to represent
prefixes or suffixes

534
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
prefixes or suffixes
 

535
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,829
prefixes or suffixes
and then we might have to remember

536
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
and then we might have to remember
 

537
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,590
and then we might have to remember
additional information by maintaining

538
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
additional information by maintaining
 

539
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,310

how much space i have left
 

585
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,990
how much space i have left
to pack okay so that's subproblems

586
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
to pack okay so that's subproblems
 

587
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,990
to pack okay so that's subproblems
this is really the key part about

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120

 

599
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,230

relating those in math terms
 

627
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,990
relating those in math terms
to the other things this is it's really

628
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
to the other things this is it's really
 

629
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,949
to the other things this is it's really
important that you

630
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
important that you
 

631
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,670
important that you
write this in math because it needs to

632
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
write this in math because it needs to
 

633
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,550
write this in math because it needs to
be precise

634
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
be precise
 

635
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,550
be precise
to communicate this thing well now you

636
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
to communicate this thing well now you
 

637
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,990
to communicate this thing well now you
can write it in words

638
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
can write it in words
 

639
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,150
can write it in words
but i would suggest you write it as a

640
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
but i would suggest you write it as a
 

641
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,509
but i would suggest you write it as a
mathematical expression

642
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
mathematical expression
 

643
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,069
mathematical expression
because it's a lot more concise for us

644
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
because it's a lot more concise for us
 

645
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,670

you might recurse on
 

673
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,389
you might recurse on
basically you're going to depend on some

basically you're going to depend on some
 

675
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,230

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,389
that are smaller in some sense now
actually embedded in this the idea of a

680
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
actually embedded in this the idea of a
 

681
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,509
actually embedded in this the idea of a
smaller sub problem isn't really well

682
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
smaller sub problem isn't really well
 

683
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,629
smaller sub problem isn't really well
defined yet

684
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
defined yet
 

685
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,829
defined yet
right we haven't told you an ordering

686
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
right we haven't told you an ordering
 

687
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,430
right we haven't told you an ordering
of these sub-problems to be smaller

688
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
of these sub-problems to be smaller
 

689
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,870
of these sub-problems to be smaller
but that's what's going to come in the

690
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
but that's what's going to come in the
 

691
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,430
but that's what's going to come in the
third step right

692
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
third step right
 

693
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,629
third step right
so kind of a strategy for

694
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
so kind of a strategy for
 

695
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,910
so kind of a strategy for
figuring out what these recursive

696
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
figuring out what these recursive
 

697
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,470
figuring out what these recursive
relations might be is to identify some

698
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
relations might be is to identify some
 

699
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,350
relations might be is to identify some
question about the subproblem solution

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
question about the subproblem solution
 

701
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,389
question about the subproblem solution
right uh what do i do with the first

702
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
right uh what do i do with the first
 

703
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,710
right uh what do i do with the first
character in this string

704
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
character in this string
 

705
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,110
character in this string
or um you know

706
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
or um you know
 

707
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,750
or um you know
which cage do i put this tiger in right

708
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
which cage do i put this tiger in right
 

709
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,350
which cage do i put this tiger in right
to to figure out what sub problem should

710
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
to to figure out what sub problem should
 

711
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,949
to to figure out what sub problem should
i recurse on later i don't know the

712
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
i recurse on later i don't know the
 

713
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,110
i recurse on later i don't know the
answer to that question

714
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
answer to that question
 

715
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,470
answer to that question
but if i knew the answer to that

716
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
but if i knew the answer to that
 

717
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,350
but if i knew the answer to that
question then i could

718
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
question then i could
 

719
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,269
question then i could
recurse on a smaller sub problem because

720
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
recurse on a smaller sub problem because
 

721
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,269
recurse on a smaller sub problem because
i've figured out what to do with that

722
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
i've figured out what to do with that
 

723
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,710
i've figured out what to do with that
tiger right and so

724
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
tiger right and so
 

725
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,389
tiger right and so
it will let me reduce to smaller

726
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
it will let me reduce to smaller
 

727
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,910
it will let me reduce to smaller
subproblems and then

728
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
subproblems and then
 

729
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,150
subproblems and then
what dynamic programming does is because

730
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
what dynamic programming does is because
 

731
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,509
what dynamic programming does is because
i only have a polynomial

what the solutions to those sub-problems
 

743
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,509
what the solutions to those sub-problems
are then i can just locally brute force

okay so then as we were talking about

752
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
okay so then as we were talking about
 

753
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,990
okay so then as we were talking about
topological order

754
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
topological order
 

755
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,629
topological order
arguing that relation is a cyclic

00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
arguing that relation is a cyclic
 

757
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,629
arguing that relation is a cyclic
essentially just defining what smaller

when we say we're recursing on smaller
sub-problems what a smaller mean

sub-problems what a smaller mean
 

765
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,870
sub-problems what a smaller mean
usually you're saying that some

766
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
usually you're saying that some
 

767
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,470
usually you're saying that some
index or some parameter of my

768
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
index or some parameter of my
 

769
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,870

sub-problem decrease always decreases or

770
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
sub-problem decrease always decreases or
 

771
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,750
sub-problem decrease always decreases or
increases

772
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
increases
 

773
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,189
increases
sometimes that's not always the case

774
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
sometimes that's not always the case
 

775
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,350
sometimes that's not always the case
some sometimes you have to maybe add a

776
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
some sometimes you have to maybe add a
 

777
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,310
some sometimes you have to maybe add a
couple

778
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
couple
 

779
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,550
couple
indices and see that that always

780
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
indices and see that that always
 

781
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,829
indices and see that that always
increases because

782
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
increases because
 

783
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,670
increases because
one may stay the same while the other

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
one may stay the same while the other
 

785
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,910
one may stay the same while the other
increases or something like that

increases or something like that
 

787
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,870
increases or something like that
but in general as long as you argue that

788
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
but in general as long as you argue that
 

789
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,430
but in general as long as you argue that
the relations are acyclic

790
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
the relations are acyclic
 

791
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,189
the relations are acyclic
then the subproblem graph is a dag and

792
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
then the subproblem graph is a dag and
 

793
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,069
then the subproblem graph is a dag and
you can compute in a bottom-up manner

794
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
you can compute in a bottom-up manner
 

795
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,910
you can compute in a bottom-up manner
and you don't get infinite loops in your

796
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
and you don't get infinite loops in your
 

797
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,829
and you don't get infinite loops in your
recursion right

798
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
recursion right
 

799
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,310
recursion right
okay the last thing uh the last couple

800
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
okay the last thing uh the last couple
 

801
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,150
okay the last thing uh the last couple
things are kind of bookkeeping

802
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
things are kind of bookkeeping
 

803
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,670
things are kind of bookkeeping
but if you don't write these on your

804
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
but if you don't write these on your
 

805
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,990
but if you don't write these on your
exam we can't give you points for them

806
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
exam we can't give you points for them
 

807
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,670
exam we can't give you points for them
so write these down uh base cases

808
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
so write these down uh base cases
 

809
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,310
so write these down uh base cases
if if you don't tell us base cases then

810
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
if if you don't tell us base cases then
 

811
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,150
if if you don't tell us base cases then
your algorithm cannot be

812
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
your algorithm cannot be
 

813
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,990
your algorithm cannot be
polynomial time it can't even be pi

814
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
polynomial time it can't even be pi
 

815
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,829
polynomial time it can't even be pi
finite time because your algorithm never

816
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
finite time because your algorithm never
 

817
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,870
finite time because your algorithm never
stops

818
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
stops
 

819
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,710
stops
right it just continues to recurse

820
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
right it just continues to recurse
 

821
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,550
right it just continues to recurse
forever and ever and ever

822
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
forever and ever and ever
 

823
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,550
forever and ever and ever
and so it's hard to give us points i

824
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
and so it's hard to give us points i
 

825
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,230
and so it's hard to give us points i
mean we will give you some points

826
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
mean we will give you some points
 

827
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,389
mean we will give you some points
if your sub problems in relation are

828
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
if your sub problems in relation are
 

829
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,430
if your sub problems in relation are
correct but

830
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
correct but
 

831
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,069
correct but
really if you write code without a base

832
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
really if you write code without a base
 

833
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,710
really if you write code without a base
case

834
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
case
 

835
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,189
case
it's going to be wrong right so base

836
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
it's going to be wrong right so base
 

837
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:17,990
it's going to be wrong right so base
cases are

838
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
cases are
 

839
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,670
cases are
really important basically for any

840
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
really important basically for any
 

841
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,509
really important basically for any
anything at the bounds of your

you're just summing the work done

1018
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
you're just summing the work done
 

1019
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,750
you're just summing the work done
by each sub problem because the

1020
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
by each sub problem because the
 

1021
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,350
by each sub problem because the
assumption is you're calculating all of

1022
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
assumption is you're calculating all of
 

1023
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,150
assumption is you're calculating all of
the sub problems you described to me

1024
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,160
the sub problems you described to me
 

1025
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,789
the sub problems you described to me
uh and but but if the work per

1026
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799
uh and but but if the work per
 

1027
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,870
uh and but but if the work per
subproblem is bounded by

1028
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
subproblem is bounded by
 

1029
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,029
subproblem is bounded by
the same value you can just multiply it

1030
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
the same value you can just multiply it
 

1031
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,310
the same value you can just multiply it
out right so that's

1032
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
out right so that's
 

1033
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,350
out right so that's
that's generally a a weaker bound but

1034
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
that's generally a a weaker bound but
 

1035
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,909
that's generally a a weaker bound but
usually asymptotically equivalent to the

1036
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
usually asymptotically equivalent to the
 

1037
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,870
usually asymptotically equivalent to the
stronger

1038
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
stronger
 

1039
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,110

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
uh notion on the left uh
 

1041
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,110
uh notion on the left uh
and and that's basically how you do

1042
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
and and that's basically how you do
 

1043
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,029
and and that's basically how you do
running time usually

1044

it's enough to how do i define to

1046
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
it's enough to how do i define to
 

1047
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,510
it's enough to how do i define to
determine

1048
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
determine
 

1049
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,750
determine
how many sub problems i have well i look

1050
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
how many sub problems i have well i look
 

1051
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,669
how many sub problems i have well i look
at the possible values of each of my

1052
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
at the possible values of each of my
 

1053
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,750
at the possible values of each of my
parameters

1054
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
parameters
 

1055
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,110
parameters
and then i multiply those numbers

1056
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
and then i multiply those numbers
 

1057
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,950
and then i multiply those numbers
together right a lot of people will

1058
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
together right a lot of people will
 

1059
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,270
together right a lot of people will
maybe say oh i add them together

1060
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
maybe say oh i add them together
 

1061
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,270
maybe say oh i add them together
no because i'm able to choose each of

1062
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
no because i'm able to choose each of
 

1063
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,630
no because i'm able to choose each of
these independently

1064
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
these independently
 

1065
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,789
these independently
and so i multiply those things together

1066
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
and so i multiply those things together
 

1067
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,830
and so i multiply those things together
and then

1068
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
and then
 

1069
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,830
and then
the the work done by each sum problem is

1070
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
the the work done by each sum problem is
 

1071
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,630
the the work done by each sum problem is
usually

1072
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
usually
 

1073
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,549
usually
the size of the thing i'm maximizing

1074
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559

summing in my relation right it's going

1078
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
summing in my relation right it's going
 

1079
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,710
summing in my relation right it's going
to be the size of that

1080
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
to be the size of that
 

1081
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,390

the branching that i have the number of

1082
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
the branching that i have the number of
 

1083
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,909
the branching that i have the number of
sub problems i depend on

1084

sub problems i depend on
 

1085
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,710
sub problems i depend on
and so the number of subproblems you

1086
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
and so the number of subproblems you
 

1087
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,669
and so the number of subproblems you
probably look at your

1088
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
probably look at your
 

1089
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,470
probably look at your
sub problem statement definition to find

1090
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480

1093
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,710
the work done
by each subproblem you look at your

1094
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
by each subproblem you look at your
 

1095
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,830
by each subproblem you look at your
recursive relation okay

1096
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
recursive relation okay
 

1097
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,549
recursive relation okay
so with that we've got this really nice

1098
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
so with that we've got this really nice
 

1099

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,750

was actually

1140
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
was actually

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,190

i think it's the second back to the

um anyway tiffany wants to use this

information to make money because she

1148
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
information to make money because she
 

1149
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,070
information to make money because she
knows the future about the lottery

knows the future about the lottery
 

1151
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,909
knows the future about the lottery
but is worried that if she plays winning

1152
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
but is worried that if she plays winning
 

1153

1155
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,909

will get suspicious and shut her down

1156
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
will get suspicious and shut her down
 

1157
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,909
will get suspicious and shut her down
right so the idea here is

1158
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
right so the idea here is
 

1159
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,470
right so the idea here is
maybe it's still suspicious but decides

1160
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
maybe it's still suspicious but decides
 

1161
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,470
maybe it's still suspicious but decides

uh it's infrequent enough that eh maybe

uh it's infrequent enough that eh maybe

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
this was
 

1183
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,470
this was
a particularly difficult type of pset

1184
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
a particularly difficult type of pset
 

1185
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,430
a particularly difficult type of pset
uh or first pset on dynamic programming

1186
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
uh or first pset on dynamic programming
 

1187
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,390
uh or first pset on dynamic programming
problem but let's try to do it together

1188
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
problem but let's try to do it together
 

1189
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,350
problem but let's try to do it together
so this is problem one i'm gonna just

1190
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
so this is problem one i'm gonna just
 

1191
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,750
so this is problem one i'm gonna just
call it lotto

1192
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
call it lotto
 

1193
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,990
call it lotto
okay so how can we

1194
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
okay so how can we
 

1195
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,470
okay so how can we
deal with subproblems here well i might

1196
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,480
deal with subproblems here well i might
 

1197
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,230
deal with subproblems here well i might
wanna think about

1198
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
wanna think about
 

1199
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,270
wanna think about
what do i do on the first day

1200
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
what do i do on the first day
 

1201
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,029
what do i do on the first day
am i going to play the lottery or not

1202
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
am i going to play the lottery or not
 

1203
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,190
am i going to play the lottery or not
and then recurse on the rest

1204
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
and then recurse on the rest
 

1205
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,029
and then recurse on the rest
that sounds good right so some i might

1206
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
that sounds good right so some i might
 

1207
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,630
that sounds good right so some i might
have something like

1208
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
have something like
 

1209
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,950
have something like
uh well let's say that l of i

1210
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
uh well let's say that l of i
 

1211
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,549
uh well let's say that l of i
is the uh winnings

1212
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559

 

1213
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,590

on day i

1214
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
on day i
 

1215
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,710
on day i
this is kind of just like i this doesn't

1216
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
this is kind of just like i this doesn't
 

1217
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,950
this is kind of just like i this doesn't
define me some notation on what the cash

1218
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
define me some notation on what the cash
 

1219
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,390
define me some notation on what the cash
payouts are and so i'm

1220
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
payouts are and so i'm
 

1221
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,830
payouts are and so i'm
making a variable to do that and

1222
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
making a variable to do that and
 

1223
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,430
making a variable to do that and
for the sake of what's written down on

1224
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,440
for the sake of what's written down on
 

1225
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,470
for the sake of what's written down on
my sheet i'm going to assume that these

1226
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
my sheet i'm going to assume that these
 

1227
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,830
my sheet i'm going to assume that these
is one indexed i don't know why

1228
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
is one indexed i don't know why
 

1229
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,990
is one indexed i don't know why
okay okay so i have days one to n

1230
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
okay okay so i have days one to n
 

1231
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,789
okay okay so i have days one to n
i know what their lottery payouts are so

1232
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
i know what their lottery payouts are so
 

1233
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,190
i know what their lottery payouts are so
i might when i'm doing my sort bot stuff

1234
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
i might when i'm doing my sort bot stuff
 

1235
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,990
i might when i'm doing my sort bot stuff
i have

1236
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
i have
 

1237
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,350
i have
sub problems right what i might want to

1238
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
sub problems right what i might want to
 

1239
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,750
sub problems right what i might want to
do

1240
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
do
 

1241
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,110
do
is see what happens on day one and

1242
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
is see what happens on day one and
 

1243
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,710
is see what happens on day one and
recurse on what's later

1244
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
recurse on what's later
 

1245
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,390
recurse on what's later
so i might have something like x of i

1246
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
so i might have something like x of i
 

1247
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,310
so i might have something like x of i
is max winnings

1248
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320

 

1249
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,950

uh for i guess possible

1250
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:58,960

 

1251
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,710

for days i

1252
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
for days i
 

1253
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,789
for days i
to n okay anyone have a problem with

1254
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
to n okay anyone have a problem with
 

1255
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,669
to n okay anyone have a problem with
this

1256
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
this
 

1257
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,390
this
type of sub problem let's see let's kind

1258
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
type of sub problem let's see let's kind
 

1259
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,110
type of sub problem let's see let's kind
of

1260
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
of
 

1261
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,310
of
see what this type of sub problem would

1262
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
see what this type of sub problem would
 

1263
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,990
see what this type of sub problem would
lead me to

1264
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000

 

1265
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,990

i can either in my relate step

1266
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
i can either in my relate step
 

1267
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,830
i can either in my relate step
what are my choices i can either play on

1268
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
what are my choices i can either play on
 

1269
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,029
what are my choices i can either play on
day i

1270
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039
day i
 

1271
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,990
day i
or i cannot play on day i right if i

1272
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000

 

1273
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,830

i'm i'm trying to maximize this thing

1274
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840
i'm i'm trying to maximize this thing
 

1275
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,230
i'm i'm trying to maximize this thing
maximize

1276
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
maximize
 

1277
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,750
maximize
either if i play on day i get

1278
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
either if i play on day i get
 

1279
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,990
either if i play on day i get
l i and then i can recurse on the

1280
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
l i and then i can recurse on the
 

1281
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,990
l i and then i can recurse on the
remainder

1282
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
remainder
 

1283
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,310
remainder
or i don't play on l i and i recurse on

1284
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,320
or i don't play on l i and i recurse on
 

1285
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,070
or i don't play on l i and i recurse on
the remainder

1286
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
the remainder
 

1287
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,029
the remainder
anyone like this recurrence why don't we

1288
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
anyone like this recurrence why don't we
 

1289
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,909
anyone like this recurrence why don't we
like this recurrence

1290
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
like this recurrence
 

1291
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,149
like this recurrence
i'm just always going to pick this thing

1292
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
i'm just always going to pick this thing
 

1293
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,830
i'm just always going to pick this thing
these things are always positive i think

1294
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
these things are always positive i think
 

1295
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,470
these things are always positive i think
it's just positive integer payouts yeah

1296
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
it's just positive integer payouts yeah
 

1297
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,789
it's just positive integer payouts yeah
and so i'm always going to pick li and

1298
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
and so i'm always going to pick li and
 

1299
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,390
and so i'm always going to pick li and
the problem here is that it's not

1300
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
the problem here is that it's not
 

1301
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,950
the problem here is that it's not
obeying or dealing with this condition

1302
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
obeying or dealing with this condition
 

1303
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,830
obeying or dealing with this condition
that i have

1304
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
that i have
 

1305
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,669
that i have
which is i'm only allowed to play twice

1306
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
which is i'm only allowed to play twice
 

1307
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,510
which is i'm only allowed to play twice
a week or not

1308
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
a week or not
 

1309
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,990
a week or not
not quite twice a week it's not a fixed

1310
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
not quite twice a week it's not a fixed
 

1311
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,430
not quite twice a week it's not a fixed
week-long period

1312
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
week-long period
 

1313
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,470
week-long period
it's within any consecutive seven-day

1314
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
it's within any consecutive seven-day
 

1315
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,590
it's within any consecutive seven-day
period which is a little confusing

1316
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
period which is a little confusing
 

1317
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,110
period which is a little confusing
how can i remember what days i'm allowed

1318
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120
how can i remember what days i'm allowed
 

1319
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,510
how can i remember what days i'm allowed
to pick later on it seems

1320
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
to pick later on it seems
 

1321
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,510
to pick later on it seems
a little daunting okay

1322
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
a little daunting okay
 

1323
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,070
a little daunting okay
in a sense for me to know right like

1324
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
in a sense for me to know right like
 

1325
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,549
in a sense for me to know right like
this is

1326
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
this is
 

1327
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,750
this is
max winning possible for days i to n but

1328
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
max winning possible for days i to n but
 

1329
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,789
max winning possible for days i to n but
in some sense it depends on

1330
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
in some sense it depends on
 

1331
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,029
in some sense it depends on
which days i picked before right because

1332
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,039
which days i picked before right because
 

1333
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,549
which days i picked before right because
if i picked i

1334
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
if i picked i
 

1335
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,230
if i picked i
minus one right i can't

1336
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
minus one right i can't
 

1337
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,029
minus one right i can't
pick another day for another six days

1338
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
pick another day for another six days
 

1339
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,190
pick another day for another six days
right if i have uh

1340
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200

 

1341
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,870

right so i have let's do this precisely

1342
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
right so i have let's do this precisely
 

1343
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,990
right so i have let's do this precisely
this is i minus one

1344
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
this is i minus one
 

1345
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,870
this is i minus one
right i have seven day period one two

1346
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
right i have seven day period one two
 

1347
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,350
right i have seven day period one two
three

1348
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,360
three
 

1349
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,470
three
four five six seven

1350
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
four five six seven
 

1351
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,669
four five six seven
right if i uh

1352
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
right if i uh
 

1353
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,029
right if i uh
played the lottery here and i played the

1354
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
played the lottery here and i played the
 

1355
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,710
played the lottery here and i played the
lottery here

1356
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
lottery here
 

1357
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,230
lottery here
then i'm not allowed to play the lottery

1358
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
then i'm not allowed to play the lottery
 

1359
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,590
then i'm not allowed to play the lottery
here i'm not allowed to play here not

1360
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:19,600
here i'm not allowed to play here not
 

1361
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,870
here i'm not allowed to play here not
allowed to play here not allowed to play

1362
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
allowed to play here not allowed to play
 

1363
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,750
allowed to play here not allowed to play
here

1364
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
here
 

1365
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,830
here
not allowed to play here i am allowed to

1366
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
not allowed to play here i am allowed to
 

1367
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,470
not allowed to play here i am allowed to
play here

1368
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480

 

1369
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,909

right so this is i plus 1 plus 2 plus 3

1370
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
right so this is i plus 1 plus 2 plus 3
 

1371
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,430
right so this is i plus 1 plus 2 plus 3
plus 4 plus 5 plus 6

1372
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,440
plus 4 plus 5 plus 6
 

1373
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,269
plus 4 plus 5 plus 6
i plus 6.

1374
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279

 

1375
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,909

so depending on what happened before me

1376
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
so depending on what happened before me
 

1377
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,950
so depending on what happened before me
i might not be able to play until day i

1378
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
i might not be able to play until day i
 

1379
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,149
i might not be able to play until day i
plus six

1380
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
plus six
 

1381
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,510
plus six
but if i haven't played until since like

1382
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
but if i haven't played until since like
 

1383
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,110
but if i haven't played until since like
way back here i could potentially play

1384
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,120
way back here i could potentially play
 

1385
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,070
way back here i could potentially play
the next guy i don't actually know which

1386
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
the next guy i don't actually know which
 

1387
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,070
the next guy i don't actually know which
of these i can play on next

1388
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
of these i can play on next
 

1389
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,870
of these i can play on next
in some sense i need to remember which

1390
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
in some sense i need to remember which
 

1391
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,510
in some sense i need to remember which
days

1392
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
days
 

1393
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,830
days
i'm allowed to play on next and i want

1394
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
i'm allowed to play on next and i want
 

1395
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,750
i'm allowed to play on next and i want
to be able to jet like at the beginning

1396
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
to be able to jet like at the beginning
 

1397
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,669
to be able to jet like at the beginning
i have no restrictions i can i can just

1398
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
i have no restrictions i can i can just
 

1399
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,110
i have no restrictions i can i can just
play on this guy

1400
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
play on this guy
 

1401
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,190
play on this guy
next even if i if i played there

1402
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
next even if i if i played there
 

1403
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,590
next even if i if i played there
but in general i need i i will be

1404
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
but in general i need i i will be
 

1405
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,430
but in general i need i i will be
restricted in some way

1406
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,440
restricted in some way
 

1407
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,669
restricted in some way
between being able to play on this guy

1408
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
between being able to play on this guy
 

1409
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,269
between being able to play on this guy
and being able to play on this one guy

1410
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
and being able to play on this one guy
 

1411
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,390
and being able to play on this one guy
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going

1412
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going
 

1413
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,789
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going
to generalize my sub problems

1414
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
to generalize my sub problems
 

1415
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,110
to generalize my sub problems
by storing additional information so

1416
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,120
by storing additional information so
 

1417
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,470
by storing additional information so
that i can

1418
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
that i can
 

1419
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,710
that i can
rely on that information when i look

1420
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
rely on that information when i look
 

1421
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,669
rely on that information when i look
into the future

1422
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
into the future
 

1423
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,510
into the future
and recurse okay so instead of

1424
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
and recurse okay so instead of
 

1425
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,390
and recurse okay so instead of
uh i'm going to in some sense need to

1426
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
uh i'm going to in some sense need to
 

1427
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,669
uh i'm going to in some sense need to
remember

1428
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
remember
 

1429
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,590
remember
two days right

1430
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
two days right
 

1431
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,470
two days right
where was the last two places i played

1432
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
where was the last two places i played
 

1433
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,070
where was the last two places i played
i'm going to simplify that a little bit

1434
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
i'm going to simplify that a little bit
 

1435
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,430
i'm going to simplify that a little bit
by saying that

1436
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
by saying that
 

1437
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,830
by saying that
this sub problem max winnings possible

1438
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:49,840
this sub problem max winnings possible
 

1439
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,470
this sub problem max winnings possible
for days

1440
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,480
for days
 

1441
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,510
for days
i to n i'm going to

1442
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
i to n i'm going to
 

1443
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,870
i to n i'm going to
say that i have to play on day i okay

1444
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
say that i have to play on day i okay
 

1445
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,190
say that i have to play on day i okay
similar restriction as longest

1446
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
similar restriction as longest
 

1447
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,710
similar restriction as longest
increasing subsequence right

1448
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
increasing subsequence right
 

1449
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,549
increasing subsequence right
i'm definitely including this in my

1450
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
i'm definitely including this in my
 

1451
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,149
i'm definitely including this in my
subsequence that's just going to make it

1452
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:04,159
subsequence that's just going to make it
 

1453
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:04,710
subsequence that's just going to make it
easier

1454
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
easier
 

1455
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,830
easier
for me to be like oh i definitely know i

1456
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
for me to be like oh i definitely know i
 

1457
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,350
for me to be like oh i definitely know i
played on this day

1458
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
played on this day
 

1459
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,950
played on this day
right it's going to be make it easier

1460
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
right it's going to be make it easier
 

1461
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,110
right it's going to be make it easier
for my thinking so

1462
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
for my thinking so
 

1463
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,830
for my thinking so
assuming play

1464
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:17,840
assuming play
 

1465
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,669
assuming play
on day i

1466
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
on day i
 

1467
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,470
on day i
and actually i need to remember what's

1468
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
and actually i need to remember what's
 

1469
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,590
and actually i need to remember what's
the next day i can play

1470
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
the next day i can play
 

1471
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,870
the next day i can play
okay so i'm going to expand this sub

1472
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
okay so i'm going to expand this sub
 

1473
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,750
okay so i'm going to expand this sub
problem by

1474
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:31,760
problem by
 

1475
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,510
problem by
another i guess this is a j

1476
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
another i guess this is a j
 

1477
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,750
another i guess this is a j
okay assuming i play on day i

1478
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760
okay assuming i play on day i
 

1479
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,149
okay assuming i play on day i
and i'm allowed to play

1480
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159

 

1481
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,190

uh i guessed and next

1482
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
uh i guessed and next
 

1483
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,789
uh i guessed and next
allowable

1484
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799

 

1485
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,070

play on

1486
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
play on
 

1487
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,870
play on
day i plus j

1488
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
day i plus j
 

1489
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,510
day i plus j
for

1490
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:05,520

 

1491
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,430

what are my possible range of days for

1492
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
what are my possible range of days for
 

1493
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,909
what are my possible range of days for
jay

1494
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:09,919

 

1495
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,990

i can either play the next day

1496
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,000
i can either play the next day
 

1497
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,430
i can either play the next day
but i never restricted past day i plus

1498
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
but i never restricted past day i plus
 

1499
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,630
but i never restricted past day i plus
six right because

1500
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,640
six right because
 

1501
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,310
six right because
the things before me further to the

1502
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
the things before me further to the
 

1503
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,750
the things before me further to the
right because i haven't dealt with them

1504
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
right because i haven't dealt with them
 

1505
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,789
right because i haven't dealt with them
yet right so

1506
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:24,799
yet right so
 

1507
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,190
yet right so
i only have to deal with this from one

1508
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,200
i only have to deal with this from one
 

1509
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,430
i only have to deal with this from one
to six

1510
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
to six
 

1511
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,590
to six
well this is nice because it expanded my

1512
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
well this is nice because it expanded my
 

1513
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,070
well this is nice because it expanded my
sub problems by a constant number

1514
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,080
sub problems by a constant number
 

1515
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,389
sub problems by a constant number
right so i actually didn't lose anything

1516
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:36,399
right so i actually didn't lose anything
 

1517
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,269
right so i actually didn't lose anything
asymptotically

1518
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:37,279
asymptotically
 

1519
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,070
asymptotically
by remembering this information but i'm

1520
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
by remembering this information but i'm
 

1521
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,630
by remembering this information but i'm
kind of

1522
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:40,640
kind of
 

1523
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,830
kind of
i'm able to remember all the things that

1524
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:43,840
i'm able to remember all the things that
 

1525
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,430
i'm able to remember all the things that
could have happened before me

1526
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:45,440
could have happened before me
 

1527
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,190
could have happened before me
i compress it into this one number okay

1528
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
i compress it into this one number okay
 

1529
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,230
i compress it into this one number okay
so

1530
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240

 

1531
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,990

now let's rewrite our relation i'm

1532
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
now let's rewrite our relation i'm
 

1533
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,269
now let's rewrite our relation i'm
actually going to

1534
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
actually going to
 

1535
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,990
actually going to
go ahead and use some more board space

1536
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
go ahead and use some more board space
 

1537
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,269
go ahead and use some more board space
because

1538
00:28:59,269 --> 00:28:59,279
because
 

1539
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:05,669
because
i think that's easier than erasing

1540
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679

 

1541
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,070

all right so we're looking at my

1542
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
all right so we're looking at my
 

1543
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,950
all right so we're looking at my
relation

1544
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
relation
 

1545
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,710
relation
this is a pretty complicated relation

1546
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
this is a pretty complicated relation
 

1547
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,029
this is a pretty complicated relation
but what's happening now now

1548
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
but what's happening now now
 

1549
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,230
but what's happening now now
uh i'm assuming i play on day i

1550
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,240
uh i'm assuming i play on day i
 

1551
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,830
uh i'm assuming i play on day i
that actually simplifies things a little

1552
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
that actually simplifies things a little
 

1553
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,070
that actually simplifies things a little
bit because no matter what

1554
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
bit because no matter what
 

1555
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,430
bit because no matter what
i get the winnings on day i okay

1556
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
i get the winnings on day i okay
 

1557
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,070
i get the winnings on day i okay
now when i call this sub problem i

1558
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
now when i call this sub problem i
 

1559
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,750
now when i call this sub problem i
better make sure that it's okay that i

1560
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
better make sure that it's okay that i
 

1561
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,870
better make sure that it's okay that i
played on day i

1562
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
played on day i
 

1563
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,909
played on day i
but that's that's for my caller right i

1564
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
but that's that's for my caller right i
 

1565
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,590
but that's that's for my caller right i
am locally allowed to play on day i am

1566
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
am locally allowed to play on day i am
 

1567
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,029
am locally allowed to play on day i am
playing on day out right

1568
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,039
playing on day out right
 

1569
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,510
playing on day out right
that's the definition of my sub problem

1570
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
that's the definition of my sub problem
 

1571
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,549
that's the definition of my sub problem
so

1572
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:38,559
so
 

1573
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,190
so
x of i is i'm going to maximize over

1574
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
x of i is i'm going to maximize over
 

1575
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,710
x of i is i'm going to maximize over
some choice right max

1576
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720

 

1577
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,029

of i guess i have l i no matter what

1578
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:53,039
of i guess i have l i no matter what
 

1579
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,710
of i guess i have l i no matter what
so this could actually come out of my

1580
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
so this could actually come out of my
 

1581
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,149
so this could actually come out of my
max

1582
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
max
 

1583
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,669
max
and then i'm going to choose what am i

1584
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
and then i'm going to choose what am i
 

1585
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,950
and then i'm going to choose what am i
choosing here i'm not choosing whether

1586
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
choosing here i'm not choosing whether
 

1587
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,789
choosing here i'm not choosing whether
i'm playing on day i

1588
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
i'm playing on day i
 

1589
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,430
i'm playing on day i
i'm choosing what my next day i play is

1590
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,440
i'm choosing what my next day i play is
 

1591
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,269
i'm choosing what my next day i play is
so that then i can recurse on that sub

1592
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
so that then i can recurse on that sub
 

1593
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,750
so that then i can recurse on that sub
problem

1594
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760

 

1595
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,110

so what day can i play on well i'm kind

1596
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,120
so what day can i play on well i'm kind
 

1597
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,470
so what day can i play on well i'm kind
of restricted

1598
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480

 

1599
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,630

by this j parameter that i didn't add

1600
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,640
by this j parameter that i didn't add
 

1601
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,830
by this j parameter that i didn't add
into my sub problem

1602
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,840

 

1603
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,549

on what possible days i can play next

1604
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
on what possible days i can play next
 

1605
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,190
on what possible days i can play next
right

1606
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,200
right
 

1607
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,470
right
i'm going to split that into a

1608
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
i'm going to split that into a
 

1609
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,750
i'm going to split that into a
kind of compress that into one thing

1610
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
kind of compress that into one thing
 

1611
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,830
kind of compress that into one thing
so x i can

1612
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
so x i can
 

1613
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,029
so x i can
play on i have a choice of

1614
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:37,039
play on i have a choice of
 

1615
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,710
play on i have a choice of
the next day i play somewhere between

1616
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:40,720
the next day i play somewhere between
 

1617
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,789
the next day i play somewhere between
j which is my next allowable play and

1618
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:42,799
j which is my next allowable play and
 

1619
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,549
j which is my next allowable play and
sometime in the future

1620
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559
sometime in the future
 

1621
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,669
sometime in the future
right so i plus

1622
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
right so i plus
 

1623
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,470
right so i plus
k this is going to be my loop that i'm

1624
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
k this is going to be my loop that i'm
 

1625
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,310
k this is going to be my loop that i'm
looping over in terms of my max

1626
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320

 

1627
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,350

and then what am i restricted on

1628
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
and then what am i restricted on
 

1629
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,029
and then what am i restricted on
in my play right it depends on

1630
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
in my play right it depends on
 

1631
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,230
in my play right it depends on
how far i am from i right

1632
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:04,240
how far i am from i right
 

1633
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,389
how far i am from i right
so if i'm here

1634
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399

 

1635
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,430

this is i if i choose k

1636
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:11,440
this is i if i choose k
 

1637
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,430
this is i if i choose k
to be the next day i can't play

1638
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
to be the next day i can't play
 

1639
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,549
to be the next day i can't play
for many many times so

1640
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
for many many times so
 

1641
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,549
for many many times so
like the sub problem i'm going to

1642
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
like the sub problem i'm going to
 

1643
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,909
like the sub problem i'm going to
rehearse on

1644
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
rehearse on
 

1645
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,830
rehearse on
is uh this is

1646
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:25,840
is uh this is
 

1647
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,190
is uh this is
i plus k i'm going to recurse on i

1648
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
i plus k i'm going to recurse on i
 

1649
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,549
i plus k i'm going to recurse on i
plus k but i'm not

1650
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559
plus k but i'm not
 

1651
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,549
plus k but i'm not
able to j needs to be the max it can be

1652
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
able to j needs to be the max it can be
 

1653
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,669
able to j needs to be the max it can be
right because i can't play uh

1654
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
right because i can't play uh
 

1655
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,789
right because i can't play uh
until i plus six right so this i

1656
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:42,799
until i plus six right so this i
 

1657
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,430
until i plus six right so this i
plus k plus six is going to be my thing

1658
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
plus k plus six is going to be my thing
 

1659
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,350
plus k plus six is going to be my thing
so

1660
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,360

 

1661
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,149

let's see so i'm going to put

1662
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159

 

1663
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,909

let's see if i can unpack what i wrote

1664
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
let's see if i can unpack what i wrote
 

1665
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,590
let's see if i can unpack what i wrote
down here

1666
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
down here
 

1667
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,070
down here
max of 1 7 minus k

1668
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,080
max of 1 7 minus k
 

1669
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,590
max of 1 7 minus k
yuck

1670
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,600

 

1671
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,710

oh i'll put it here

1672
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720

 

1673
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,230

1 7 minus k okay if i

1674
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:14,240
1 7 minus k okay if i
 

1675
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,789
1 7 minus k okay if i
if i pick k

1676
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799

 

1677
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,470

i'm not aggressive as toward these

1678
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
i'm not aggressive as toward these
 

1679
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,310
i'm not aggressive as toward these
boards as justin is

1680
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320
boards as justin is
 

1681
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,230
boards as justin is
um okay so

1682
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,240
um okay so
 

1683
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,830
um okay so
if i get if i pick a way down here

1684
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:31,840
if i get if i pick a way down here
 

1685
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,389
if i get if i pick a way down here
right they're not restricted at all

1686
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:34,399
right they're not restricted at all
 

1687
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,509
right they're not restricted at all
right and so the

1688
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
right and so the
 

1689
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,149
right and so the
the most permissive option i have here

1690
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
the most permissive option i have here
 

1691
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:38,950
the most permissive option i have here
is one

1692
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
is one
 

1693
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,630
is one
right so i definitely can't be worse

1694
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
right so i definitely can't be worse
 

1695
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,549
right so i definitely can't be worse
than one right

1696
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
than one right
 

1697
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,350
than one right
but if i pick uh

1698
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360

 

1699
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,029

and then this needs to be some number

1700
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:49,039
and then this needs to be some number
 

1701
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,789
and then this needs to be some number
between

1702
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
between
 

1703
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,990
between
six and one right and so i can just

1704
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
six and one right and so i can just
 

1705
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,669
six and one right and so i can just
check the other bound right

1706
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:55,679
check the other bound right
 

1707
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,350
check the other bound right
if this is the most restrictive right

1708
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,360
if this is the most restrictive right
 

1709
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,789
if this is the most restrictive right
then this should be uh six

1710
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
then this should be uh six
 

1711
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,950
then this should be uh six
right so when k equals one this should

1712
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:04,960
right so when k equals one this should
 

1713
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,789
right so when k equals one this should
be six and it decreases

1714
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
be six and it decreases
 

1715
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,830
be six and it decreases
every time further back or further

1716
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840
every time further back or further
 

1717
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,590
every time further back or further
forward i choose this k

1718
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
forward i choose this k
 

1719
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,909
forward i choose this k
right so that's what my sub problem is

1720
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:13,919
right so that's what my sub problem is
 

1721
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,350
right so that's what my sub problem is
going to be

1722
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
going to be
 

1723
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,710
going to be
and i'm choosing over k

1724
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:18,720
and i'm choosing over k
 

1725
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,750
and i'm choosing over k
in uh from j

1726
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
in uh from j
 

1727
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,909
in uh from j
j uh sorry i plus j

1728
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:25,919
j uh sorry i plus j
 

1729
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,430
j uh sorry i plus j
so sorry j thank you

1730
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,440

 

1731
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,590

until what

1732
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:33,600

 

1733
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,230

that's the question until what do i have

1734
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
that's the question until what do i have
 

1735
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,710
that's the question until what do i have
to

1736
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:36,720
to
 

1737
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,710
to
loop over n if i loop over and i'm going

1738
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:38,720
loop over n if i loop over and i'm going
 

1739
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,470
loop over n if i loop over and i'm going
to get a quadratic running time

1740
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480
to get a quadratic running time
 

1741
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,230
to get a quadratic running time
which is worse than what i'm allowed to

1742
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240
which is worse than what i'm allowed to
 

1743
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,509
which is worse than what i'm allowed to
do the assumption is

1744
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
do the assumption is
 

1745
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,950
do the assumption is
that i only have to check a constant

1746
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
that i only have to check a constant
 

1747
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,070
that i only have to check a constant
number of these and why might that be

1748
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,080
number of these and why might that be
 

1749
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,350
number of these and why might that be
any ideas let's say i'm

1750
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360

 

1751
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,909

got my sub problem i'm recursing i've

1752
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
got my sub problem i'm recursing i've
 

1753
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,509
got my sub problem i'm recursing i've
got i

1754
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
got i
 

1755
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,950
got i
yeah i don't know where j is j is

1756
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:02,960
yeah i don't know where j is j is
 

1757
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,950
yeah i don't know where j is j is
somewhere over here

1758
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
somewhere over here
 

1759
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,630
somewhere over here
one two three maybe it's four or

1760
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:06,640
one two three maybe it's four or
 

1761
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,109
one two three maybe it's four or
something like that

1762
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119

 

1763
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,270

let's say i pick some k down here what

1764
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,280
let's say i pick some k down here what
 

1765
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,310
let's say i pick some k down here what
is this this is i

1766
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
is this this is i
 

1767
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,669
is this this is i
plus so this is j is 4

1768
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:17,679
plus so this is j is 4
 

1769
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,990
plus so this is j is 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

1770
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,000
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
 

1771
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,470
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
15 way over here like two weeks later

1772
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:26,480
15 way over here like two weeks later
 

1773
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,909
15 way over here like two weeks later
is it ever optimal for me to do that

1774
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:29,919
is it ever optimal for me to do that
 

1775
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,310
is it ever optimal for me to do that
why not

1776
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,320
why not
 

1777
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,589
why not
yeah i could play the lotto in the

1778
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
yeah i could play the lotto in the
 

1779
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,829
yeah i could play the lotto in the
middle here right right i'm

1780
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
middle here right right i'm
 

1781
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,190
middle here right right i'm
i'm within seven like from here to there

1782
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
i'm within seven like from here to there
 

1783
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,230
i'm within seven like from here to there
that's a seven

1784
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,240
that's a seven
 

1785
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,710
that's a seven
where i only played once and from here

1786
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
where i only played once and from here
 

1787
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,230
where i only played once and from here
to here that's a seven day period where

1788
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
to here that's a seven day period where
 

1789
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,669
to here that's a seven day period where
i only played once

1790
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
i only played once
 

1791
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,990
i only played once
right so it's going to be more these are

1792
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,000
right so it's going to be more these are
 

1793
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,750
right so it's going to be more these are
positive values so it's going to be more

1794
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:51,760
positive values so it's going to be more
 

1795
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,349
positive values so it's going to be more
optimal for me to choose something in

1796
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
optimal for me to choose something in
 

1797
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,950
optimal for me to choose something in
here to play

1798
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:54,960
here to play
 

1799
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,310
here to play
right so how far i mean i could just use

1800
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
right so how far i mean i could just use
 

1801
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,870
right so how far i mean i could just use
15

1802
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:58,880
15
 

1803
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,589
15
that would satisfy right because i've

1804
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:01,599
that would satisfy right because i've
 

1805
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,190
that would satisfy right because i've
already argued to you that it's never

1806
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
already argued to you that it's never
 

1807
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,030
already argued to you that it's never
optimal to i can check this

1808
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,040
optimal to i can check this
 

1809
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,870
optimal to i can check this
it's not going to be optimal it's going

1810
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
it's not going to be optimal it's going
 

1811
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,630
it's not going to be optimal it's going
to be more optimal to play sometime over

1812
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:08,640
to be more optimal to play sometime over
 

1813
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,150
to be more optimal to play sometime over
here

1814
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,160
here
 

1815
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,150
here
right but how far do i have to check

1816
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160

 

1817
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,349

well maybe i have to check up to seven

1818
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
well maybe i have to check up to seven
 

1819
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,670
well maybe i have to check up to seven
does that work

1820
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680

 

1821
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,589

not quite so let's say i played here

1822
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:25,599
not quite so let's say i played here
 

1823
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,630
not quite so let's say i played here
and i played here

1824
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
and i played here
 

1825
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,030
and i played here
and i played here and i played here

1826
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,040
and i played here and i played here
 

1827
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,069
and i played here and i played here
right i actually

1828
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,079
right i actually
 

1829
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,349
right i actually
can't play here here here

1830
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
can't play here here here
 

1831
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,470
can't play here here here
here here right i'm not allowed to play

1832
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:42,480
here here right i'm not allowed to play
 

1833
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:42,790
here here right i'm not allowed to play
those

1834
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:42,800
those
 

1835
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,270
those
i guess these should be o's i played

1836
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,280
i guess these should be o's i played
 

1837
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,990
i guess these should be o's i played
there

1838
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,000

 

1839
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,310

and i'm not allowed to play here one two

1840
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
and i'm not allowed to play here one two
 

1841
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,510
and i'm not allowed to play here one two
three four

1842
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:51,520
three four
 

1843
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,270
three four
five right but i am allowed to play

1844
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,280
five right but i am allowed to play
 

1845
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,150
five right but i am allowed to play
anywhere in here

1846
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,160
anywhere in here
 

1847
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,710
anywhere in here
so i basically want to shrink this until

1848
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:58,720
so i basically want to shrink this until
 

1849
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,750
so i basically want to shrink this until
these x's

1850
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760

 

1851
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,390

collide with each other because then it

1852
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:04,400
collide with each other because then it
 

1853
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,310
collide with each other because then it
it's possible that an optimal solution

1854
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
it's possible that an optimal solution
 

1855
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,630
it's possible that an optimal solution
would require me to pick these two

1856
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,640
would require me to pick these two
 

1857
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,230
would require me to pick these two
and then require me to pick these two

1858
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
and then require me to pick these two
 

1859
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,069
and then require me to pick these two
way over there right

1860
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:12,079
way over there right
 

1861
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,710
way over there right
so this is 10 things in the middle i

1862
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
so this is 10 things in the middle i
 

1863
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,109
so this is 10 things in the middle i
only have to go up to at most 11.

1864
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:17,119
only have to go up to at most 11.
 

1865
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,230
only have to go up to at most 11.
okay it's 11.

1866
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,240
okay it's 11.
 

1867
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,349
okay it's 11.
now you could use any constant above 11

1868
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:23,359
now you could use any constant above 11
 

1869
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,870
now you could use any constant above 11
and get the same running time bound but

1870
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
and get the same running time bound but
 

1871
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,990
and get the same running time bound but
that's that's my analysis

1872
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000
that's that's my analysis
 

1873
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,270
that's that's my analysis
okay so we have our recursive relation

1874
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
okay so we have our recursive relation
 

1875
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,589
okay so we have our recursive relation
uh and so what am i doing i'm just

1876
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:35,599
uh and so what am i doing i'm just
 

1877
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,829
uh and so what am i doing i'm just
looping over my choices of next day to

1878
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
looping over my choices of next day to
 

1879
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,390
looping over my choices of next day to
play

1880
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
play
 

1881
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,150
play
i'm recursing on this thing where i

1882
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,160
i'm recursing on this thing where i
 

1883
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,710
i'm recursing on this thing where i
actually do play on that day

1884
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
actually do play on that day
 

1885
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,870
actually do play on that day
right but i'm remembering the

1886
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:44,880
right but i'm remembering the
 

1887
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,630
right but i'm remembering the
information about what i'm allowed to

1888
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:46,640
information about what i'm allowed to
 

1889
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,230
information about what i'm allowed to
play next

1890
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
play next
 

1891
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,190
play next
by limiting based on what my previous

1892
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
by limiting based on what my previous
 

1893
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,310
by limiting based on what my previous
value was

1894
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,320
value was
 

1895
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,550
value was
okay so that's the kind of key thing i'm

1896
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:54,560
okay so that's the kind of key thing i'm
 

1897
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,310
okay so that's the kind of key thing i'm
remembering something further in advance

1898
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,320
remembering something further in advance
 

1899
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,510
remembering something further in advance
or

1900
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:57,520
or
 

1901
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,589
or
i'm remembering what happened in the

1902
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
i'm remembering what happened in the
 

1903
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,550
i'm remembering what happened in the
past by

1904
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:00,560
past by
 

1905
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,150
past by
describing it as a restriction of

1906
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
describing it as a restriction of
 

1907
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,829
describing it as a restriction of
something in the future

1908
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:03,839
something in the future
 

1909
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,270
something in the future
okay so this was a pretty difficult

1910
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,280
okay so this was a pretty difficult
 

1911
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,670
okay so this was a pretty difficult
problem i think it was one of our first

1912
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:09,680
problem i think it was one of our first
 

1913
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,349
problem i think it was one of our first
dynamic programming problems on that

1914
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:11,359
dynamic programming problems on that
 

1915
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:11,750
dynamic programming problems on that
term

1916
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
term
 

1917
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,190
term
it was probably a little ambitious okay

1918
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,200

 

1919
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,710

yeah yes the recurrence goes up to 11

1920
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,720
yeah yes the recurrence goes up to 11
 

1921
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,430
yeah yes the recurrence goes up to 11
not ten

1922
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:21,440
not ten
 

1923
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,790
not ten
eleven okay uh

1924
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:24,800
eleven okay uh
 

1925
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,390
eleven okay uh
so we have our topological sort

1926
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,400
so we have our topological sort
 

1927
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,990
so we have our topological sort
what's a topological sort for these

1928
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
what's a topological sort for these
 

1929
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,950
what's a topological sort for these
subproblems anybody

1930
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:36,960
subproblems anybody
 

1931
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,630
subproblems anybody
k is always going to be a positive

1932
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
k is always going to be a positive
 

1933
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,870
k is always going to be a positive
number right because j goes from 1 to 6.

1934
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880
number right because j goes from 1 to 6.
 

1935
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,069
number right because j goes from 1 to 6.
so i'm always going to be increasing in

1936
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
so i'm always going to be increasing in
 

1937
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,069
so i'm always going to be increasing in
this first quantity right so

1938
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,079
this first quantity right so
 

1939
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,550
this first quantity right so
for x of i j

1940
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:54,560
for x of i j
 

1941
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,710
for x of i j
i always uh or

1942
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:58,720
i always uh or
 

1943
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,829
i always uh or
sorry depends

1944
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:02,839

 

1945
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,390

on strictly

1946
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,400
on strictly
 

1947
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,750
on strictly
larger

1948
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760

 

1949
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,950

i right so

1950
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:12,960
i right so
 

1951
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,030
i right so
this i when i call subproblems it always

1952
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,040
this i when i call subproblems it always
 

1953
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,270
this i when i call subproblems it always
calls subproblems with a larger eye

1954
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
calls subproblems with a larger eye
 

1955
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,270
calls subproblems with a larger eye
now this is a little weird because i

1956
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,280
now this is a little weird because i
 

1957
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,790
now this is a little weird because i
wanted me to depend on

1958
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
wanted me to depend on
 

1959
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,310
wanted me to depend on
smaller sub problems smaller

1960
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,320
smaller sub problems smaller
 

1961
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,310
smaller sub problems smaller
now it is smaller because i'm taking a

1962
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
now it is smaller because i'm taking a
 

1963
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,990
now it is smaller because i'm taking a
smaller suffix

1964
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
smaller suffix
 

1965
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,990
smaller suffix
but it's corresponding to using a larger

1966
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
but it's corresponding to using a larger
 

1967
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,109
but it's corresponding to using a larger
number

1968
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,119
number
 

1969
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,990
number
to me that's a little confusing but

1970
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
to me that's a little confusing but
 

1971
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,990
to me that's a little confusing but
that's okay because we're kind of

1972
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
that's okay because we're kind of
 

1973
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,069
that's okay because we're kind of
using things that are always

1974
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
using things that are always
 

1975
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,750
using things that are always
monotonically going in some direction

1976
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760
monotonically going in some direction
 

1977
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,030
monotonically going in some direction
so this is corresponding to a smaller

1978
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
so this is corresponding to a smaller
 

1979
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,990
so this is corresponding to a smaller
sub problem

1980
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,000
sub problem
 

1981
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,150
sub problem
in some some measure right it's the

1982
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,160
in some some measure right it's the
 

1983
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,589
in some some measure right it's the
number of elements

1984
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:49,599
number of elements
 

1985
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,750
number of elements
that we're actually recursing on in some

1986
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
that we're actually recursing on in some
 

1987
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,870
that we're actually recursing on in some
sense if we

1988
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:52,880
sense if we
 

1989
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,230
sense if we
wrote this as a prefix we would have

1990
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,240
wrote this as a prefix we would have
 

1991
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,430
wrote this as a prefix we would have
us depending on strictly smaller i

1992
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
us depending on strictly smaller i
 

1993
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,670
us depending on strictly smaller i
and that would be more natural in terms

1994
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:01,680
and that would be more natural in terms
 

1995
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,470
and that would be more natural in terms
of a recursing on smaller sub-problems

1996
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
of a recursing on smaller sub-problems
 

1997
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,230
of a recursing on smaller sub-problems
but i digress okay all right then

1998
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,240
but i digress okay all right then
 

1999
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,230
but i digress okay all right then
we have our original subproblem

2000
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
we have our original subproblem
 

2001
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,750
we have our original subproblem
i'm gonna i can't move this board

2002
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:15,760
i'm gonna i can't move this board
 

2003
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,829
i'm gonna i can't move this board
i'll just keep going because we have

2004
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:17,839
i'll just keep going because we have
 

2005
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,750
i'll just keep going because we have
lots of boards

2006
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:19,760
lots of boards
 

2007
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,589
lots of boards
okay our original subproblem now

2008
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:25,599

 

2009
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,950

what could i do i have to start

2010
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,960
what could i do i have to start
 

2011
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,030
what could i do i have to start
somewhere

2012
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,040
somewhere
 

2013
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,829
somewhere
right here my sub problems assume that

2014
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:31,839
right here my sub problems assume that
 

2015
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,109
right here my sub problems assume that
i'm starting at i

2016
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:33,119
i'm starting at i
 

2017
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,150
i'm starting at i
but i don't know where i start i could

2018
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,160
but i don't know where i start i could
 

2019
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,630
but i don't know where i start i could
start by taking the first element but i

2020
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:38,640
start by taking the first element but i
 

2021
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,670
start by taking the first element but i
might not

2022
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680
might not
 

2023
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,790
might not
so i could just take the max

2024
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800

 

2025
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,430

over all you know i

2026
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440

 

2027
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,829

overall i of x i

2028
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:54,839

 

2029
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,310

what

2030
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
what
 

2031
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,550
what
the first one i'm not restricted on what

2032
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
the first one i'm not restricted on what
 

2033
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,750
the first one i'm not restricted on what
i choose next

2034
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
i choose next
 

2035
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,630
i choose next
so what's the most permissive version of

2036
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:02,640
so what's the most permissive version of
 

2037
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,109
so what's the most permissive version of
jay

2038
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119

 

2039
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,790

one right i'm allowed to take the next

2040
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:08,800
one right i'm allowed to take the next
 

2041
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,670
one right i'm allowed to take the next
today

2042
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:09,680
today
 

2043
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,550
today
right so if i just take the max over all

2044
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
right so if i just take the max over all
 

2045
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,550
right so if i just take the max over all
of these sub problems

2046
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
of these sub problems
 

2047
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,230
of these sub problems
i'll get the solution now actually this

2048
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
i'll get the solution now actually this
 

2049
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,750
i'll get the solution now actually this
is a little bit more work than i need

2050
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:17,760
is a little bit more work than i need
 

2051
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,030
is a little bit more work than i need
this is looping over all

2052
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,040
this is looping over all
 

2053
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,309
this is looping over all
n right

2054
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:22,319
n right
 

2055
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,309
n right
it's definitely correct right because i

2056
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319
it's definitely correct right because i
 

2057
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,510
it's definitely correct right because i
have to start somewhere

2058
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
have to start somewhere
 

2059
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,150
have to start somewhere
but will i ever start after the first i

2060
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,160
but will i ever start after the first i
 

2061
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,550
but will i ever start after the first i
don't know seven

2062
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
don't know seven
 

2063
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,950
don't know seven
no right so i could just take this max

2064
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:32,960
no right so i could just take this max
 

2065
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,950
no right so i could just take this max
over the first some constant number

2066
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:34,960
over the first some constant number
 

2067
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,630
over the first some constant number
and that would be fine but that's okay

2068
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,640
and that would be fine but that's okay
 

2069
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,230
and that would be fine but that's okay
this is still smaller than the number of

2070
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,240
this is still smaller than the number of
 

2071
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,589
this is still smaller than the number of
subproblems that we have yeah

2072
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
subproblems that we have yeah
 

2073
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,670
subproblems that we have yeah
if i were being lazy during my exam and

2074
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
if i were being lazy during my exam and
 

2075
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,950
if i were being lazy during my exam and
i looked over jay

2076
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
i looked over jay
 

2077
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,030
i looked over jay
would that be correct if i looped over j

2078
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
would that be correct if i looped over j
 

2079
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,270
would that be correct if i looped over j
for every possible thing

2080
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
for every possible thing
 

2081
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,710
for every possible thing
took took the loop over this and j

2082
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
took took the loop over this and j
 

2083
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,109
took took the loop over this and j
yeah that would still be fine why not

2084
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
yeah that would still be fine why not
 

2085
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,230
yeah that would still be fine why not
it's just

2086
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
it's just
 

2087
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,190
it's just
less it's it's it's more restrictive of

2088
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,200
less it's it's it's more restrictive of
 

2089
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,470
less it's it's it's more restrictive of
sub problems

2090
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:02,480
sub problems
 

2091
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,230
sub problems
it will never be better to do that

2092
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,240
it will never be better to do that
 

2093
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,430
it will never be better to do that
but you could do that because it

2094
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,440
but you could do that because it
 

2095
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,349
but you could do that because it
wouldn't change your running time

2096
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:09,359
wouldn't change your running time
 

2097
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,589
wouldn't change your running time
uh could it change my running time if my

2098
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:11,599
uh could it change my running time if my
 

2099
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,670
uh could it change my running time if my
j accidentally moved too far

2100
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680

 

2101
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,790

well j is restricted to be one to six so

2102
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
well j is restricted to be one to six so
 

2103
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,270
well j is restricted to be one to six so
i'm not

2104
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,280
i'm not
 

2105
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,270
i'm not
i i don't i don't think so but in a

2106
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
i i don't i don't think so but in a
 

2107
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,950
i i don't i don't think so but in a
different problem in a different context

2108
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:22,960
different problem in a different context
 

2109
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,470
different problem in a different context
it could

2110
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
it could
 

2111
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,190
it could
okay so that's the original and then

2112
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,200
okay so that's the original and then
 

2113
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,790
okay so that's the original and then
time here

2114
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:30,800

 

2115
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,790

what do we got we have a linear number

2116
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:32,800
what do we got we have a linear number
 

2117
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,550
what do we got we have a linear number
of subproblems

2118
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560
of subproblems
 

2119
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,030
of subproblems
number of sub problems we've got uh

2120
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,040
number of sub problems we've got uh
 

2121
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,430
number of sub problems we've got uh
i actually like usually saying exactly

2122
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
i actually like usually saying exactly
 

2123
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,870
i actually like usually saying exactly
how many subproblems i have

2124
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:42,880
how many subproblems i have
 

2125
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,230
how many subproblems i have
oh we didn't do base case i missed bot

2126
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
oh we didn't do base case i missed bot
 

2127
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,510
oh we didn't do base case i missed bot
i missed my b

2128
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:51,520

 

2129
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,589

we'll do the original first and then the

2130
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:53,599
we'll do the original first and then the
 

2131
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,390
we'll do the original first and then the
base case okay

2132
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
base case okay
 

2133
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,870
base case okay
base case what do we have is our base

2134
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
base case what do we have is our base
 

2135
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,030
base case what do we have is our base
case here

2136
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
case here
 

2137
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,589
case here
well when i don't have anything to do

2138
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:03,599
well when i don't have anything to do
 

2139
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,309
well when i don't have anything to do
right

2140
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:04,319
right
 

2141
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,990
right
if i'm and actually

2142
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,000
if i'm and actually
 

2143
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,430
if i'm and actually
if i have this situation

2144
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:11,440
if i have this situation
 

2145
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,030
if i have this situation
for i equals

2146
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
for i equals
 

2147
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,390
for i equals
say n

2148
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:18,400
say n
 

2149
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,030
say n
right i've got my last thing

2150
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040

 

2151
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,109

i could potentially start looping over

2152
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:25,119
i could potentially start looping over
 

2153
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,950
i could potentially start looping over
sub problems that are negative

2154
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:26,960
sub problems that are negative
 

2155
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,750
sub problems that are negative
in terms of my index i'm not going to

2156
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
in terms of my index i'm not going to
 

2157
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,430
in terms of my index i'm not going to
want to do that there's a couple ways i

2158
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,440
want to do that there's a couple ways i
 

2159
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,309
want to do that there's a couple ways i
can deal with that

2160
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:32,319
can deal with that
 

2161
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,069
can deal with that
i could set a value for all of my sub

2162
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
i could set a value for all of my sub
 

2163
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,670
i could set a value for all of my sub
problems for negative ah

2164
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:37,680
problems for negative ah
 

2165
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,069
problems for negative ah
that's one thing i could do but then i

2166
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
that's one thing i could do but then i
 

2167
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,990
that's one thing i could do but then i
have to kind of remember

2168
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,000
have to kind of remember
 

2169
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,150
have to kind of remember
or i have to figure out how far i go

2170
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
or i have to figure out how far i go
 

2171
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,510
or i have to figure out how far i go
into the negative

2172
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:45,520
into the negative
 

2173
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,670
into the negative
right that's one thing i could do and i

2174
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:47,680
right that's one thing i could do and i
 

2175
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,190
right that's one thing i could do and i
give a base case for each of those cases

2176
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,200
give a base case for each of those cases
 

2177
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,390
give a base case for each of those cases
i don't have anything

2178
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,400
i don't have anything
 

2179
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,670
i don't have anything
so i get like a i don't know

2180
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:53,680
so i get like a i don't know
 

2181
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,030
so i get like a i don't know
uh zero value for playing

2182
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,040
uh zero value for playing
 

2183
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,790
uh zero value for playing
in the future right because i have

2184
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
in the future right because i have
 

2185
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,309

negative things i can't do anything with

2186
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:00,319
negative things i can't do anything with
 

2187
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,030
negative things i can't do anything with
that

2188
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,040
that
 

2189
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,270

another way of handling that which i

2190
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:03,280
another way of handling that which i
 

2191
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,390
another way of handling that which i
think i did in my

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:04,400
think i did in my
 

2193
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,750

solutions was restrict that

2194
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
solutions was restrict that
 

2195
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,390
solutions was restrict that
k to only be i guess

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,400
k to only be i guess
 

2197
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,670
k to only be i guess
and restrict that i plus

2198
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,680
and restrict that i plus
 

2199
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,270

k is less than or equal to n
and then i'll never go to negative sub

2202

and then i'll never go to negative sub
 

2203

and no base case because my relation

2256
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:39,440
and no base case because my relation
 

2257
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,230
and no base case because my relation
actually reduces to a base case

2258
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,240
actually reduces to a base case
 

2259
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,990
actually reduces to a base case
because i of the way that i wrote my

to either acknowledge that your relation
handles it

2275
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,030
when i can't do any more work right
right so and the last thing time we've

2276
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
right so and the last thing time we've
 

2277
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,150
right so and the last thing time we've
got

2278
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,160
got
 

2279
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,910
got
n sub problems exactly

2280
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
n sub problems exactly
 

2281
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,470
n sub problems exactly
times constant work per sub problem

2282
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:10,480
times constant work per sub problem
 

2283
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,510
times constant work per sub problem
because i'm looping

2284
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
because i'm looping
 

2285
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,510
because i'm looping
over 11 possible values actually it's

2286
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,520
over 11 possible values actually it's
 

2287
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,829
over 11 possible values actually it's
up to 11 right because j could be six

2288
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839

 

2289
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,950

so this is order n work total

2290
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:24,960
so this is order n work total
 

2291
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,829
so this is order n work total
okay so this is a pretty daunting first

2292
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
okay so this is a pretty daunting first
 

2293
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,270
okay so this is a pretty daunting first

when i'm do evaluating this max

2344
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920
when i'm do evaluating this max
 

2345
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,109
when i'm do evaluating this max
right i figure out which subproblem

2346
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
right i figure out which subproblem
 

2347
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,470
right i figure out which subproblem
x i recursed that gave me the max

2348
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
x i recursed that gave me the max
 

2349
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,710
x i recursed that gave me the max
and i can walk back to see which choices

2350
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720
and i can walk back to see which choices
 

2351
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,750
and i can walk back to see which choices
i made

2352
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
i made
 

2353
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,270
i made
to figure out which days i played the

2354
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
to figure out which days i played the
 

2355
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,870
to figure out which days i played the
lottery does that make sense

2356
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:46,880

 

2357
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,390

and then

2474
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:55,440
and then
 

2475
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,109
and then
the other three characters

2476
00:48:59,109 --> 00:48:59,119
the other three characters
 

2477
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,030
the other three characters
must match to make some sub strings

2478
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,040
must match to make some sub strings
 

2479
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,430

okay so uh there's that's a little hard

2484
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:09,119
okay so uh there's that's a little hard
 

2485
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,950
okay so uh there's that's a little hard
to parse so let's look at an example

2486
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:10,960
to parse so let's look at an example
 

2487
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,750
to parse so let's look at an example
here

2488

here
 

2489
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,109
here
for example alice's dna is aat

2495
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,430
if charlie's dna were c-a-t-g
they'd be matched right because c g

2496
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
they'd be matched right because c g
 

2497
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,710
they'd be matched right because c g
is a sub-sequence of charlie's dna and

00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:37,839
dna
 

2507
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,069
dna
and is also a subsequence of alice's dna

2508
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:42,079
and is also a subsequence of alice's dna
 

2509
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,950
and is also a subsequence of alice's dna
and so we've partitioned them into two

2510
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:44,960
and so we've partitioned them into two
 

2511
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,790
and so we've partitioned them into two
equal length subsequences these are not

2512
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:46,800
equal length subsequences these are not
 

2513
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,670
equal length subsequences these are not
necessarily

2514
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:47,680
necessarily
 

2515
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,150
necessarily
consecutive subsequences but just any

2516
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
consecutive subsequences but just any
 

2517
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,630
consecutive subsequences but just any
subsequences

2518
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:52,640
subsequences
 

2519
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,150
subsequences
such that uh

2520
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
such that uh
 

2521
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,109
such that uh
that that uh they appear in alice and

2522
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
that that uh they appear in alice and
 

2523
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,549
that that uh they appear in alice and
bob

2524
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:00,559
bob
 

2525
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,589
bob
but if charlie would be found to be an

2526
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:03,599
but if charlie would be found to be an
 

2527
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,670
but if charlie would be found to be an
imposter if his dna sequence were

2528
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:05,680
imposter if his dna sequence were
 

2529
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,829
imposter if his dna sequence were
a g t c essentially it's easy to

2530
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:09,839
a g t c essentially it's easy to
 

2531
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:14,069
a g t c essentially it's easy to
to realize that because g and c

2532
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:14,079
to realize that because g and c
 

2533
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,910
to realize that because g and c
are swapped in terms of their ordering

2534
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
are swapped in terms of their ordering
 

2535
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,990
are swapped in terms of their ordering
and g c the letters gc

2536
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
and g c the letters gc
 

2537
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,630
and g c the letters gc
only appear in bob's dna and don't

2538
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:24,640
only appear in bob's dna and don't
 

2539
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,230
only appear in bob's dna and don't
appear in that order

2540
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
appear in that order
 

2541
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,829
appear in that order
right so it's easy to see that he's an

2542
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
right so it's easy to see that he's an
 

2543
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,430
right so it's easy to see that he's an
imposter with these strings but you can

2544
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:29,440
imposter with these strings but you can
 

2545
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,870
imposter with these strings but you can
imagine with longer strings this could

2546
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
imagine with longer strings this could
 

2547
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,870
imagine with longer strings this could
be difficult to solve

2548
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:32,880
be difficult to solve
 

2549
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,349
be difficult to solve
right so we want an n to the fourth time

2550
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:35,359
right so we want an n to the fourth time
 

2551
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:35,990
right so we want an n to the fourth time
algorithm

2552
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,000
algorithm
 

2553
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,470
algorithm
to determine whether charlie is a fraud

2554
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,480
to determine whether charlie is a fraud
 

2555
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,510
to determine whether charlie is a fraud
okay

2556
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:39,520
okay
 

2557
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,829
okay
so i actually shortened this last night

2558
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:43,839
so i actually shortened this last night
 

2559
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,750
so i actually shortened this last night
this was like twice as long on the

2560
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:45,760
this was like twice as long on the
 

2561
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,109
this was like twice as long on the
problem set so

2562
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
problem set so
 

2563
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,710
problem set so
yeah anyway so how do we approach this

2564
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,720
yeah anyway so how do we approach this
 

2565
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,750
yeah anyway so how do we approach this
problem yes

2566
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:53,760

 

2567
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,510

no they don't have to be contiguous like

2568
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:55,520
no they don't have to be contiguous like
 

2569
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,230
no they don't have to be contiguous like
in the example it would be matched if

2570
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
in the example it would be matched if
 

2571
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,470
in the example it would be matched if
c and g is a subsequence not contiguous

2572
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:02,480
c and g is a subsequence not contiguous
 

2573
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:02,950
c and g is a subsequence not contiguous
of c

2574
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
of c
 

2575
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,829
of c
a t g yeah so that's an important part

2576
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
a t g yeah so that's an important part
 

2577
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:06,630
a t g yeah so that's an important part
of this problem

2578
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
of this problem
 

2579
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,710
of this problem
i'm just i'm not trying to figure out if

2580
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,720
i'm just i'm not trying to figure out if
 

2581
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,670
i'm just i'm not trying to figure out if
there's

2582
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
there's
 

2583
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,349
there's
basically there are only two sub

2584
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
basically there are only two sub
 

2585
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,910
basically there are only two sub
contiguous subsequences of length 2n

2586
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:13,920
contiguous subsequences of length 2n
 

2587
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,430
contiguous subsequences of length 2n
that this thing can be partitioned and i

2588
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,440
that this thing can be partitioned and i
 

2589
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,349
that this thing can be partitioned and i
just look in the middle no

2590
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:17,359
just look in the middle no
 

2591
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,829
just look in the middle no
we're looking for subsequences not sub

2592
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:20,839
we're looking for subsequences not sub
 

2593
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:22,069
we're looking for subsequences not sub
strings

2594
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
strings
 

2595
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,790
strings
so they kind of interleave like this in

2596
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:24,800
so they kind of interleave like this in
 

2597
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,589
so they kind of interleave like this in
some way

2598
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:25,599
some way
 

2599
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,710
some way
and there's actually a number of

2600
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
and there's actually a number of
 

2601
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,390
and there's actually a number of
different ways i can partition that

2602
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:28,400
different ways i can partition that
 

2603
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,750
different ways i can partition that
there's actually an exponential number

2604
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:29,760
there's actually an exponential number
 

2605
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,870
there's actually an exponential number
of ways

2606
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:30,880
of ways
 

2607
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,670
of ways
so that's a problem potentially yes is

2608
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:33,680
so that's a problem potentially yes is
 

2609
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,670
so that's a problem potentially yes is
there a biological basis no there's no

2610
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:35,680
there a biological basis no there's no
 

2611
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,510
there a biological basis no there's no
biological basis to this thing

2612
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520
biological basis to this thing
 

2613
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,790
biological basis to this thing
that i know of okay all right

2614
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:40,800
that i know of okay all right
 

2615
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,829
that i know of okay all right
so how do we solve this problem

2616
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
so how do we solve this problem
 

2617
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,630
so how do we solve this problem
what problem does this look like

2618
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640

 

2619
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,950

i mean it seems like string matching

2620
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
i mean it seems like string matching
 

2621
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,790
i mean it seems like string matching
right so i might want to think it's

2622
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:52,800
right so i might want to think it's
 

2623
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,990
right so i might want to think it's
something like longest common

2624
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,000
something like longest common
 

2625
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,670
something like longest common
subsequence right

2626
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:55,680
subsequence right
 

2627
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,549
subsequence right
but here i have three sequences instead

2628
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:58,559
but here i have three sequences instead
 

2629
00:51:58,559 --> 00:51:58,870
but here i have three sequences instead
of

2630
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
of
 

2631
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,190
of
two sequences and we've got this other

2632
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:01,200
two sequences and we've got this other
 

2633
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,270
two sequences and we've got this other
weird condition

2634
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,280
weird condition
 

2635
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,670
weird condition
where we kind of need an exact partition

2636
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:05,680
where we kind of need an exact partition
 

2637
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,270
where we kind of need an exact partition
of charlie

2638
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:07,280
of charlie
 

2639
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,349
of charlie
right i need to use all of the letters

2640
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
right i need to use all of the letters
 

2641
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,270
right i need to use all of the letters
in charlie but i don't have to use all

2642
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
in charlie but i don't have to use all
 

2643
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,710
in charlie but i don't have to use all
of the letters in

2644
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
of the letters in
 

2645
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,430
of the letters in
alice and bob right so let's just let's

2646
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,440
alice and bob right so let's just let's
 

2647
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,190
alice and bob right so let's just let's
get some notation here

2648
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,200
get some notation here
 

2649
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,069
get some notation here
you know a b and c are

2650
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:22,079
you know a b and c are
 

2651
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,430
you know a b and c are
n length

2652
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,440
n length
 

2653
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:34,549
n length
strings right so what could i do

2654
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
strings right so what could i do
 

2655
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,589
strings right so what could i do
let's define some sub sub problems

2656
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:37,599
let's define some sub sub problems
 

2657
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,710
let's define some sub sub problems
if i were to

2658
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720

 

2659
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,950

go via longest common subsequence

2660
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:44,960
go via longest common subsequence
 

2661
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,230
go via longest common subsequence
i might keep track of an index of a

2662
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:48,240
i might keep track of an index of a
 

2663
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,750
i might keep track of an index of a
suffix or prefix

2664
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
suffix or prefix
 

2665
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,549
suffix or prefix
of each one of these strings right that

2666
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
of each one of these strings right that
 

2667
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,150
of each one of these strings right that
kind of makes sense

2668
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,160
kind of makes sense
 

2669
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,829
kind of makes sense
something like i j

2670
00:52:58,829 --> 00:52:58,839
something like i j
 

2671
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,870
something like i j
k where we're talking about the

2672
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
k where we're talking about the
 

2673
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,549
k where we're talking about the
suffixes uh sorry

2674
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:06,559
suffixes uh sorry
 

2675
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,710
suffixes uh sorry
that's prefixes i

2676
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
that's prefixes i
 

2677
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,549
that's prefixes i
b j and

2678
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:14,559
b j and
 

2679
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,069
b j and
c k right

2680
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
c k right
 

2681
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,990
c k right
that seems reasonable at least right

2682
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
that seems reasonable at least right
 

2683
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,750
that seems reasonable at least right
it's it's what we would do

2684
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:21,760
it's it's what we would do
 

2685
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,829
it's it's what we would do
for longest common subsequence

2686
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839

 

2687
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:29,270

what's the problem here i mean

2688
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:29,280
what's the problem here i mean
 

2689
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,230
what's the problem here i mean
i could match this guy with one of these

2690
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:32,240
i could match this guy with one of these
 

2691
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,790
i could match this guy with one of these
guys

2692
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800
guys
 

2693
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,950
guys
or decide to skip it and match one of

2694
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:34,960
or decide to skip it and match one of
 

2695
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,230
or decide to skip it and match one of
these guys and decide to skip

2696
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:36,240
these guys and decide to skip
 

2697
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,270
these guys and decide to skip
it but if i do that

2698
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,280
it but if i do that
 

2699
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:46,470
it but if i do that
i might get a subsequence

2700
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:46,480

 

2701
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,109

but actually i always need to match all

2702
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:49,119
but actually i always need to match all
 

2703
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,270
but actually i always need to match all
of c

2704
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,280

 

2705
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,390

does that make sense always need to

2706
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,400
does that make sense always need to
 

2707
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,589
does that make sense always need to
match

2708
00:53:57,589 --> 00:53:57,599
match
 

2709
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,510
match
all of c right

2710
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:01,520
all of c right
 

2711
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:10,710
all of c right
so in a sense

2712
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:10,720
so in a sense
 

2713
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,829
so in a sense
let's see let's see how can i do this uh

2714
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:15,839
let's see let's see how can i do this uh
 

2715
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,150
let's see let's see how can i do this uh
i need to match all of c but i also need

2716
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,160
i need to match all of c but i also need
 

2717
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,309
i need to match all of c but i also need
to make sure i'm using exactly n over

2718
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:20,319
to make sure i'm using exactly n over
 

2719
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,069
to make sure i'm using exactly n over
two characters

2720
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:22,079
two characters
 

2721
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,430
two characters
from c in blue and exactly n over two

2722
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:25,440
from c in blue and exactly n over two
 

2723
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,470
from c in blue and exactly n over two
characters

2724
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:26,480
characters
 

2725
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,069
characters
from c in a

2726
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:30,079
from c in a
 

2727
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,150
from c in a
does that make sense how can i

2728
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:34,160
does that make sense how can i
 

2729
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,309
does that make sense how can i
satisfy that condition now i understand

2730
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
satisfy that condition now i understand
 

2731
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,589
satisfy that condition now i understand
why i used prefixes before

2732
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:39,599
why i used prefixes before
 

2733
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,349
why i used prefixes before
and i swapped it to suffixes here

2734
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359

 

2735
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:52,390

but we'll make it work how can i

2736
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:52,400
but we'll make it work how can i
 

2737
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,430
but we'll make it work how can i
remember

2738
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:53,440
remember
 

2739
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,510
remember
how many characters i assigned from

2740
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,520
how many characters i assigned from
 

2741
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,789
how many characters i assigned from
alice versus bob right as i'm

2742
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:00,799
alice versus bob right as i'm
 

2743
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:05,349
alice versus bob right as i'm
matching characters in alice and bob

2744
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:05,359

 

2745
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,430

i need to kind of remember where they

2746
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
i need to kind of remember where they
 

2747
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,549
i need to kind of remember where they
point to

2748
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:08,559
point to
 

2749
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,829
point to
or how many i've already used in in

2750
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:11,839
or how many i've already used in in
 

2751
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,470
or how many i've already used in in
charlie so that i can give you up the

2752
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:14,480
charlie so that i can give you up the
 

2753
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,150
charlie so that i can give you up the
remainder

2754
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,160
remainder
 

2755
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,589
remainder
right in here oh actually this

2756
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599
right in here oh actually this
 

2757
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,510
right in here oh actually this
works in a different sense

2758
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:23,520
works in a different sense
 

2759
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,190
works in a different sense
there's like 18 different ways we could

2760
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
there's like 18 different ways we could
 

2761
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,950
there's like 18 different ways we could
do this so

2762
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:26,960
do this so
 

2763
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,950
do this so
okay so i need to remember

2764
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
okay so i need to remember
 

2765
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,349
okay so i need to remember
how many i've already used up so that i

2766
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:33,359
how many i've already used up so that i
 

2767
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,190
how many i've already used up so that i
can be sure to allocate exactly that

2768
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
can be sure to allocate exactly that
 

2769
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,549
can be sure to allocate exactly that
many characters in the future

2770
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:36,559
many characters in the future
 

2771
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,750
many characters in the future
to either alice or bob right

2772
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:39,760
to either alice or bob right
 

2773
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,990
to either alice or bob right
so how can i remember that

2774
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,000

 

2775
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:56,309

i can just remember how many do i

2776
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319

 

2777
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,710

i'll do it the way that i did it before

2778
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:00,720
i'll do it the way that i did it before
 

2779
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,270
i'll do it the way that i did it before
which is i can remember i can remember

2780
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:03,280
which is i can remember i can remember
 

2781
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,470
which is i can remember i can remember
two different things here

2782
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,480
two different things here
 

2783
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,950
two different things here
i can remember how many things i have

2784
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:06,960
i can remember how many things i have
 

2785
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,829
i can remember how many things i have
left to match in alice

2786
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839
left to match in alice
 

2787
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,990
left to match in alice
in c where i can remember how many

2788
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:12,000
in c where i can remember how many
 

2789
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,109
in c where i can remember how many
things i've

2790
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
things i've
 

2791
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,549
things i've
already matched nc to alice

2792
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
already matched nc to alice
 

2793
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,829
already matched nc to alice
okay if i talk about how many things

2794
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:19,839
okay if i talk about how many things
 

2795
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:20,230
okay if i talk about how many things
i've

2796
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
i've
 

2797
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,589
i've
already matched then i can index this

2798
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:23,599
already matched then i can index this
 

2799
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:23,990
already matched then i can index this
thing

2800
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
thing
 

2801
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,190
thing
by the sum of those things if i talk

2802
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:27,200
by the sum of those things if i talk
 

2803
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,309
by the sum of those things if i talk
about

2804
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:28,319
about
 

2805
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,549
about
how many things i have yet to match i

2806
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
how many things i have yet to match i
 

2807
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:31,510
how many things i have yet to match i
have to do like n

2808
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,520
have to do like n
 

2809
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,030
have to do like n
minus the things okay

2810
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
minus the things okay
 

2811
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,589
minus the things okay
so those are the different parameters we

2812
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:37,599
so those are the different parameters we
 

2813
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,069
so those are the different parameters we
can do

2814
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:38,079
can do
 

2815
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,829
can do
we'll do what's in my notes and i'll try

2816
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:39,839
we'll do what's in my notes and i'll try
 

2817
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,190
we'll do what's in my notes and i'll try
to fix it

2818
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200

 

2819
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,710

okay so

2820
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
okay so
 

2821
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,910
okay so
what we're going to do is remember or

2822
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
what we're going to do is remember or
 

2823
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,870
what we're going to do is remember or
figure out how many things i'm still

2824
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:52,880
figure out how many things i'm still
 

2825
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,230
figure out how many things i'm still
needing to match

2826
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:54,240
needing to match
 

2827
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,789
needing to match
in c to alice and bob right so i'm going

2828
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:56,799
in c to alice and bob right so i'm going
 

2829
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:57,990
in c to alice and bob right so i'm going
to call this

2830
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
to call this
 

2831
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,190
to call this

c right so i in a sense i don't need to

2910
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:14,160
c right so i in a sense i don't need to
 

2911
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,230
c right so i in a sense i don't need to
remember that information again

2912
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,240
remember that information again
 

2913
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,910
remember that information again
it's not independent to my other

2914
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:17,920
it's not independent to my other
 

2915
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,430
it's not independent to my other
parameters i can compute it

2916
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:19,440
parameters i can compute it
 

2917
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,589
parameters i can compute it
right i can throw it in but i can

2918
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:21,599
right i can throw it in but i can
 

2919
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,750
right i can throw it in but i can
determine it from the other parameters

2920
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:23,760
determine it from the other parameters
 

2921
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,109
determine it from the other parameters
right so i want to match it with the

2922
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
right so i want to match it with the
 

2923
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,069
right so i want to match it with the
suffix

2924
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:28,079
suffix
 

2925
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,349

2927
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:36,309

j so i think this is the only part that

2928
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:36,319
j so i think this is the only part that
 

2929
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,910
j so i think this is the only part that
is going to be annoying to me okay

2930
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:39,920
is going to be annoying to me okay
 

2931
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,829
is going to be annoying to me okay
so this should be suffix

2932
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:44,839

 

2933
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:53,670

it's just this and why is that

2940
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:03,839
it's just this and why is that
 

2941
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,030
it's just this and why is that
okay if i've matched everything

2942
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,040
okay if i've matched everything
 

2943

k i and kj are both zero
 

2945
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,030
k i and kj are both zero
and i should have nothing in c which

2946
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,040
and i should have nothing in c which
 

2947
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:13,750

we're zero index yes we are i use

2952
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:19,440
we're zero index yes we are i use
 

2953
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,109
we're zero index yes we are i use

does this make sense as a sub problem i

2958
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:26,240
does this make sense as a sub problem i
 

2959
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,390
does this make sense as a sub problem i
mean it's confusing

2960
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:28,400
mean it's confusing
 

2961
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,069
mean it's confusing
but hopefully it makes sense right what

2962
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:30,079
but hopefully it makes sense right what
 

2963
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,270
but hopefully it makes sense right what
i'm going to try to do is i'm going to

2964
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:31,280
i'm going to try to do is i'm going to
 

2965
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:31,910
i'm going to try to do is i'm going to
match

2966
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:31,920

01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:34,950
some number of characters in this subfix
which is

2970
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:34,960
which is
 

2971
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,230
which is
hopefully longer than kj ki right

2972
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:38,240
hopefully longer than kj ki right
 

2973
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,990
hopefully longer than kj ki right
otherwise it's i'm going to be in a base

2974
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,000
otherwise it's i'm going to be in a base
 

2975
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,069
otherwise it's i'm going to be in a base
case where this is impossible

what is this going to equal all right
 

2995
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,670
what is this going to equal all right
well we've got booleans so this is

2996
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:11,680
well we've got booleans so this is
 

2997
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,750
well we've got booleans so this is

right
 

3003
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,829
right
so i just need some sub problem i

01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,630
of a bunch of choices boolean cases
any one of which may be true

3012
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:36,640

 

3013
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,150

i want to combine a bunch of them i just

3014
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:38,160
i want to combine a bunch of them i just
 

3015
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,710
i want to combine a bunch of them i just
want to see if any of them are true

3016
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:40,720
want to see if any of them are true
 

3017
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,069
want to see if any of them are true
i'm going to or over them okay

3018
01:01:44,069 --> 01:01:44,079
i'm going to or over them okay
 

3019
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,309
i'm going to or over them okay
and i'm going to or over four choices

3020
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:48,319
and i'm going to or over four choices
 

3021
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:52,069
and i'm going to or over four choices
okay what are my choices

3022
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:52,079
okay what are my choices
 

3023
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,349
okay what are my choices
either the the first thing in a

3024
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:55,359
either the the first thing in a
 

3025
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,750
either the the first thing in a
matches with c the first thing in b

3026
01:01:59,750 --> 01:01:59,760
matches with c the first thing in b
 

3027
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,270
matches with c the first thing in b
matches with c or i don't match with

3028
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,280
matches with c or i don't match with
 

3029
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,470
matches with c or i don't match with
either

3030
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:04,480
either
 

3031
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,750
either
right so those are my four tropes

3032
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:07,760
right so those are my four tropes
 

3033
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,430
right so those are my four tropes
so if i match with a

3034
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
so if i match with a
 

3035
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,190
so if i match with a
i plus one i recurse on a smaller suffix

3036
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:15,200
i plus one i recurse on a smaller suffix
 

3037
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,630
i plus one i recurse on a smaller suffix
of a

3038
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
of a
 

3039
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,789
of a
and a

3040
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:20,799
and a
 

3041
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,950
and a
by adding oh this all just works great

3042
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
by adding oh this all just works great
 

3043
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,109
by adding oh this all just works great
kj this is i

3044
01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:29,119

 

3045
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,390

if a i

3046
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400
if a i
 

3047
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,510
if a i
equals c i

3048
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:37,520

 

3049
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,190

and a i

3050
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,200
and a i
 

3051
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,390
and a i
is greater than zero right so if

3052
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:44,400
is greater than zero right so if
 

3053
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,910
is greater than zero right so if
k i is greater than zero i need to match

3054
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:47,920
k i is greater than zero i need to match
 

3055
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,950
k i is greater than zero i need to match
an i

3056
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:48,960
an i
 

3057
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,150
an i
right so this this conditional doesn't

3058
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
right so this this conditional doesn't
 

3059
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,670
right so this this conditional doesn't
even make sense

3060
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:53,680
even make sense
 

3061
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,789
even make sense
unless i've evaluated this k i to be

3062
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:56,799
unless i've evaluated this k i to be
 

3063
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:58,470
unless i've evaluated this k i to be
bigger than zero otherwise i'm trying to

3064
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,480
bigger than zero otherwise i'm trying to
 

3065
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,910
bigger than zero otherwise i'm trying to
access i

3066
01:02:59,910 --> 01:02:59,920
access i
 

3067
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,549
access i
of n right so i'm just putting this

3068
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559
of n right so i'm just putting this
 

3069
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:03,829
of n right so i'm just putting this
conditional on there

3070
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:03,839
conditional on there
 

3071
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,870
conditional on there
same with matching b i

3072
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:06,880
same with matching b i
 

3073
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,910
same with matching b i
j plus one k i

3080
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:19,119

3081
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,150

have to

3082
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
have to
 

3083
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,430
have to
recurse on so that's a typo in my notes

3084
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:23,440
recurse on so that's a typo in my notes
 

3085
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,750
recurse on so that's a typo in my notes
uh b

3086
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:27,760
uh b
 

3087
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,029
uh b
j equals c

3088
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
j equals c
 

3089
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,150
j equals c
oh this is not ci what is this it's

3090
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
oh this is not ci what is this it's
 

3091
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,750
oh this is not ci what is this it's
whatever that thing is

3092
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:35,760
whatever that thing is
 

3093
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,349
whatever that thing is
so i'm going to just say question mark

3094
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:41,359

 

3095
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,589

and kj is greater than 0.

3096
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:45,599
and kj is greater than 0.
 

3097
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,510
and kj is greater than 0.
so i'll fill that in in the notes it's

3098
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:47,520
so i'll fill that in in the notes it's
 

3099
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,270
so i'll fill that in in the notes it's
going to be some complicated expression

3100
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:49,280
going to be some complicated expression
 

3101
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,950
going to be some complicated expression
that looks like that

3102
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:50,960
that looks like that
 

3103
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,150
that looks like that
okay it's exactly that expression

3104
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
okay it's exactly that expression
 

3105
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:04,789
okay it's exactly that expression
yes that it is so it's it's that thing

3106
01:04:04,789 --> 01:04:04,799

 

3107
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:09,029

okay then

3108
01:04:09,029 --> 01:04:09,039
okay then
 

3109
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,029
okay then
we have two more choices either i

3110
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:13,039
we have two more choices either i
 

3111
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,430
we have two more choices either i
if i if i didn't match a i

3112
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440

 

3113
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,150

i may match bj in the future so i only

3114
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
i may match bj in the future so i only
 

3115
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:20,870
i may match bj in the future so i only
want to

3116
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
want to
 

3117
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,990
want to
reduce ai so x i

3118
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,000
reduce ai so x i
 

3119
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:31,349
reduce ai so x i
plus 1 i leave everything else the same

3120
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359

 

3121
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:35,349

assuming if i

3122
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:35,359
assuming if i
 

3123
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,870
assuming if i
less than n right i don't want to

3124
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
less than n right i don't want to
 

3125
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,230
less than n right i don't want to
move off the end of this thing or

3126
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240
move off the end of this thing or
 

3127
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,349
move off the end of this thing or
x i j plus 1

3128
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:45,359

if j is less than n
 

3133
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,190
if j is less than n
okay so those are my four choices if i

3134
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
okay so those are my four choices if i
 

3135
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,710
okay so those are my four choices if i
match the letter i'm great

3136
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:56,720
match the letter i'm great
 

3137
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,630
match the letter i'm great
otherwise i decrease the size of my sub

3138
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:58,640
otherwise i decrease the size of my sub
 

3139
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,549
otherwise i decrease the size of my sub
problem and i recurse

3140
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:00,559
problem and i recurse
 

3141
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,470
problem and i recurse
okay

3142
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480

 

3143
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,270

so fun recursion topological sort right

3144
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:09,280
so fun recursion topological sort right
 

3145
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,470
so fun recursion topological sort right
these subproblems only

3146
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:12,480
these subproblems only
 

3147
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,829
these subproblems only
depend on

3148
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
depend on
 

3149
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,109
depend on
what larger i

3150
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:19,119
what larger i
 

3151
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,230
what larger i
not quite larger j

3152
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,240
not quite larger j
 

3153
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,589
not quite larger j
not quite changing

3154
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:25,599
not quite changing
 

3155
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:29,829
not quite changing
k or d don't even change here

3156
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:29,839
k or d don't even change here
 

3157
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:34,069
k or d don't even change here
so we're going to use depend on larger

3158
01:05:34,069 --> 01:05:34,079
so we're going to use depend on larger
 

3159
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,190
so we're going to use depend on larger
i guess strictly

3160
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200
i guess strictly
 

3161
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,990
i guess strictly
that's kind of an important thing i plus

3162
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:40,000
that's kind of an important thing i plus
 

3163
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,630
that's kind of an important thing i plus
j

3164
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:40,640
j
 

3165
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,390
j
right because at least one of these two

3166
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:42,400
right because at least one of these two
 

3167
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,829
right because at least one of these two
things is increasing

3168
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839
things is increasing
 

3169
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,630
things is increasing
and then the nice thing about that is it

3170
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:46,640
and then the nice thing about that is it
 

3171
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,270
and then the nice thing about that is it
kind of tells us when we should stop

3172
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:49,280
kind of tells us when we should stop
 

3173
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,470
kind of tells us when we should stop
right we should stop when either i

3174
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:52,480
right we should stop when either i
 

3175
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,829
right we should stop when either i
or j get to n we should know

3176
01:05:55,829 --> 01:05:55,839
or j get to n we should know
 

3177
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,309
or j get to n we should know
enough at that point to be able to

3178
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:58,319
enough at that point to be able to
 

3179
01:05:58,319 --> 01:05:59,510
enough at that point to be able to
determine

01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
determine
 

3181
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,950
determine
if we succeeded or not possible

01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:04,960
if we succeeded or not possible
 

3183
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,150
if we succeeded or not possible
so we have our base case

3184
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,160

 

3185
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,190

01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,789
what's the easy base case when
we succeeded when have we succeeded

right otherwise this thing is zero

right otherwise this thing is zero
and we'll just try to match everything

and we'll just try to match everything
 

3245
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,069
and we'll just try to match everything
up here and eventually

up here and eventually
 

3247
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,910
up here and eventually
we'll get down to this base case or

01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:43,920
we'll get down to this base case or
 

3249
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,109
we'll get down to this base case or
something where

01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:45,119
something where
 

3251
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,309
something where
this thing goes to zero and we've got a

this thing goes to zero and we've got a
 

3253
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,190
this thing goes to zero and we've got a
problem

3254
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200

 

3255
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,270

it's the same goes for the other side as

3256
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:53,280
it's the same goes for the other side as
 

3257
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,190
it's the same goes for the other side as
well if we run out of things

3258
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:55,200
well if we run out of things
 

3259
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,750
well if we run out of things
in b

3260
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760

 

3261
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,589

when the number of things we need to

3262
01:08:01,589 --> 01:08:01,599
when the number of things we need to
 

3263
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,150
when the number of things we need to
match in b is greater than zero okay so

3264
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,160
match in b is greater than zero okay so
 

3265
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,109
match in b is greater than zero okay so
those are our base cases

3266
01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:07,119
those are our base cases
 

3267
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:13,910
those are our base cases
the original problem is what

3268
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:13,920

 

3269
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,829

yeah it's just gonna be one of our sub

3270
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:15,839
yeah it's just gonna be one of our sub
 

3271
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:17,829
yeah it's just gonna be one of our sub
problems n n

3272
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:17,839
problems n n
 

3273
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,390
problems n n
and then n over two and n over two right

3274
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,400
and then n over two and n over two right
 

3275
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,749
and then n over two and n over two right
i'm trying to match

right

3282
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:28,960

 

3283
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,630

zero thank you uh

zero thank you uh
 

3285
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,430
zero thank you uh
because we're zero index yes again

3286
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:35,440
because we're zero index yes again
 

3287
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,789
because we're zero index yes again
that's

3288
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:36,799
that's
 

3289
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,870
that's
switching from prefix suffixes in the

3290
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:38,880
switching from prefix suffixes in the
 

3291
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,950
switching from prefix suffixes in the
middle was fun so anyway

3292
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:40,960
middle was fun so anyway
 

3293
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,990
middle was fun so anyway
and it better be the case that n is two

3294
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:44,000
and it better be the case that n is two
 

3295
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,390

or else it's obviously false or it is

and then the last thing which i'm not

3302
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:53,279
and then the last thing which i'm not
 

3303
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,550
and then the last thing which i'm not
going to write down

3304
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:54,560
going to write down
 

3305
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,470
going to write down
is we have a constant work here

3306
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:58,480
is we have a constant work here
 

3307
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,789
is we have a constant work here
right because i'm just checking the

3308
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:00,799
right because i'm just checking the
 

3309
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,990
right because i'm just checking the
value of

3310
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:02,000
value of
 

3311
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,189
value of
four sub-problems and a conditional for

3312
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:05,199
four sub-problems and a conditional for
 

3313
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:06,789
four sub-problems and a conditional for
each

3314
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:06,799
each
 

3315
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:10,070
each
and i have how many sub problems i loops

3316
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,080
and i have how many sub problems i loops
 

3317
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,709
and i have how many sub problems i loops
over n

3318
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:10,719
over n
 

3319
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,309
over n
j loops over n k and k j loop over n

3320
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:14,319
j loops over n k and k j loop over n
 

3321
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,030
j loops over n k and k j loop over n
over two

3322
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:15,040
over two
 

3323
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,510
over two
so i get a quartic number of sub

3324
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:17,520
so i get a quartic number of sub
 

3325
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,630
so i get a quartic number of sub
problems

3326
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:18,640
problems
 

3327
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,430
problems
cortic running time as desired okay so

3328
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:21,440
cortic running time as desired okay so
 

3329
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,110
cortic running time as desired okay so
i'm not going to write that down

3330
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:23,120
i'm not going to write that down
 

3331
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,510
i'm not going to write that down
because i'm quite a bit late

3332
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:27,520
because i'm quite a bit late
 

3333
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,110
because i'm quite a bit late
i'm probably going to do just do one

3334
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:29,120
i'm probably going to do just do one
 

3335
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,349
i'm probably going to do just do one
more problem which is sad because the

3336
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:31,359
more problem which is sad because the
 

3337
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,269
more problem which is sad because the
last one is about gokimonpo

3338
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:33,279
last one is about gokimonpo
 

3339
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,870
last one is about gokimonpo
which is a fun fun problem gokimonpo

which is a fun fun problem gokimonpo
 

3341
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,510
which is a fun fun problem gokimonpo
basically relies on i'm trying to catch

basically relies on i'm trying to catch
 

3343
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,990
basically relies on i'm trying to catch
a bunch of pocket monsters

3344
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:42,000
a bunch of pocket monsters
 

3345
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,070
a bunch of pocket monsters
just monsters i think is in this and

3346
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,080
just monsters i think is in this and
 

3347
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:51,590
just monsters i think is in this and
you can either go to a location

3348
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
you can either go to a location
 

3349
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,430
you can either go to a location
and catch that monster for free

3350
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440

 

3351
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,110

but that costs money because i have to

3352
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
but that costs money because i have to
 

3353
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,669
but that costs money because i have to
ride share there okay

3354
01:09:59,669 --> 01:09:59,679
ride share there okay
 

3355
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,189
ride share there okay
or i don't have to go to that location

3356
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
or i don't have to go to that location
 

3357
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,350
or i don't have to go to that location
and i buy it on my in in-app purchase

3358
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:07,360
and i buy it on my in in-app purchase
 

3359
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,030
and i buy it on my in in-app purchase
but that cost me a different amount of

3360
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,040
but that cost me a different amount of
 

3361
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,709
but that cost me a different amount of
money okay

3362
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:10,719
money okay
 

3363
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,229
money okay
but buying it and i mean at purchase

3364
01:10:14,229 --> 01:10:14,239
but buying it and i mean at purchase
 

3365
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,550
but buying it and i mean at purchase
kept me at the location i was previously

3366
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:16,560
kept me at the location i was previously
 

3367
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,830
kept me at the location i was previously
wherever i was

3368
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:17,840
wherever i was
 

3369
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,910
wherever i was
and so the the point of that problem is

3370
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:19,920
and so the the point of that problem is
 

3371
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,669
and so the the point of that problem is
i need to remember where i was

3372
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
i need to remember where i was
 

3373
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,470
i need to remember where i was
last so that i know how far i need to

3374
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
last so that i know how far i need to
 

3375
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,669
last so that i know how far i need to
travel

3376
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:25,679
travel
 

3377
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,870
travel
to get to my next monster okay so that's

3378
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:28,880
to get to my next monster okay so that's
 

3379
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,149
to get to my next monster okay so that's
going to be the last one that i'm not

3380
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:30,159
going to be the last one that i'm not
 

3381
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,229
going to be the last one that i'm not
going to be able to get to

3382
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:32,239
going to be able to get to
 

3383
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:37,669
going to be able to get to
number three is a problem about

3384
01:10:37,669 --> 01:10:37,679
number three is a problem about
 

3385
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,110

where you know each plate has a certain
 

3411
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,390
where you know each plate has a certain
information it has a volume a number of

01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159
calories in that dish
 

3415
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,709
calories in that dish
and a sweetness label basically zero or

3416
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:16,719
and a sweetness label basically zero or
 

3417

okay but he's on a diet and he wants to

3420
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:22,480
okay but he's on a diet and he wants to
 

3421
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,550
okay but he's on a diet and he wants to
eat no more than k calories during his

3422
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560
eat no more than k calories during his
 

3423
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,750
eat no more than k calories during his
meal

3424
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:25,760
meal
 

3425
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,830
meal
but wants to fill his stomach as much as

3426
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
but wants to fill his stomach as much as
 

3427
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,350
but wants to fill his stomach as much as
possible because he wants to feel

3428
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:29,360
possible because he wants to feel
 

3429
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,350
possible because he wants to feel
full right so he wants to maximize the

3430
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:31,360
full right so he wants to maximize the
 

3431
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,350
full right so he wants to maximize the
volume that he fills

3432
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:33,360
volume that he fills
 

3433
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,630
volume that he fills
even though he wants to reduce the

3434
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:34,640
even though he wants to reduce the
 

3435
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,470
even though he wants to reduce the
number of calories like keep restrict

3436
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:36,480
number of calories like keep restrict
 

3437
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,510
number of calories like keep restrict
the number of calories

3438
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
the number of calories
 

3439
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,630
the number of calories
okay he also wants to order exactly

3440
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:40,640
okay he also wants to order exactly
 

3441
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,149
okay he also wants to order exactly
s sweet plates

3442
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
s sweet plates
 

3443
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,709
s sweet plates
okay so we've got this other condition

3444
01:11:46,709 --> 01:11:46,719
okay so we've got this other condition
 

3445
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,510
okay so we've got this other condition
where

3446
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
where
 

3447
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,910
where
i need to make sure i'm eating a certain

3448
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
i need to make sure i'm eating a certain
 

3449
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,350
i need to make sure i'm eating a certain
number of sweet plates

3450
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:51,360
number of sweet plates
 

3451
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,790
number of sweet plates
it might be useful for me to remember

3452
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
it might be useful for me to remember
 

3453
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,630
it might be useful for me to remember
how many sweet plates i've already eaten

3454
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
how many sweet plates i've already eaten
 

3455
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,790
how many sweet plates i've already eaten
so i make sure that i eat that number

3456
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
so i make sure that i eat that number
 

3457
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,830
so i make sure that i eat that number
okay

3458
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:57,840
okay
 

3459
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,750
okay
without purchasing the same dish twice

3460
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
without purchasing the same dish twice
 

3461
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,990
without purchasing the same dish twice
okay so here's a condition

3462
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:02,000
okay so here's a condition
 

3463
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,709
okay so here's a condition
that's similar to the knapsack 0-1

3464
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:04,719
that's similar to the knapsack 0-1
 

3465
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,310
that's similar to the knapsack 0-1
problem versus a knapsack

3466
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:06,320
problem versus a knapsack
 

3467
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,470
problem versus a knapsack
kind of general problem am i allowed to

kind of general problem am i allowed to
take more than one of these things or

3470
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:10,239
take more than one of these things or
 

3471
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,110
take more than one of these things or
not

3472
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:11,120
not
 

3473
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,270
not
here it's a restriction that i'm not

3474
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:13,280
here it's a restriction that i'm not
 

3475
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,310
here it's a restriction that i'm not
allowed to take

3476
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:14,320
allowed to take
 

3477
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,030
allowed to take
a plate more than once okay and i'm

3478
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:17,040
a plate more than once okay and i'm
 

3479
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,229
a plate more than once okay and i'm
going to try to describe

3480
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:18,239
going to try to describe
 

3481
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,590
going to try to describe
a order n k s time algorithm to find the

okay so first thing i'm going to note

3490
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:28,640
okay so first thing i'm going to note
 

3491
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,910
okay so first thing i'm going to note
here is the the

here is the the
 

3493
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,189
here is the the
one of the things that we talked about

3494
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
one of the things that we talked about
 

3495
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,910
one of the things that we talked about
at the last dynamic programming lecture

3496
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:33,920
at the last dynamic programming lecture
 

3497
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:39,110
at the last dynamic programming lecture
was is this a polynomial running time

3498
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
was is this a polynomial running time
 

3499
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,350
was is this a polynomial running time
that it's asking me for right actually

3500
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360
that it's asking me for right actually
 

3501
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,350
that it's asking me for right actually
on your problem set eight

3502
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,360
on your problem set eight
 

3503
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,310
on your problem set eight
you were asked on each problem to

3504
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
you were asked on each problem to
 

3505
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,910
you were asked on each problem to
categorize whether the running time of

3506
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:47,920
categorize whether the running time of
 

3507

01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:26,400
plate there are n of them so n is
 

3545
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,590

s is polynomial because s
 

3549
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,550
s is polynomial because s
is smaller than n and it's positive

01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:32,560
is smaller than n and it's positive

is representable in potentially one word

3558
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,440
is representable in potentially one word
 

3559
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,790
is representable in potentially one word
that's the assumption

3560
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:44,800
that's the assumption
 

3561
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,030
that's the assumption
but it could have exponential size

3562
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,040
but it could have exponential size
 

3563
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,870
but it could have exponential size
depending on the size of my word

3564
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:48,880
depending on the size of my word
 

3565
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,510
depending on the size of my word
of my machine i don't know how big k is

3566
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:51,520
of my machine i don't know how big k is
 

3567
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,110
of my machine i don't know how big k is
relative to n

3568
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:53,120
relative to n
 

3569
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,270
relative to n
and so this is a pseudo-polynomial

3570
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:55,280
and so this is a pseudo-polynomial
 

3571
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,030
and so this is a pseudo-polynomial
running time

3572
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
running time
 

3573
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,030

okay because k is just a number in my

3574
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
okay because k is just a number in my
 

3575
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,510
okay because k is just a number in my

3583
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:08,470
and recitation and so if we ask you on
an exam

an exam
 

3585
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,470

01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,790
running times are polynomial or not
that's the logic that you go about it

3590
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:14,800
that's the logic that you go about it
 

3591
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,229
that's the logic that you go about it
how big is my input

3592
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:18,239

 

3593
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,910

what is my running time that i'm trying

what is my running time that i'm trying
to evaluate and

3596
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
to evaluate and
 

3597
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,510
to evaluate and
can i bound each of those terms in terms

can i bound each of those terms in terms
 

3599
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,030
can i bound each of those terms in terms

if not then you say it's

3602
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:26,840
if not then you say it's
 

3603
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,149
if not then you say it's
pseudopolynomial

okay all right so let's try to

3606
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,520
okay all right so let's try to
 

3607
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,669
okay all right so let's try to
tackle this problem now already because

3608
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:33,679
tackle this problem now already because
 

3609
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,590
tackle this problem now already because
we've got pseudopolynomial

3610
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
we've got pseudopolynomial
 

3611
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,910
we've got pseudopolynomial
uh you're thinking maybe this is going

3612
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
uh you're thinking maybe this is going
 

3613
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,870
uh you're thinking maybe this is going
to be knapsack-like or subset some like

3614
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:40,880
to be knapsack-like or subset some like
 

3615
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,750
to be knapsack-like or subset some like
okay what do i need to i'm just going to

3616
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
okay what do i need to i'm just going to
 

3617
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,390
okay what do i need to i'm just going to
go straight for sub problems here

3618
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400
go straight for sub problems here
 

3619
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,310
go straight for sub problems here
uh actually i should probably say

3620
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:50,320
uh actually i should probably say
 

3621
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,990
uh actually i should probably say
what my things are meh this is fine

3622
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:54,000
what my things are meh this is fine
 

3623
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,950
what my things are meh this is fine
i gave notation up there didn't i okay

3624
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:56,960
i gave notation up there didn't i okay
 

3625
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,750
i gave notation up there didn't i okay
so

3626
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:57,760
so
 

3627
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,510
so
we're gonna have sub problems i'm gonna

3628
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
we're gonna have sub problems i'm gonna
 

3629
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,030
we're gonna have sub problems i'm gonna
i want to maximize the number

3630
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:01,040
i want to maximize the number
 

3631
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,870
i want to maximize the number
the volume of food so that should

3632
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:02,880
the volume of food so that should
 

3633
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,630
the volume of food so that should
probably be the output

3634
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:04,640
probably be the output
 

3635
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,990
probably be the output
of my sub problem the max volume on

3636
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:08,000
of my sub problem the max volume on
 

3637
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,030
of my sub problem the max volume on
some subset of dishes right

3638
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,040
some subset of dishes right
 

3639
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,630
some subset of dishes right
i'm going to choose suffixes here

3640
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:14,640
i'm going to choose suffixes here
 

3641
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,669
i'm going to choose suffixes here
i and some other stuff

3642
01:15:17,669 --> 01:15:17,679
i and some other stuff
 

3643
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:22,310
i and some other stuff
is going to be max volume

3644
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,320
is going to be max volume
 

3645
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:29,110
is going to be max volume
of food possible

3646
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120

 

3647
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:34,470

uh for plates

3648
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:34,480

 

3649
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,790

p i to p n i'm gonna assume one index

3650
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:38,800
p i to p n i'm gonna assume one index
 

3651
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,350
p i to p n i'm gonna assume one index
here because

3652
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
here because
 

3653
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,110
here because
why not

3654
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,120

 

3655
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,030

but do i need to remember information

3656
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
but do i need to remember information
 

3657
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,709
but do i need to remember information
along the way

3658
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
along the way
 

3659
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,430
along the way
yeah just like with subset sum or

3660
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
yeah just like with subset sum or
 

3661
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,709
yeah just like with subset sum or
knapsack

3662
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
knapsack
 

3663
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,910
knapsack
i need i have this calorie limit

3664
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:53,920
i need i have this calorie limit
 

3665
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,990
i need i have this calorie limit
right so it's going to be really useful

3666
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,000
right so it's going to be really useful
 

3667
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,590
right so it's going to be really useful
for me to know how many calories i've

3668
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:57,600
for me to know how many calories i've
 

3669
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,149
for me to know how many calories i've
already

3670
01:15:58,149 --> 01:15:58,159
already
 

3671
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,550
already
eaten or how many calories i have left

3672
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
eaten or how many calories i have left
 

3673
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,830
eaten or how many calories i have left
in my budget

3674
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:01,840
in my budget
 

3675
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,430
in my budget
right so let's say j

3676
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
right so let's say j
 

3677
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,470
right so let's say j
uh using

3678
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:10,480
uh using
 

3679
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,510
uh using
at most j

3680
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
at most j
 

3681
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,950
at most j
calories right from the remaining dishes

3682
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:18,960
calories right from the remaining dishes
 

3683
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,310
calories right from the remaining dishes
and i need to make sure that i'm eating

3684
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:22,320
and i need to make sure that i'm eating
 

3685
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,510
and i need to make sure that i'm eating
exactly

3686
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,520
exactly
 

3687
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,030
exactly
some number of sweet plates in the

3688
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,040
some number of sweet plates in the
 

3689
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,550
some number of sweet plates in the
future

3690
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:26,560
future
 

3691
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,270
future
and i need to remember as i eat a sweet

3692
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280
and i need to remember as i eat a sweet
 

3693
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:29,990
and i need to remember as i eat a sweet
plate

3694
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:30,000
plate
 

3695
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,669
plate
the number of sweet plates i need to eat

3696
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:31,679
the number of sweet plates i need to eat
 

3697
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,910
the number of sweet plates i need to eat
decreases and so i want to generalize

3698
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:33,920
decreases and so i want to generalize
 

3699
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,270
decreases and so i want to generalize
that i'm going to put

3700
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
that i'm going to put
 

3701
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,390
that i'm going to put
an s prime here to denote eating

3702
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:40,400

 

3703
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,149

exactly

3704
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159

 

3705
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:48,070

s sweet

3706
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,080
s sweet
 

3707
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,590

plates okay

3708
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:51,600
plates okay
 

3709
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,390
plates okay
so that's my sub problem

3710
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,400

 

3711
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,830

let's i've got tons of board space i'm

3712
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:57,840
let's i've got tons of board space i'm
 

3713
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,830
let's i've got tons of board space i'm
going to go ahead and use it

3714
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:00,840
going to go ahead and use it
 

3715
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,070
going to go ahead and use it
relation

3716
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080

01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,350

we've got x i j s

3723
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,910

probably i want to be maximizing over

3724
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:13,920
probably i want to be maximizing over
 

3725
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,110

if you don't if you just list a bunch of

3744
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:35,760
if you don't if you just list a bunch of
 

3745

options here
 

3747
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,189

and don't tell us how to combine them

3748
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
and don't tell us how to combine them
 

3749
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,630
and don't tell us how to combine them
that's going to be a problem because we

3750
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:40,640
that's going to be a problem because we
 

3751
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,990
that's going to be a problem because we
don't know what your dynamic program is

3752
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,000
don't know what your dynamic program is
 

3753

so it's really useful for you to be able

3756
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
so it's really useful for you to be able
 

3757

so it's really useful for you to be able
to tell us

to tell us
 

3759
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,830
to tell us
how you're combining your sub problems

3760
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:47,840
how you're combining your sub problems
 

3761
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,990
how you're combining your sub problems
here we're doing a maximization

3762
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,000
here we're doing a maximization
 

3763
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,310
here we're doing a maximization
over the different volumes possible if

3764
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
over the different volumes possible if
 

3765
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,189
over the different volumes possible if
we

3766
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
we
 

3767
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:57,669
we
decide to eat the plate i

3768
01:17:57,669 --> 01:17:57,679
decide to eat the plate i
 

3769
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:01,350
decide to eat the plate i
then we get v i in volume

3770
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:01,360
then we get v i in volume
 

3771
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,310
then we get v i in volume
we fill our tummies with vi and volume

3772
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
we fill our tummies with vi and volume
 

3773
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,630
we fill our tummies with vi and volume
but then we have to recurse on using

3774
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:06,640
but then we have to recurse on using
 

3775
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,709
but then we have to recurse on using
one fewer plate because we can't use

3776
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
one fewer plate because we can't use
 

3777
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,950
one fewer plate because we can't use
that plate again

3778
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:10,960
that plate again
 

3779
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,270
that plate again
and we've decreased the amount of

3780
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:13,280
and we've decreased the amount of
 

3781
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,669
and we've decreased the amount of
calories in our budget

3782
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
calories in our budget
 

3783
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:19,030
calories in our budget
and i'm going to say s prime

3784
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:19,040
and i'm going to say s prime
 

3785
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,950
and i'm going to say s prime
minus s i because

3786
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:22,960
minus s i because
 

3787
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,470
minus s i because
s i is one if it's sweet

3788
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:26,480
s i is one if it's sweet
 

3789
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,189
s i is one if it's sweet
and zero if it's not so it's kind of

3790
01:18:29,189 --> 01:18:29,199
and zero if it's not so it's kind of
 

3791
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:30,149
and zero if it's not so it's kind of
nice that they

3792
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:30,159
nice that they
 

3793
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:31,910
nice that they
kind of gave us this notation here i can

3794
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:31,920
kind of gave us this notation here i can
 

3795
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,669
kind of gave us this notation here i can
just subtract it off

3796
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
just subtract it off
 

3797
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,189
just subtract it off
if it's there i don't have to do this

3798
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:35,199
if it's there i don't have to do this
 

3799
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,990
if it's there i don't have to do this
conditional or something

3800
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:38,000
conditional or something
 

3801
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,070
conditional or something
and i don't ever want to go below these

3802
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,080
and i don't ever want to go below these
 

3803
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,510
and i don't ever want to go below these
budgets

3804
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:41,520
budgets
 

3805
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,790
budgets
so i'm just going to say if uh

3806
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
so i'm just going to say if uh
 

3807
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,790
so i'm just going to say if uh
c i is uh

3808
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:48,800
c i is uh
 

3809
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,149
c i is uh
less than or equal to j and s i

3810
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:52,159
less than or equal to j and s i
 

3811
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,110
less than or equal to j and s i
is less than or equal to s prime okay so

3812
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
is less than or equal to s prime okay so
 

3813
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,470
is less than or equal to s prime okay so
that's going to make sure

3814
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,480
that's going to make sure
 

3815
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,510
that's going to make sure
that i never have these guys go negative

3816
01:18:59,510 --> 01:18:59,520
that i never have these guys go negative
 

3817
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,590
that i never have these guys go negative
okay otherwise i don't eat the plate and

3818
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,600
okay otherwise i don't eat the plate and
 

3819
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,750
okay otherwise i don't eat the plate and
that's kind of the easy case

3820
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,760
that's kind of the easy case
 

3821
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,270
that's kind of the easy case
because i just go i plus 1 j

3822
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
because i just go i plus 1 j
 

3823
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,510
because i just go i plus 1 j
s prime these things didn't change i

3824
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:09,520
s prime these things didn't change i
 

3825
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,310
s prime these things didn't change i
just have one

3826
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
just have one
 

3827
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,270
just have one
fewer thing left okay so i'm maximizing

3828
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,280
fewer thing left okay so i'm maximizing
 

3829
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,070
fewer thing left okay so i'm maximizing
over these things

3830
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,080
over these things
 

3831
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,350
over these things
this one's an always it's not in it

3832
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:17,360
this one's an always it's not in it
 

3833
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,709
this one's an always it's not in it
right okay so

3834
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:20,719
right okay so
 

3835
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,790
right okay so
i just have two choices and maximizing

3836
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:22,800
i just have two choices and maximizing
 

3837
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,149
i just have two choices and maximizing

how much work per sub problem just a max
 

4007
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,149
how much work per sub problem just a max
of two things

4008
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:06,159
of two things
 

4009
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:10,950
of two things
so constant work per subproblem

4010
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:10,960

 

4011
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,070

yields order n k s

4012
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:14,080
yields order n k s
 

4013
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,510
yields order n k s
time total okay

4014
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
time total okay
 

4015
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,390
time total okay
so those are three nice practice

4016
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:20,400
so those are three nice practice
 

4017
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,669
so those are three nice practice

01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,510
remembering additional information
that's not an not really a pseudo

4032
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:35,520
that's not an not really a pseudo
 

4033

01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,040
in your problem but it's the location of
 

4037
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,310
in your problem but it's the location of
where i was

4038
